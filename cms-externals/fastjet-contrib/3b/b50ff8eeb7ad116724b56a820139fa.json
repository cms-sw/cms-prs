The cmake install vastly simplifies the building and management of python bindings built here: https://github.com/scikit-hep/fastjet, perhaps similar justification exists here. \r\n\r\nIt's root-dir only + patchset for windows so that the code changes are minimal and it's easy to continue merging with updates from fjcontrib. The root CMakeLists.txt generates all subsequently required CMakeLists.txts in subdirectories. I have tested this on linux (x86 and arm), macos, and windows. All tests we could run pass.\r\n\r\nExample configuration command, assuming fastjet and siscone are not in the CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH:\r\n```\r\ncmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=INSTALL/PATH -Dfastjet_DIR=PATH/TO/lib/cmake/fastjet -Dsiscone_DIR=PATH/TO/lib/cmake/siscone -DFASTJETCONTRIB_ENABLE_FRAGILELIB=ON # (or OFF)\r\n```\r\n\r\nPresently this PR does not change the build process for the cms-external away from autotools, but merely enables the possibility of using cmake.", "branch": "cms/v1.101", "changed_files": 8, "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1749305841", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["orp-pending", "tests-pending", "pending-signatures", "externals-pending"], "number": 19, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "cmake-based build for fastjet-contrib (cmake requires fastjet >=3.5.0, siscone >=3.1.1 also built with cmake)", "updated_at": "1749315123", "user": "lgray"}

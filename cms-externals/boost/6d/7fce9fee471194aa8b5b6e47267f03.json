I went and modified all the places our code might reach a function that calls `boost::interprocess_exception` and forces it to also pass a `const char*` saying why the exception is being thrown. \r\n\r\nHopefully this will help track down the problems we see ever so often.\r\n", "branch": "cms/v1.80.0", "changed_files": 8, "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1671131275", "deletions": 48, "labels": ["orp-pending", "tests-approved", "pending-signatures", "externals-pending"], "number": 3, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 11, "state": "open", "title": "Better annotate interprocess_exception", "updated_at": "1671181036", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

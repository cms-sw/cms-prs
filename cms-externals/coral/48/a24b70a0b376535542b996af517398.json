The limit is 200, hard-coded.  When the pool is full, new connections are closed and no longer saved. \r\n\r\nThis fix is relevant for hlt-related workflows running on reply mode, where the latency between the lumisection switch is short and causes the pile-up of frontier-related file descriptors.\r\n", "branch": "cms/CORAL_2_3_21", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1619031739", "comments": 4, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1619008064", "deletions": 12, "labels": ["externals-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "03471dd59bed93d6e20ad6c4b6258d3f65821066", "merged_at": "1619031739", "merged_by": "mrodozov", "number": 4, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix for limiting idle connection pool size", "updated_at": "1619031739", "user": "ggovi"}

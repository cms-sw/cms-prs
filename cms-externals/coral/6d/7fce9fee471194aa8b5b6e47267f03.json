In particular, no lifetime defined was falling in this category, since the default value for the lifetime is 300 sec. \r\nThe effect of this bug was essentially the indefinite increasing of the idle connections in the pool.  It was likely NOT impacting the UPDATE access patterns on Oracle (since they are usually using a single connection ), but it appeared to be very disrupting on the READ-ONLY access pattern with frequent queries on Frontier. \r\nThe fix is very simple, involve only 2 classes and it has been tested, showing that it solved the memory leak problem due to the increasing connection in the idle pool.", "branch": "cms/CORAL_2_3_21", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1617117410", "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1617030198", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["externals-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "e5e16de83fca650747de3bdb266ca94cf4aa6afa", "merged_at": "1617117410", "merged_by": "smuzaffar", "number": 3, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Bug fix for the DB connection lifetime", "updated_at": "1617117437", "user": "ggovi"}

However, this is only necessary when using the Microsoft compiler. In the other cases, the nonstdint.h header is just an alias to the system stdint.h, which is where the INT<N>_MAX macros get defined in any case.\r\n\r\nProbably, this error was not relevant before, because somehow the `stdint.h` header that defines this macro was always included before `classlib/utils/IntBits.h` in CMSSW, and only my differnt Linux environment has that problem (so far).", "branch": "cms/3.1.3", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1695379786", "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1695222664", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["tests-approved", "orp-pending", "externals-pending", "pending-signatures"], "merge_commit_sha": "b43e382237aa91d7dfcc9ef4d8642c7abd9b08c4", "merged_at": "1695379786", "merged_by": "smuzaffar", "number": 3, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Only require `__STDC_LIMIT_MACROS` to be defined when building with MSC", "updated_at": "1695379787", "user": "guitargeek"}

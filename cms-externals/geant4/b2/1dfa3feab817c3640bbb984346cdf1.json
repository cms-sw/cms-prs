Most of these fixes are technical. Essential for CMS simulation:\r\n\r\n1) G4GammaGeneralProcess - avoid rare cases when concrete Geant4 process is not chosen due to inaccurate arithmetics.\r\n2) G4NeutronGeneralProcess - removed unnecessary double computation of cross section.\r\n3) Added to the list of processes forgotten new process of muon pair production by muons\r\n\r\nIn general, this patch may change simulation history but for some WF regression may be preserved due to limited statistics.\r\n\r\nAfter merge of this  PR new PRs to use updated Geant4 11.1 should be created for GEANT4 and G4VECGEOM branches of CMSSW.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "cms/v11.1.0", "changed_files": 10, "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1672647064", "deletions": 119, "labels": ["orp-pending", "tests-rejected", "pending-signatures", "externals-pending"], "number": 67, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Collection of fixes for Geant4 11.1", "updated_at": "1673005767", "user": "civanch"}

After investigation it turn out that there is rare problem in simulation of mu- absorption at rest  by the Bertini cascade, when kinematics of final state may be broken. The fix preserves the same method of sampling, so simulation history will not be changed until such rare event, for which the problem was observed. After such event the simulation history will diverse. So, in standard jenkins tests results should agree with the baseline due to limited statistic. No change of any physics observable is expected. The fix should be back ported to Geant4 10.2, whihc is used in CMSW_9_3_X and 9_4_X.", "branch": "cms/4.10.04", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1529664990", "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1529651011", "deletions": 10, "labels": ["externals-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "2c6f52a6be1b368573f23289e4af6a7e6205b65e", "merged_at": "1529664990", "merged_by": "smuzaffar", "number": 33, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fixed muon stopping", "updated_at": "1529664990", "user": "civanch"}

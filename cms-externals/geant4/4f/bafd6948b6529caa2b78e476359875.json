After investigation it turn out that there is rare problem in simulation of mu- absorption at rest  by the Bertini cascade, when kinematics of final state may be broken. The fix change preserve the same method of sampling, so simulation history will not change until these rare event, after that the simulation history will diverse. So, in standard jenkins tests results should agree with the baseline due to limited statistic. No change of any physics observable is expected.

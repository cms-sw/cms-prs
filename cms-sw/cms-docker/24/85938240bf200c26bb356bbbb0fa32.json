I suggest we try to update the changelog along with the package update. It could be nice to link or explain the update reason in the changelog too.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAndrea", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1696834596", "comments": 1, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1696834576", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "externals-pending", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "cd4eea00fdc5361873f809e25a5f48bd2142873c", "merged_at": "1696834596", "merged_by": "aandvalenzuela", "number": 225, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Start el8 and el9 changelog", "updated_at": "1696834596", "user": "aandvalenzuela"}

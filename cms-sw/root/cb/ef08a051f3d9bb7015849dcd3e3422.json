This causes incompatibility with PyROOT, because `char *` is automatically converted to a Python string, which is the wrong thing to for an address.\r\n\r\nThis made the return value unusable in PyROOT. That's a bug that currently prevents us from reimplementing some pythonizations in native Python.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the return type of `TBranch::GetAddress()` was changed to `void *` in this release. Even if this change is not backwards compatible for typing reasons, the returned value is the same.\r\n\r\nWith this change, the code is also more consistent because `GetAddress()` and `SetBranchAddress()` use the same type for the address.", "branch": "cms/master/953770d5da", "changed_files": 9, "comments": 4, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1706253214", "deletions": 17, "labels": ["orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "externals-pending"], "number": 197, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[tree] Change return type of TBranch::GetAddress() et al to `void*`", "updated_at": "1706280575", "user": "smuzaffar"}

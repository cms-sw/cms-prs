The ```-c``` flag was chosen to replicate what ```git switch -c <branch>``` does. On top, AFAICT from the ```git cherry-pick``` documentation, the ```-c``` flag has no meaning for ```git cherry-pick```.\r\n\r\nThe code contains logic to delete the new branch in case any later operation fails.\r\n\r\nTested manually under ```CMSSW_15_1_0_pre5```. Validating it with a random non-existing commit activates the ```trap```, and works as expected:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nbfontana@sess-mi300x:/shared/PF_Validation/src  (PF_Sim_Validation) $ /afs/cern.ch/user/b/bfontana/cms-git-tools/git-cms-cherry-pick -C NEW_BRANCH 111111111   \r\nSwitched to a new branch 'NEW_BRANCH'\r\nfatal: ambiguous argument '111111111': unknown revision or path not in the working tree.\r\nUse '--' to separate paths from revisions, like this:\r\n'git <command> [<revision>...] -- [<file>...]'\r\nfatal: bad revision '111111111'\r\nSwitched to branch 'PF_Sim_Validation'\r\nDeleted branch NEW_BRANCH (was 337299c6945).\r\n```", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1764665900", "comments": 10, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1758636986", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "externals-pending", "tests-pending", "ngt"], "merge_commit_sha": "3a9b0d4071871bf3a7ba4cfc105f8935978562f2", "merged_at": "1764665900", "merged_by": "smuzaffar", "number": 131, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Support the creation of a new branch before cherry-picking.", "updated_at": "1764665900", "user": "bfonta"}

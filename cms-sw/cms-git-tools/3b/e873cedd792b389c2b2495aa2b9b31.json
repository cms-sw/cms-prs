The ```-c``` flag was chosen to replicate what ```git switch -c <branch>``` does. On top, AFAICT from the ```git cherry-pick``` documentation, the ```-c``` flag has no meaning for ```git cherry-pick```.\r\n\r\nTested manually under ```CMSSW_15_1_0_pre5```.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1758636986", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "externals-pending", "tests-pending", "ngt"], "number": 131, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Support the creation of a new branch before cherry-picking.", "updated_at": "1758637092", "user": "bfonta"}

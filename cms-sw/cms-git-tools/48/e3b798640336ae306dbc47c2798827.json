If `git-cms-merge-topic` is used twice with branches A and B, the result is base+A+B. If `git-cms-rebase-topic` is used twice, it creates two separate rebased branches A' = base+A and B' = base+B. This is not obvious or intuitive for most naive use of the command.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I have updated the command to use the current branch as the default new base for the rebase. This means that using it twice will result in base+A+B (A rebased onto base, B rebased onto base+A).\r\n\r\nThe old behavior, if desired, can be restored with the argument `--new-base $CMSSW_VERSION`. (I suspect most people were not relying on this old behavior, so changing the default should be fine.)", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1572004304", "comments": 14, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1571772839", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["comparison-available", "externals-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "47335794c56e8aabed1e6d921851321b98be9b71", "merged_at": "1572004304", "merged_by": "smuzaffar", "number": 106, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "use current branch as default new_base for rebase", "updated_at": "1572004321", "user": "kpedro88"}

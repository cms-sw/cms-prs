We want to/need to decouple\r\nthe SITECONF location from CMSSW location to allow\r\na proper sub-site mechanism and to enable institutes\r\nto provide more than one site/sub-site on a worker\r\nnode, i.e. different than the current \"local\" link.\r\n   We had a discussion on how to best implement\r\nthis quite a while back but couldn't start on it. Matti\r\nand Chris were involved in the discussions.\r\n   Thanks,\r\n- Stephan", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1609744730", "comments": 1, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1609262126", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["externals-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "113d88acacba3df51db05d3d6925968c03790a24", "merged_at": "1609744729", "merged_by": "smuzaffar", "number": 2, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "default setting for the new SITECONFIG_PATH environmental variable", "updated_at": "1609744730", "user": "stlammel"}

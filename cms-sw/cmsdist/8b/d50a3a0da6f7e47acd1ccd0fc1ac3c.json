Fix it for architectures starting with `fc`.\n- GDB bump version to 7.6.1\n- _coral-tool-conf_ needs _bz2lib_ depedency as _pcre_ links to bz2lib. Otherwise we receive SCRAM warning about missing toolfile.\n- Tauolapp 1.3.3 added dependencies for _lhapdf_ and _pythia8_, but such dependencies were never reflected in tauolapp toolfile. Add them.\n", "branch": "IB/CMSSW_7_0_X/devel-gcc48", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1378301390", "comments": 0, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1378298748", "deletions": 1, "labels": [], "merge_commit_sha": "3e0cb0eccf71716b10bd8d3502cadd44c8805a1b", "merged_at": "1378301390", "merged_by": "davidlt", "number": 181, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "[CMSSW_7_0_X][48] Misc. updates", "updated_at": "1378301390", "user": "davidlt"}

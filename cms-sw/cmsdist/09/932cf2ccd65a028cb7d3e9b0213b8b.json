However due to frequent HepForge downtime we would like to be able to install the madgraph prerequisites from CMSSW (https://github.com/cms-sw/genproductions/pull/3712). Collier is built in CMSSW, however it did not have a toolfile, so its directory could not be found by the `scram tool info` command. This PR adds a basic toolfile for collier to rectify this.\r\n\r\nI don't have much experience with toolfiles, so please let me know if something is missing or there is a better solution.", "branch": "IB/CMSSW_14_1_X/master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1716797207", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["externals-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-started", "orp-pending"], "number": 9206, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Add collier toolfile", "updated_at": "1716820451", "user": "Dominic-Stafford"}

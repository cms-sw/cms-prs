Issue tracked here:\r\nhttps://github.com/dmwm/DBS/issues/645\r\n\r\nThis SQLAlchemy version is still expected to be using python byte strings (instead of unicode), so I expect it to solve the \"twophase\" issue and not to cause another one. But we can only be sure once it gets deployed.\r\n\r\nDBS spec files have been updated to use this SQLAlchemy as well.", "branch": "comp_gcc630", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1611212175", "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1611174603", "deletions": 3, "labels": [], "merge_commit_sha": "f8c3bde44dda35b893abc83e2b9b7118dcd695b2", "merged_at": "1611212175", "merged_by": "muhammadimranfarooqi", "number": 6578, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Update DBS specs to SQLAlchemy 1.1.13", "updated_at": "1611212175", "user": "amaltaro"}

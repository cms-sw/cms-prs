These are now separate spec files.\r\n\r\nThis pr includes #6556 as all of those packages would be rebuilt anyway.\r\n\r\nThere are some new dependencies included. One to note is a number of new dependencies on wheel, which others have encountered when bumping setuptools. I just added a build requires in each case.\r\n\r\nFrom discussion in this PR, pip is now updated for python3. While current pip releases nominally support python2, I quickly ran into dependency issues that I didn't want to solve for an obsolete stack. So it is updated for python3 only.\r\n\r\nThe one oddity is with scipy (as commented below). I don't think there is any regression, just a newly known dependency.

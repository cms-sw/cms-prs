Due to a packaging bug on\r\n   Debian, linking against this library causes libunwind.so to get\r\n   a dependency on libatomic_ops.so, which is not at all what we want.\r\n   Fortunately, we don't have to link against that library on x86 or\r\n   ia64 since the library is strictly needed only for platforms with\r\n   poor atomic operation support.  Once the libatomic_ops package is fixed,\r\n   we can re-enable linking against libatomic_ops.\r\n```", "branch": "IB/CMSSW_11_0_X/gcc700", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1562780599", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1562746951", "deletions": 9, "labels": ["comparison-available", "externals-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "518030dc803c92e4d539757c8cb3326169726887", "merged_at": "1562780599", "merged_by": "smuzaffar", "number": 5086, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "updated libunwind to 1.3.1 and drop libatomic_ops deps", "updated_at": "1562780602", "user": "smuzaffar"}

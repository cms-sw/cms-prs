Once I introduced Rucio data-serivce now it was look-up by default. For CERN users it is not a problem since rucio service is visible on CERN network but for off-site users this query hang for long time trying to resolve rucio auth server. This bug fix resolve the issue and remove rucio from a list of default services to look at. I strongly advise to deploy this dasgoclient version asap to cvmfs to avoid users complaining about these types of queries which will hang for long time.", "branch": "IB/CMSSW_10_4_X/gcc700", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1542060349", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["externals-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "number": 4492, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "New dasgoclient version", "updated_at": "1542105232", "user": "vkuznet"}

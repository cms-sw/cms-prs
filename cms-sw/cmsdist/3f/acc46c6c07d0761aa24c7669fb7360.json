Apparently the only difference with the macro @vkuznet already has in place is that this one checks whether dependencies has already been created (if so, do nothing) and it also uses that `_CMSBUILD_BUILD_ENV_` var, which I wonder whether we need it or not?", "branch": "comp_gcc630", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1543307166", "comments": 4, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1542871309", "deletions": 0, "labels": [], "merge_commit_sha": "a7106d0a0d60f461d0f1da25442986e80e5379de", "merged_at": "1543307166", "merged_by": "h4d4", "number": 4521, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Added macro to auto-generate dependencies-setup*", "updated_at": "1543307166", "user": "amaltaro"}

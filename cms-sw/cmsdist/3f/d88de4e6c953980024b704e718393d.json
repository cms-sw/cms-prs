With this change, scram will build multi-arch libs for `MULTIARCH/SKYLAKE` IB/releases but will only build default (`sse3`) set of libraries for other IBs/releases.\r\n\r\nFYI @makortel , @fwyzard \r\n\r\n", "branch": "IB/CMSSW_14_1_X/master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 4, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1713929110", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["externals-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-started", "orp-pending"], "number": 9154, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "for multi-arch set SCRAM_TARGET to auto MULTIARCH/SKYLAKE otherwise to default", "updated_at": "1713929264", "user": "smuzaffar"}

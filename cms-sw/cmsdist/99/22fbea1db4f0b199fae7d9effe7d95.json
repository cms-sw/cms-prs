This can be disabled, but then we will need to provide these ourselves - which means keeping track of LLVM updates (triton needs a very specific commit of LLVM).", "branch": "IB/CMSSW_15_1_X/master", "changed_files": 27, "closed_at": "1756389641", "comments": 24, "commits": 8, "created_at": "1756291073", "deletions": 225, "labels": ["tests-rejected", "externals-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending"], "number": 10044, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "[RFC] Build pytorch with ROCm + python interface ", "updated_at": "1756389641", "user": "iarspider"}

ELF objects are modified in `bin/$SCRAM_ARCH` and `test/$SCRAM_ARCH`, though we don't ship tests with CMSSW by default.\n\nWe might also want to remove `glibc-toolfile.spec` it was mainly needed for bash wrappers.\n", "branch": "IB/CMSSW_7_2_X/next", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1404850903", "comments": 2, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1404850892", "deletions": 111, "labels": [], "merge_commit_sha": "607bcbe8db754022ada53cf7e103192c834d783b", "merged_at": "1404850903", "merged_by": "davidlt", "number": 839, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Post-install step for ELF patching on SCRAM projects", "updated_at": "1404884116", "user": "davidlt"}

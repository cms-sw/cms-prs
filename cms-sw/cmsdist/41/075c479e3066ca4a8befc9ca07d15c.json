This applies to the PhEDEx spec files but also to the lifecycle-dataprovider.\n\nTo build on SLC6, a number of perl modules needed to be recompiled too. These have had a dummy line added to the spec file to trigger a rebuild.\n\nSo, could this request be merged please, and a build made in the comp repository?\n", "branch": "comp", "changed_files": 0, "closed_at": "1378455946", "comments": 3, "commits": 0, "created_at": "1377869464", "deletions": 0, "labels": [], "merge_commit_sha": "4ccbd91acf0c56889a12ff1195345c10573f43fb", "merged_at": "1378455946", "merged_by": "TonyWildish", "number": 174, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Build PhEDEx on SLC6 with https git-access.

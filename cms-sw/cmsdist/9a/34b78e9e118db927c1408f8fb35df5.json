The [new version](https://github.com/cms-DQM/dqmgui_prod/releases/tag/9.9.0) includes a monitoring script for the index size. \r\n  - To do so, I updated the git branch in the `spec` file from (`index128_cc7`) which is dedicated to the CC7 deployment. I'm not sure if it's needed. \r\n- Apply a patch (`dqmgui-index-size.patch`) to increase the limit of `PATHNAMES` (mostly for the `vocms0738` \"offline\" deployment) and `DATASETNAMES` (mostly for the `vocms0731` \"dev\" deployment). The patch was created by a simple `git diff` in the root directory of the `dqmgui_prod` source. I am not sure if it will just work, since the build procedure is not exactly clear to me. Let me know if I need to modify it.\r\n\r\nThis PR is also required for merging this PR: https://github.com/dmwm/deployment/pull/1310\r\n\r\nCC: @syuvivida @tjavaid @antoniovagnerini", "branch": "comp_gcc630", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1712630084", "comments": 4, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1712059069", "deletions": 2, "labels": [], "merge_commit_sha": "07245e501b138b908edf8deafc1e619058580416", "merged_at": "1712630084", "merged_by": "arooshap", "number": 9109, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "[DQM] Bump DQMGUI tag + Apply patch for increasing index limits", "updated_at": "1712630085", "user": "nothingface0"}

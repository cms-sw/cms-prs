Previously this was disabled to avoid getting `rocm/llvm` libs which conflicits with llvm libs from cmssw externals\r\n- Fix `ROOT_INCLUDE_PATH` to have all `INCLUDE` directories. If a tool have multiple include paths then `join=\"1\"` attribute is needed\r\n\r\nFYI @fwyzard ", "branch": "IB/CMSSW_12_4_X/master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1650626119", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["tests-pending", "externals-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending"], "number": 7815, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "updated ROCm tools", "updated_at": "1650626137", "user": "smuzaffar"}

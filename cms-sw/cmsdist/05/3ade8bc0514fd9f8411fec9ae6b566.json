This reduces the bootstrap size to 35MB from 560MB.\n\nNote, this just touches apt.spec and rpm.spec (plus new *-bootstraps.spec) only. So it is safe to merge it in to stable branch of 70X. This is not going to trigger a re-built or any thing (unless one explicitly build apt/rpm or bootstrap-driver).\n\nI have tested it for slc6_amd64_gcc481, slc5_amd64_gcc481, osx108_amd64_gcc481, fc18_armv7hl_gcc481 and slc6_mic_gcc481.\n\nNOTE: I am having problems forking the cmsdist repo. So I have created a branch in cms-sw/cmsdist. Feel free to delete this branch once merge is done.\n", "branch": "IB/CMSSW_7_0_X/stable", "changed_files": 14, "closed_at": "1380308428", "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1380288939", "deletions": 50, "labels": [], "merge_commit_sha": "97bc430d051ae3739613858d76e74b147f28d3ad", "merged_at": "1380308428", "merged_by": "ktf", "number": 199, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "rpm,apt: use new bootstrap-bundle and make gcc a build require", "updated_at": "1380308438", "user": "smuzaffar"}

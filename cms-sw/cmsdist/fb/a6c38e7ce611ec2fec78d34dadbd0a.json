We most likely do not care about side effects in\n`sizeof()` and `typeid()`.\n\nChange library direction from `lib` to `lib64`.\n\nThis change depends on changes in _cmssw-config_ and _cmssw_\nrepositories.\n\nSigned-off-by: David Abdurachmanov David.Abdurachmanov@cern.ch\n", "branch": "IB/CMSSW_7_6_X/next", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1440572212", "comments": 0, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1440572176", "deletions": 37, "labels": [], "merge_commit_sha": "c3ea7006dcc9fa7fcfe6980ad787f97529efc2ee", "merged_at": "1440572212", "merged_by": "davidlt", "number": 1774, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "llvm,llvm-gcc-toolfile,py2-dxr: move to Clang ~3.7.0 RC2", "updated_at": "1440572212", "user": "davidlt"}

However, I did not yet enable that functionality. This would be the next step (purely a change of tool files, where a bunch of lines would be removed and one line added to the cmssw tool file)\r\n\r\nThe tensorflow changes were due to a missing setup tools dependency that they were previously  picking up from py2-numpy.", "branch": "IB/CMSSW_10_1_X/gcc630", "changed_files": 6, "comments": 2, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1521820438", "deletions": 27, "labels": ["externals-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "number": 3874, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Python migration towards pth instead of PATHs", "updated_at": "1521820455", "user": "davidlange6"}

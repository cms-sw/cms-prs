The root cause seems to be that both the \"read\" and \"run\" steps are run in a single job (whereas in standalone Herwig they are run in two different jobs). This leads to issues as two static pointers are made to an object which is deleted and recreated between the steps, removing the static keyword seems to resolve the issue (tested in CMSSW_10_6). Herwig authors agree this seems a reasonable fix, and they plan to include it in future versions of Herwig, this patch resolves the issue in CMSSW in the meantime", "branch": "IB/CMSSW_13_3_X/master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1699089882", "comments": 13, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1698674701", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["tests-approved", "externals-approved", "orp-approved", "generators-approved", "fully-signed"], "merge_commit_sha": "52edfa58c741bf081ecaf9e804d5c20b6d87b970", "merged_at": "1699089882", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "number": 8794, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add fix for segfault in Min Bias", "updated_at": "1699089882", "user": "Dominic-Stafford"}

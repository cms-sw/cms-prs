Previously COMP was setting python2 based paths which were breaking system python3 (used by scram). To avoid this SCRAMV3 dropped `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and `PYTHONPATH` env. Now COMP sets python3 paths which breaks comp python3 ( due to missing LD_LIBRARY_PATH). \r\n\r\nThe PR proposes to use system python3 (instead of COMP) when project env is not set. In case project (CMSSW env is set) then scram can use python3 from cms software stack.\r\n\r\nThe change in SCRAM is https://github.com/cms-sw/SCRAM/commit/e61917ac8b26a2fd0d9f67847aa8271ffe871671", "branch": "IB/CMSSW_12_1_X/master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1629442796", "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1629437058", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["tests-approved", "externals-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "88a99039356f35c1c9085821a376e193ff3967d2", "merged_at": "1629442796", "merged_by": "smuzaffar", "number": 7222, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "[SCRAM] use system python3 when project env is not set", "updated_at": "1629449587", "user": "smuzaffar"}

This inconsistency cause cmssw to fail for `aarch64`. TF `2.12` does not build with `abseil 20230125` so this PR proposes to use `abseil` version `20220623` for cms externals too.\r\n\r\nWe can update `abseil` to `20230125` once we move to TF 2.13 (which uses https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/commit/b971ac5250ea8de900eae9f95e06548d14cd95fe i.e. `lts_2023_01_25` )", "branch": "IB/CMSSW_13_3_X/master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1694457119", "comments": 9, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1694413448", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["tests-approved", "externals-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "bcac4b265dcf304abb57b75e4d55d4eb31eb46d9", "merged_at": "1694457119", "merged_by": "smuzaffar", "number": 8692, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "TF: Use consistent abseil version in cms externals as used by TensorFlow", "updated_at": "1694457141", "user": "smuzaffar"}

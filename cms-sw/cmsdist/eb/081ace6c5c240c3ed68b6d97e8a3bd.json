Details:\r\n\r\n- Update ONNXRuntime from 1.3.0 to 1.6.0. The current fork is at [this branch](https://github.com/riga/onnxruntime/tree/cms/v1.6.0_testing) and could be included to cms_externals/onnxruntime. When 1.6.0 is working properly, the race conditions mentioned in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/32899 should be checked again.\r\n- Add standalone XGBoost library to be used in C++. The Python3 bindings are linked to that version. The legacy Python2 bindings are pinned to an older XGBoost version and thus bring their own library as before.\r\n- Add the [cmsml](https://cmsml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) python package containing useful tools for working with ML in a cms-specific context. These tools are meant to work independently of cmssw, hence the externalization. **Note**: similar yet older versions of some of the tools are currently living in PhysicsTools/TensorFlow/python and should be removed (or properly deprecated) (https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/32942).\r\n- Add [`onnxmltools`](https://pypi.org/project/onnxmltools) which contains several converters to onnx model format. I only added the Python3 tools as they dropped Python2 quite a while ago, and we should have the latest version available to support more models.\r\n- Minor version updates of other ml related software and add the luigi/law workflow tools (plus 2 dependencies) as they are used in some groups.\r\n\r\nI tested with workflow 23424.0 (TTbar_13+2026D49PU): `runTheMatrix.py -w upgrade -l 23424.0`.\r\n\r\n@mialiu149", "branch": "IB/CMSSW_11_3_X/master", "changed_files": 22, "closed_at": "1613589268", "comments": 44, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1613409436", "deletions": 20, "labels": ["allow-riga", "externals-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "cc7078a7fc728e7cba43c41ba962bc45abbabb62", "merged_at": "1613589268", "merged_by": "smuzaffar", "number": 6649, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Update ML related software", "updated_at": "1613641525", "user": "riga"}

While probably this is a sign that a different approach is needed to cache these long to compute results, this PR speeds this calculation up.\r\n\r\nTwo changes are proposed\r\n1) to use the optimization flags suggested by openloops documentation for openloops. Note that adding the last possible -02 flag makes compilation go forever.\r\n2) to improve one of the hotspots in openloops for the benchmark workflow.\r\n\r\nThere are other clear optimizations to make.

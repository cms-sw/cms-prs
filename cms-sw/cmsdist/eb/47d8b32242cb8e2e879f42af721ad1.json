This allows to properly generate the toolfiles using the package informaton atbuild time instead of setting env or doing sed/grep in `%post` section. This is done by adding all tools in a single file and then expanding that file with in the actual toolfile or tool-conf\r\n\r\n- Support added to build the stack without optional tools e.g. on Risc-V we do not have rocm/cuda. So using new feature of [pkgtools](https://github.com/cms-sw/pkgtools/pull/209) , now we should be able to build the external software tool stack for Risc-V. \r\n\r\n- cpu_features update to version 0.9.0 which has risc-v support/fixes", "branch": "IB/CMSSW_14_1_X/master", "changed_files": 35, "closed_at": "1717693329", "comments": 21, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1717391737", "deletions": 125, "labels": ["tests-rejected", "externals-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "requires-external"], "merge_commit_sha": "741a7f8a376979d089bd8dfb105351e6efdbc303", "merged_at": "1717693329", "merged_by": "smuzaffar", "number": 9218, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 6, "state": "closed", "title": "scram tool clean; support for building stack without an option tool", "updated_at": "1717693348", "user": "smuzaffar"}

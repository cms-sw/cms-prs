Thanks to Moritz Kreutzer and\r\n  Stadik for reporting the issue.\r\n- Added support for ELEMENTAL to the MPI handle comparison functions\r\n  in the mpi_f08 module.  Thanks to Salvatore Filippone for raising\r\n  the issue.\r\n- Minor datatype performance improvements in the CUDA-based code paths.\r\n- Fix MPI_ALLTOALLV when used with MPI_IN_PLACE.\r\n- Fix MPI_BOTTOM handling for non-blocking collectives.  Thanks to\r\n  Lisandro Dalcin for reporting the problem.\r\n- Enable OPAL memory hooks by default for UCX.\r\n- Many compiler warnings fixes, particularly for newer versions of\r\n  GCC.\r\n- Fix intercommunicator overflow with large payload collectives.  Also\r\n  fixed MPI_REDUCE_SCATTER_BLOCK for similar issues with large payload\r\n  collectives.\r\n- Back-port ROMIO 3.3 fix to use stat64() instead of stat() on GPFS.\r\n- Fixed several non-blocking MPI collectives to not round fractions\r\n  based on float precision.\r\n- Fix compile failure for --enable-heterogeneous.  Also updated the\r\n  README to clarify that --enable-heterogeneous is functional, but\r\n  still not recomended for most environments.\r\n- Minor fixes to OMPIO, including:\r\n  - Fixing the open behavior of shared memory shared file pointers.\r\n    Thanks to Axel Huebl for reporting the issue\r\n  - Fixes to clean up lockfiles when closing files.  Thanks to Eric\r\n    Chamberland for reporting the issue.\r\n- Update LSF configure failure output to be more clear (e.g., on RHEL\r\n  platforms).\r\n- Update if_[in|ex]clude behavior in btl_tcp and oob_tcp to select\r\n  *all* interfaces that fall within the specified subnet range.", "branch": "IB/CMSSW_12_4_X/master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1648753913", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["tests-approved", "externals-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending"], "number": 7738, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Update OpenMPI to version 4.1.3", "updated_at": "1648792698", "user": "fwyzard"}

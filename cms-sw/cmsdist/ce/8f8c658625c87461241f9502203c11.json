It consists of a numactl program to run other programs with a specific NUMA policy and a libnuma shared library (\"NUMA API\") to set NUMA policy in applications.\r\nSee https://github.com/numactl/numactl/blob/v2.0.14/README.md for more information.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Add libpciaccess, a generic PCI access library\r\n\r\nlibpciaccess is a generic PCI access library originally developed for the Xorg project; it is now used by various other projects, for example the hwloc library developed by the OpenMPI project.\r\n\r\nThe upstream git repository is at https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libpciaccess\r\n\r\nTo avoid the dependency on the \"xorg-macros\" autotool package, the CMSDIST package for libpciaccess is based on the Debian package (where the autogen step has already been performed) instead of the upstream git sources.", "branch": "IB/CMSSW_11_3_X/master", "changed_files": 13, "closed_at": "1610343096", "comments": 59, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1608759885", "deletions": 13, "labels": ["externals-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "e9ba9726ac62f79ec0a0631231c18a5dade4a20b", "merged_at": "1610343096", "merged_by": "smuzaffar", "number": 6523, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "Update OpenMPI to 4.1.0, and add extra support libraries", "updated_at": "1610343096", "user": "fwyzard"}

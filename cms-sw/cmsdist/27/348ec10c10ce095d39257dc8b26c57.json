It was broken with SCRAM V3. This should be fixed now.\r\n- `scram b disable-biglib` is broken with SCRAMV3. Disabling the biglib was commenting the biglib paths using `#` in the `config/Self.xml` file. `#` was a valid comment character for SCRSM V2 but as SCRAM V3 uses proper xml parser, so this was not a valid comment. BuildRules are fixed to use proper `<!--  -->` comment", "branch": "IB/CMSSW_12_0_X/master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1620195966", "comments": 7, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1620190473", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["externals-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "tests-rejected"], "merge_commit_sha": "da8aa6332661c96daf1d1b768727a18538283747", "merged_at": "1620195965", "merged_by": "smuzaffar", "number": 6874, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "[SCRAM] Fix scram build -j without N option bug", "updated_at": "1620203430", "user": "smuzaffar"}

This build has the C++ evaluator and python2 bindings only.

Is there anywhere else I have to add the site package since I am not pip installing in cmsdist? For reference, a sufficient python2 test would be:\r\n```python\r\nimport correctionlib._core as cc\r\ncs = cc.CorrectionSet.from_file(\"/cvmfs/cms.cern.ch/rsync/cms-nanoAOD/jsonpog-integration/POG/EGM/2017_UL/photon.json.gz\")\r\ncs[\"UL-Photon-ID-SF\"].evaluate(\"2017\", \"sf\", \"Loose\", 1.2, 25.3)\r\n```\r\n\r\nCloses #7510 ", "branch": "IB/CMSSW_10_6_X/gcc700", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1639777079", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["tests-pending", "externals-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending"], "number": 7523, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Correctionlib C++ and python2 binding for 10_6_X", "updated_at": "1639777102", "user": "nsmith-"}

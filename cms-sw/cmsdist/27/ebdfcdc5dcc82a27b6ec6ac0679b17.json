This build has the C++ evaluator and python2 bindings only. A subset of the high-level wrapper could be backported as well, in principle.\r\n\r\nTODO: in my test area, the python2 binding is not available until I run the corresponding `...build/slc7_amd64_gcc700/external/correctionlib/2.1.0-3822e3561f9af87ea18bc53317ea8ebf/etc/profile.d/init.sh`. Is there anywhere else I have to add the site package since I am not pip installing in cmsdist? For reference, a sufficient python2 test would be:\r\n```python\r\nimport correctionlib._core as cc\r\ncs = cc.CorrectionSet.from_file(\"/cvmfs/cms.cern.ch/rsync/cms-nanoAOD/jsonpog-integration/POG/EGM/2017_UL/photon.json.gz\")\r\ncs[\"UL-Photon-ID-SF\"].evaluate(\"2017\", \"sf\", \"Loose\", 1.2, 25.3)\r\n```\r\n\r\nCloses #7510 ", "branch": "IB/CMSSW_10_6_X/gcc700", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1641817523", "comments": 7, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1639777079", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["tests-approved", "externals-approved", "orp-approved", "fully-signed", "requires-external"], "merge_commit_sha": "468b0c920471766c3dbbb4277fe994b667193f1e", "merged_at": "1641817523", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "number": 7523, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "[10.6.X] Correctionlib C++ and python2 binding", "updated_at": "1641817523", "user": "nsmith-"}

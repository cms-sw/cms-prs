For this purpose, I have adjusted the MG5_aMC@NLO standard configuration file. However, this standalone mode will not be used by default, it is only a by-product.\n", "branch": "IB/CMSSW_7_5_X/stable", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1435221081", "comments": 24, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1433777404", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["tests-pending"], "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 1614, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "Add MadGraph5_aMC@NLO as external package", "updated_at": "1435307060", "user": "mharrend"}

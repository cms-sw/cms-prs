We just need to pull in a single header file ([this one](https://github.com/thesps/conifer/blob/master/conifer/backends/cpp/include/conifer.h)).\r\n\r\nThis is my first time adding an external, so to check: the header file itself does `#include \"nlohmann/json.hpp\"`, which is already an external. Do I need to add a requirement on `json`?", "branch": "IB/CMSSW_13_3_X/master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1698060627", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["tests-pending", "externals-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending"], "number": 8780, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Add conifer external", "updated_at": "1698060648", "user": "thesps"}

Bazel version 0.10.0 works with latest java but tensorflow 1.3.0 does not build with it (because of some deprecated functionality in bazel). So we propose to move to tensorflow 1.5.0.", "branch": "IB/CMSSW_10_1_X/gcc630", "changed_files": 9, "comments": 14, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1517954235", "deletions": 104, "labels": ["externals-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-rejected"], "number": 3717, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "updated bazel 0.10.0; tensorflow 1.5.0", "updated_at": "1518042317", "user": "smuzaffar"}

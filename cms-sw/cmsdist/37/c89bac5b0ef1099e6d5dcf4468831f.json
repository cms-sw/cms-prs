Backport #6681 #6680\r\n_________________________________\r\nIt is needed by an SMP analysis that doesn't have a CADI line yet but it's near completion. These Sherpa samples will be added as another theory prediction to compare to the particle-level W(munu)+jets differential cross sections in this analysis (within the SMP PAG). The analysts (Andrew Wisecarver et al) confirmed that they are not planning on moving to the UltraLegacy datasets, so the Legacy samples are what they are after.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "IB/CMSSW_7_1_X/stable", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1614674921", "comments": 18, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1614266592", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["allow-SiewYan", "externals-pending", "generators-approved", "orp-approved", "pending-signatures", "tests-rejected"], "merge_commit_sha": "107163ad6db83a92c6e3722e583fbca31ca8b6ce", "merged_at": "1614674921", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "number": 6682, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "[7_1_X] upgrade sherpa to 2.2.11", "updated_at": "1614674921", "user": "SiewYan"}

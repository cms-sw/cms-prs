This was done to make sure we only use locally build externals tools. Now with multi-arch builds, we should also drop externals/arch/bin/microarch, externals/arch/lib/microarch  path from the release. This makes sure and additional libs/binaries from these dirs are not in PATH/LD_LIBRARY_PATH during PR tests.", "branch": "IB/CMSSW_15_0_X/master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1734510141", "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1734462208", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["externals-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-started", "orp-pending", "requires-external"], "merge_commit_sha": "dfef16ac095b744b45ee7ac4e732b80272c5cb91", "merged_at": "1734510141", "merged_by": "smuzaffar", "number": 9584, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "[BuildRules] For PR test: drop additional microarch release/externals lib/bindirs", "updated_at": "1734510167", "user": "smuzaffar"}

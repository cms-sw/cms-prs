Looks like Sherpa is calling `setenv` ( see https://github.com/cms-sw/cmsdist/pull/10058#issuecomment-3255956279 ). The `setenv` call is made [here]( https://gitlab.com/sherpa-team/sherpa/-/blob/v2.2.15/ATOOLS/Org/Run_Parameter.C?ref_type=tags#L234-237) which has been removed in newer sherpa versions (v3.0.0 and above) via https://gitlab.com/sherpa-team/sherpa/-/commit/6ead62d7a2758612f8965fb5b61df8c012cf9cae change. This PR proposes to include this change in our sherpa version to avoid `setenv` calls.\r\n\r\n@cms-sw/generators-l2 , can you please review this change ? May be we can move to sherpa v3?", "branch": "IB/CMSSW_16_0_X/master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 15, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1757839324", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["tests-approved", "generators-approved", "externals-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending"], "number": 10073, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[Sherpa]Apply the upstream patch to avoid setting env", "updated_at": "1758635943", "user": "smuzaffar"}

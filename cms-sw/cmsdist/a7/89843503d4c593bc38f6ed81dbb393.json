Sorting of such list will take a minute and not really necessary. While for other DAS queries, such as site for given dataset, it is required since users want to see final set of sites, while results shows all possible replicas. As compromise I made unique flag and made it optional. By default sorting/uniq is disabled to provide ability to look-up results as fast as possible.", "branch": "IB/CMSSW_9_1_X/gcc530", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1490127446", "comments": 10, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1489500902", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["externals-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "0cb54453810e0f61286af4c3d20ed46cf41b42b0", "merged_at": "1490127446", "merged_by": "smuzaffar", "number": 2898, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "To avoid latency disable uniq sorting by default and made it optional", "updated_at": "1490130595", "user": "vkuznet"}

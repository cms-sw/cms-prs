This is my opinion, i tested it and no problem occurred. However, i may have overlooked something, so please add your feedback if you think that those `.patch` files are still needed!\r\n\r\n\r\nfyi: @belforte ", "branch": "comp_gcc630", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1646650876", "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1646257013", "deletions": 883, "labels": [], "merge_commit_sha": "df47b2319579191da5d4d9a36ae3c27297b34cd5", "merged_at": "1646650875", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "number": 7661, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "crab. py3-only specfiles, removing unused .patch files.", "updated_at": "1646650877", "user": "mapellidario"}

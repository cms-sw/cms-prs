The Triton repository has been refactored into separate components, so the external is renamed to `triton-inference-client`.\r\n\r\nIn the process of refactoring, access to some helper functions was lost, so these are installed by hand in the spec file. This should be fixed in an upcoming version of Triton. (Hopefully the various CMake issues currently solved in the spec file will also be addressed.)\r\n\r\nThe Triton updates require a newer version of CMake, so that is done here as well.\r\n\r\nThis PR requires an associated CMSSW PR (to be submitted simultaneously) to compile: https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/34508", "branch": "IB/CMSSW_12_0_X/master", "changed_files": 8, "closed_at": "1626703168", "comments": 18, "commits": 8, "created_at": "1626376799", "deletions": 98, "labels": ["externals-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "requires-external", "tests-rejected"], "merge_commit_sha": "61af3a1e8e769c86b3452eba31ef8f8b46ea1daa", "merged_at": "1626703168", "merged_by": "smuzaffar", "number": 7142, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "Update Triton to v2.11", "updated_at": "1626703168", "user": "kpedro88"}

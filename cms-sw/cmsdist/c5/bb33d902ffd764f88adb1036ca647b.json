This removes terminfo database from `./share` path and prevents having RPM with hard links.\n- Use 8.33 _pcre_ on Fedora to be compatible with system. Warnings were produced by linker while compiling CMSSW about possible conflicts. \n", "branch": "IB/CMSSW_7_0_X/devel-gcc48", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1377058286", "comments": 0, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1377030130", "deletions": 8, "labels": [], "merge_commit_sha": "8cd1926a9eaacce6d022143a5b3fe519616c9945", "merged_at": "1377058286", "merged_by": "davidlt", "number": 163, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "[CMSSW_7_0_X][48][ARM] Misc. fixes", "updated_at": "1377058287", "user": "davidlt"}

Originally I compiled GMP and MPFR statically, then had\nthem as build time only dependency. The patch resolves Clang and ICC\nbuild errors correctly.\n\nThere is already a partial fix on ICC:\n\n```\n250dbe3a8d1df22f26eb625351c62d99ec629b02\n```\n\nMakes GMP and MPFR as 'Requires:' in CGAL. Then adds those dependencies\nin CGAL toolfile.\n\nSigned-off-by: David Abdurachmanov David.Abdurachmanov@cern.ch\n", "branch": "IB/CMSSW_7_3_X/stable", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1415455256", "comments": 0, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1415455247", "deletions": 1, "labels": [], "merge_commit_sha": "f2007daf367715c4cdd624145beef886817b8d6d", "merged_at": "1415455256", "merged_by": "davidlt", "number": 1172, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "cgal,cgal-toolfile: add dependency on gmp-static and mpfr-static", "updated_at": "1415455256", "user": "davidlt"}

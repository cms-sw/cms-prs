One side effect of this is that it sets `PATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` of `bootstrap-bundle` package. Libraries (e.g openssl , xml2, zma etc) and binaries from these paths can be picked up by the up stream packages and can override system libs. For example , if one wants to use `openssl` from system then `openssl` library from bootstrap bundle will hide it.\r\n\r\nThe change in rpm-preamble.file does not re-build any thing. It will be only use when a package (for some other reason) needs a rebuilt. In orde rto test this fully, I have changed gcc.spec to re-build all packages to see if this has any side effects,", "branch": "IB/CMSSW_11_2_X/master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1605515351", "comments": 14, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1605278083", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["comparison-available", "externals-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "7bfff4fd45eaf89d8a50206f11bd34f4764d1797", "merged_at": "1605515351", "merged_by": "smuzaffar", "number": 6420, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Remove bootstrap bin and lib paths during the build stage", "updated_at": "1605529275", "user": "smuzaffar"}

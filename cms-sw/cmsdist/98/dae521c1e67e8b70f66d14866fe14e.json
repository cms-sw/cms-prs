The externals and CMSSW packages can declare `use name=\"mpi\"` to use the generic tool. Updating the tool to use MPICH instead of Open MPI automatically updates all externals and packages.\r\n\r\nNote: this can also be used within CMSSW to rebuild the MPI-related packages using MPICH instead of Open MPI. In this case, the externals are not affected.", "branch": "IB/CMSSW_15_1_X/master", "changed_files": 11, "comments": 20, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1746876057", "deletions": 10, "labels": ["hold", "externals-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-started", "orp-pending"], "number": 9845, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Add MPICH v4.3 and a generic MPI tool", "updated_at": "1747059269", "user": "fwyzard"}

It is needed for the integration of the [DeepAK8](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/DeepAKXTagging) tagger into CMSSW. \r\n\r\nThis includes both the C and C++ APIs. MXNet is built in prediction-only mode (`MXNET_PREDICT_ONLY=1`) here, as so far we only intend to use it for the evaluation of the neural networks, not for training (which is typically done on a GPU w/ the python API). By compiling in the prediction-only mode, MXNet is also set to run in [Native Engine](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/faq/env_var.html#engine-type) mode such that it runs in the master thread instead of creating its own thread pool.", "branch": "IB/CMSSW_10_2_X/gcc630", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1531331257", "comments": 26, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1530623710", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["externals-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "e10e5055e58f782080c063009b7df6f9a1c1a0d6", "merged_at": "1531331257", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "number": 4167, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add MXNet prediction tool", "updated_at": "1531331257", "user": "hqucms"}

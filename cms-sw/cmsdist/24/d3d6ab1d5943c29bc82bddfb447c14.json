Thanks to Pierre Neyron.\r\n* Update NVLink bandwidth and CUDA capabilities up to NVIDIA Blackwell.\r\n* Fix some NUMA syscalls on Linux for platforms with old libc headers.\r\n* Some minor fixes in distances.", "branch": "IB/CMSSW_15_0_X/master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 10, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1739892887", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["tests-approved", "externals-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "backport-ok"], "number": 9697, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Update hwloc to version 2.12.0 [15.0.x]", "updated_at": "1740037407", "user": "fwyzard"}

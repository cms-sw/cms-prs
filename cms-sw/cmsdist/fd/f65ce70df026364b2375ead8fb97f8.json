Workqueue was already taken as a PyPI package name, so WMCore code was updated to use `global-workqueue` to reference the set of code dependencies and build a `global-workqueue` pypi package.\r\n\r\nThis will not impact the name of the `workqueue` RPM. It will stay the same. The changes proposed in this PR just allow us to build both the RPM and PyPI based packages using the `global-workqueue` name.

Instead, it uses the CMakeLists.txt for the client package, which is the only part that is needed for CMSSW.\r\n* A few of the tweaks to the CMake setup, currently implemented using `sed`, will hopefully be imported to the official repository at some point (work in progress).\r\n* the curl version is upgraded because of a missing def in the old version, needed by Triton.", "branch": "IB/CMSSW_11_2_X/master", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1590858683", "comments": 46, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1590510206", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["comparison-available", "externals-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "tests-rejected"], "merge_commit_sha": "98878e0c822f531e11c65bf5ed6b8825e434da69", "merged_at": "1590858683", "merged_by": "smuzaffar", "number": 5868, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "Triton inference server", "updated_at": "1590858695", "user": "kpedro88"}

But this causes \"dlclose\" to be ignored for affected DSOs; if your program relies on reinitialization of a DSO via \"dlclose\" and \"dlopen\", you can use `-fno-gnu-unique`.\r\n\r\nSince CMSSW loads plugins using `RTLD_GLOBAL`, not `RTLD_LOCAL`, we could check the impact of disabling the GNU unique extension, that does not seem to be supported by clang.", "branch": "IB/CMSSW_13_1_X/master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 10, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1678780199", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["tests-approved", "externals-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending"], "number": 8381, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[do not merge] Disable the use of GNU unique symbols", "updated_at": "1678879305", "user": "fwyzard"}

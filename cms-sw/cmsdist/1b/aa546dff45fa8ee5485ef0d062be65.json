That said, the number of changes in the REST are not so relevant, and I don't expect to find any major issue (I will regret saying this..):\n- return the `DagmanHoldReason` to the client\n- do not consider jobs in 'cooloff' during resubmit\n- add a new API (`updateschedd`) to allow binding schedd on the TW\n- changes for the `dryrun` features (new DB column and SQL queries to support it)\n- Use cached external configuration when git is down\n- Check that only CRAB3 operators can delete filemetadata\n- Other 'random' refactorings and bugfixes\n\nComplete list: https://github.com/dmwm/CRABServer/commits/master/src/python/CRABInterface\n", "branch": "comp_gcc481", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1426864950", "comments": 0, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1426781091", "deletions": 20, "labels": ["tests-pending"], "number": 1456, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "CRAB3 3.3.15 first release candidate", "updated_at": "1426864950", "user": "mmascher"}

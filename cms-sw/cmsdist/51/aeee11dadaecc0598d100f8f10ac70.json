This PR updates go compiler to version 1.13.8 and adjust exporters spec accordingly. Please note that tfaas still fails with new Go compiler due to outdated list of dependencies of Go stack in TensorFlow. Therefore it should be removed from comp.spec and from repository for time being until I found a resolution.", "branch": "comp_gcc630", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1584204752", "comments": 13, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1584122931", "deletions": 6, "labels": [], "merge_commit_sha": "6c37d3359f11c2fe5893a1a81047968d26d57429", "merged_at": "1584204752", "merged_by": "muhammadimranfarooqi", "number": 5643, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "New go version", "updated_at": "1584204752", "user": "vkuznet"}

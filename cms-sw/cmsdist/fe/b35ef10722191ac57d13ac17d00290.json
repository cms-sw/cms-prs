When the file is\r\ncreated by another user, subsequent installations may fail due to\r\npermission errors.\r\n\r\nTo avoid this, explicitly create the required directory before the\r\ninstallation and clean it up afterward. This ensures the installer\r\ncan write logs safely in multi-user build environments.\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n- https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/whats-new-and-important-in-cuda-toolkit-13-0/#:~:text=The%20CUDA%20Toolkit%2013.0%20release%20introduces%20support,removes%20support%20for%20ICC%20and%20MSVC%202017\r\n- Known installer issue with cuda-installer.log\r\n  https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/change-the-path-of-install-log-when-installing-cuda-toolkit/183179", "branch": "IB/CMSSW_16_0_X/g14", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1766049894", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["tests-pending", "externals-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending"], "number": 10257, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": " For gcc15 added cuda 13.1.0 as this release introduces support for G", "updated_at": "1766049914", "user": "raoatifshad"}

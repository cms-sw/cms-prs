As mentioned https://github.com/boostorg/filesystem/issues/172 , if boost is built on a newer kernel then `statx()` will fail if run on an older kernel. We have seen such issues with our ARM machines where one machine has kernel `4.18` and other is `4.5` . The `boost-1.75.0-disable-statx` patch disable the `statx()` checks and should work for both old and new kernels.", "branch": "IB/CMSSW_11_3_X/master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1615924329", "comments": 34, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1614852308", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["externals-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "8e379ad284f27b636908cd39f55128a34660d7e6", "merged_at": "1615924329", "merged_by": "smuzaffar", "number": 6699, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Boost - update to 1.75.0", "updated_at": "1615924620", "user": "smuzaffar"}

This has been corrected, with separate second- and third-order options now available for matrix elements and showers. In practice the difference between second- and third-order running is minor, and furthermore first-order is default throughout.\r\n\r\nAlso discussed in today's GEN meeting: https://indico.cern.ch/event/1293969/contributions/5438463/attachments/2668515/4624955/GEN%20Meeting%20190623%20v2.pdf#page=16\r\n\r\nThe changes in our custom 8.306 were taken from the later Pythia versions, so they are all included.\r\n\r\n@cms-sw/generators-l2 @amsimone FYI\r\n\r\n@smrenna Would it be possible to get the patch fixing the alpha_s bug, so that we could consider a backport to 10_6 (https://github.com/cms-externals/pythia8/tree/cms/240)?", "branch": "IB/CMSSW_13_2_X/master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 13, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1687177604", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["externals-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-started", "orp-pending", "requires-external"], "number": 8552, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Update Pythia to 8.309", "updated_at": "1687239691", "user": "mseidel42"}

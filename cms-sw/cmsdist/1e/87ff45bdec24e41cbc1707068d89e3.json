This change does the following\r\n- build normal DD4Hep with out Geant4\r\n- Build DDG4 part of DD4Hep as static libraries. This is done to avoid loading of Geant4 shared libraries via DDG4.so if this end up as dependency on big simulation plugin in CMSSW (which only links against static geant4).\r\n- Enabled building of DDCMS example. In past we had added a dd4hep-cms tool but the libDDCMS.so was not actually build. One has to explicitly build examples/DDCMS to get it generated.\r\n\r\nThis should resolve https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/26242\r\nFYI @ianna ", "branch": "IB/CMSSW_10_6_X/gcc700", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 11, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1553773585", "deletions": 33, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "externals-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "number": 4820, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "enable geant4 and example/ddcms for dd4hep", "updated_at": "1553900702", "user": "smuzaffar"}

In this mode, functions marked as ALPAKA_FN_ACC are marked as `__device__` functions, and are compiled only for the corresponding GPU device back-ends.\r\n\r\nCurrently, functions marked as ALPAKA_FN_ACC are marked as `__host__ __device__` functions, and may be compiled for both device and host back-ends. The latter leads to linker errors in kernels that use device symbols like `threadIdx`, `blockIdx`, _etc_. that are compiled for the ROCm back-end.", "branch": "IB/CMSSW_14_1_X/master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1712325191", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["externals-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-started", "orp-pending"], "number": 9121, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Build alpaka code in GPU-only mode", "updated_at": "1712325309", "user": "fwyzard"}

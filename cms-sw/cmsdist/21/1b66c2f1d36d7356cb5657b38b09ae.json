In this mode, functions marked as ALPAKA_FN_ACC are marked as `__device__` functions, and are compiled only for the corresponding GPU device back-ends.\r\n\r\nCurrently, functions marked as ALPAKA_FN_ACC are marked as `__host__ __device__` functions, and may be compiled for both device and host back-ends. The latter leads to linker errors in kernels that use device symbols like `threadIdx`, `blockIdx`, _etc_. that are compiled for the ROCm back-end.", "branch": "IB/CMSSW_14_1_X/master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1712604340", "comments": 17, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1712325191", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["tests-rejected", "externals-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "f4a1a43c317621a804868c468afc9249e0c8bedb", "merged_at": "1712604340", "merged_by": "smuzaffar", "number": 9121, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Build alpaka code in GPU-only mode", "updated_at": "1712604342", "user": "fwyzard"}

In addition to that resolves some asserts in Clang while compiling CMSSW. Same PR (#1220) was merged into DEVEL IBs ~2 months ago. Plain CMSSW now fully compiles and links with Clang.\n\nWe will probably again update Clang soonish as 3.6 RC1 is now released, but not tested with CMSSW.\n\n@ktf @davidlange6\n", "branch": "IB/CMSSW_7_4_X/stable", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1422346861", "comments": 1, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1421948328", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "617a38837d42910c33cbdf73cb2c4268f52c60e4", "merged_at": "1422346861", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 1320, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Update LLVM/Clang to pre-3.6", "updated_at": "1422346861", "user": "davidlt"}

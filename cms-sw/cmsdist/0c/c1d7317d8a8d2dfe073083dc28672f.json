Ideally clang-tidy should read the `llvm/bin/clang++.cfg` to get extra arguments. I will open a issue with llvm to check why clang-tidy is not respecting `llvm/bin/clang++.cfg`", "branch": "IB/CMSSW_15_1_X/master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 4, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1748593706", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["externals-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-started", "orp-pending"], "number": 9900, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "BuildRules: Explicitly add gcc-toolchain in compile_commands.json", "updated_at": "1748593746", "user": "smuzaffar"}

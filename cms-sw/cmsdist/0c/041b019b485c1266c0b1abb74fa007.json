But it seems reqmon is updated with that.\nPatch0: reqmon-erl-views\nAlso I was wondering this can be updated as soon as possible on testbed. Global run starts 27th and this need to be validated before that. It doesn't have to be in the production on that day though. Could you also delete all the data in tier0_wmstats in the testbed and production right before Global run starts?\n@hufnagel, Dirk, please confirm that decision (deleting all the data from tier0_wmstats)\n\nThanks, \nSeangchan\n", "branch": "comp_gcc481", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1414195270", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1413686151", "deletions": 1, "labels": [], "number": 1130, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "upgrade t0_reqmon to 1.0.1.pre1", "updated_at": "1414195270", "user": "ticoann"}

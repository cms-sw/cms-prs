The latter leads to linker errors in kernels that use device symbols like `threadIdx`, `blockIdx`, _etc_. that are compiled for the ROCm back-end.\r\n\r\nBackport #9121 to CMSSW 14.0.x for data taking.", "branch": "IB/CMSSW_14_0_X/master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1712478672", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["tests-pending", "externals-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "backport"], "number": 9125, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Build alpaka code in GPU-only mode [14.0.x]", "updated_at": "1712478727", "user": "fwyzard"}

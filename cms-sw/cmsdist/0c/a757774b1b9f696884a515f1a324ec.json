Users might need to set appropriate SQLPATH and TNS_ADMIN environment variables themselves. In addition to that update Oracle Instant Client version to 12.1.0.2.0. One common version for macOS (x86_64) and Linux (x86_64, ppc64le, ppc64). Note, there is still no release for ARMv8 64-bit/ARM64/AArch64. At the same time update cx_Oracle Python package to the latest version.\n", "branch": "IB/CMSSW_8_1_X/gcc530", "changed_files": 9, "closed_at": "1468937967", "comments": 2, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1468924222", "deletions": 453, "labels": ["externals-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "0bec3d6e5850cf9e32e92b4f20403e41ffcfc8de", "merged_at": "1468937967", "merged_by": "davidlt", "number": 2400, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Oracle environment removal and Oracle related packages update", "updated_at": "1468937967", "user": "davidlt"}

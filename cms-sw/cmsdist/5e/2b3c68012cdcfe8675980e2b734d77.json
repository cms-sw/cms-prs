This feature will become available in the future. But since both the QCD helicity shower and the EW shower require polarised particles, matrix elements can be used to select helicities for the Born process.\r\nBorn-level helicity selection can be enabled by setting the modeMECs and the respective maxMECs switches (see below) to 0. Additionally, Vincia:MEPlugin must be set to a valid plugin library. By default, these plugins are not built and can be enabled with ./configure --enable-mg5mes.\r\n\r\nList of MEs currently shipping with Pythia can be found here: https://gitlab.com/Pythia8/releases/-/tree/master/plugins/mg5mes", "branch": "IB/CMSSW_12_5_X/master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1656417382", "comments": 14, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1655905547", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["tests-approved", "externals-approved", "generators-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "6924956bbaaf147a8e02d9abde2ad2ed443c166a", "merged_at": "1656417382", "merged_by": "smuzaffar", "number": 7952, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "[Pythia8] Enable Vincia ME corrections", "updated_at": "1656417383", "user": "mseidel42"}

The latter is provided by CERN and automatically synchronizes the `tnsnames.ora` from AFS/EOS in the localhost (every hour). That said, we'd have to install that RPM via puppet on all the CMSWEB backends (are the frontends talking to oracle somehow?), on every vocms/production host and maybe on CRAB TaskWorker as well(?)\r\n\r\nOn your private CERN openstack VM, you can install this RPM as:\r\n```\r\nsudo yum install oracle-instantclient-tnsnames.ora --enablerepo={cernonly,cernonly-testing}\r\n```\r\n\r\n@smuzaffar @mrodozov I'm not sure this is the best way to address this issue.\r\n@h4d4 you might have concerns as well.", "branch": "comp_gcc630", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1557467281", "comments": 16, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1555417598", "deletions": 11685, "labels": [], "merge_commit_sha": "fb1b9d3ccf33fee14df74a396ce64be150a098bc", "merged_at": "1557467281", "merged_by": "h4d4", "number": 4885, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "Set TNS_ADMIN env var to /etc, requires additional RPM", "updated_at": "1557467281", "user": "amaltaro"}

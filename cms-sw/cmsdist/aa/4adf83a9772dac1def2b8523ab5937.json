Grid packs makes use of `gsl-config` and fails ( see https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/42716 for datails). This PR should fix the old release cycles and already built releases as it adds a `SCRAM` site based runtime hook to add CMS distributed `gsl/bin` in to PATH.", "branch": "IB/CMSSW_13_3_X/master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1695298841", "comments": 4, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1695276738", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["externals-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-started", "orp-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "a90d5f795459f135c6de21799d3b1eaeb2550057", "merged_at": "1695298841", "merged_by": "smuzaffar", "number": 8712, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "[cms-common] Added scram site runtime hook to add gsl/bin in to PATH", "updated_at": "1695298857", "user": "smuzaffar"}

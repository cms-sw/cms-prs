This was done to avoid failures on `slc6` where we do not have system `python3` ( needed by SCRAM V3). This change proposes to use [SCRAM V3](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw-osenv/commit/cc61d5356f60a5a3a56a32a738fb1958f7836db7) for containers where python3 is installed in the container (e.g. el7 and above). \r\n\r\nThis change should allow CMS Connect jobs to use `cmssw-el7/el8` for CMSSW projects which use SCRAM V3. Note that currently CMS Connect sources some el9 based script ( /cvmfs/oasis.opensciencegrid.org/mis/osg-wn-client/23-main/23.240627-1/el9-x86_64/setup.sh ) before starting `cmssw-el7/el8`. This adds some extra binary Perl modules in PERL5LIB which breaks PERL [a] within the container. As SCRAM V2 is perl based, so scram commands fail in such an environment. \r\n\r\nCorrect fix for CMS Connect jobs should be to unset the `PERL5LIB` env before starting  `cmssw-elX` (where X is not 9)\r\n\r\n[a]\r\n```\r\n> source /cvmfs/oasis.opensciencegrid.org/mis/osg-wn-client/23-main/23.240805-1/el9-x86_64/setup.sh\r\n> cmssw-el8 -- perl -e 'use Cwd'\r\nCan't load '/cvmfs/oasis.opensciencegrid.org/mis/osg-wn-client/23-main/23.240805-1/el9-x86_64/usr/lib64/perl5/vendor_perl/auto/Cwd/Cwd.so' for module Cwd: libperl.so.5.32: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory at /cvmfs/oasis.opensciencegrid.org/mis/osg-wn-client/23-main/23.240805-1/el9-x86_64/usr/share/perl5/XSLoader.pm line 93.\r\n at /cvmfs/oasis.opensciencegrid.org/mis/osg-wn-client/23-main/23.240805-1/el9-x86_64/usr/lib64/perl5/vendor_perl/Cwd.pm line 82.\r\n```", "branch": "IB/CMSSW_14_1_X/master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1723721485", "comments": 14, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1723640000", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["externals-approved", "hold", "pending-signatures", "tests-started", "orp-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "d4a136dc2fecddc7e424e595a504a71c3f7d50f7", "merged_at": "1723721484", "merged_by": "smuzaffar", "number": 9361, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Updating cms-common: Use SCRAM V3 as default if system python3 is available", "updated_at": "1723721490", "user": "smuzaffar"}

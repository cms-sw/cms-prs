This function is used internally by the `getaddrinfo()` system call. This is causing unit tests and relvals for GCC 13/14 ASAB IBs to fail. This PR properly to add a new toolfile to explicitly link against system `resolv` library.  inking this for cmssw FWCore/Utilities should be enough to fix the cmssw issues.\r\n\r\nsee https://github.com/awslabs/aws-c-io/pull/700 and https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/59007 for more details", "branch": "IB/CMSSW_15_1_X/master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1748263092", "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1748258395", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["externals-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-started", "orp-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "94796e4fcd9db685fc4cdf1ebb119810261e57c2", "merged_at": "1748263092", "merged_by": "smuzaffar", "number": 9891, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Added tool to link resolv system lib", "updated_at": "1748263115", "user": "smuzaffar"}

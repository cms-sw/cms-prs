Users might need to set appropriate `SQLPATH` and `TNS_ADMIN` environment variables themselves. In addition to that update Oracle Instant Client version to `12.1.0.2.0`. One common version for macOS (x86_64) and Linux (x86_64, ppc64le, ppc64). Note, there is still no release for ARMv8 64-bit/ARM64/AArch64. At the same time update cx_Oracle Python package to the latest version.\n", "branch": "IB/CMSSW_8_1_X/gcc530next", "changed_files": 9, "closed_at": "1466318901", "comments": 1, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1466318893", "deletions": 453, "labels": ["externals-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-started"], "merge_commit_sha": "90dbf198d7a7503ce2ef4f723f01f9f280818026", "merged_at": "1466318901", "merged_by": "davidlt", "number": 2349, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Oracle environment removal and Oracle related packages update", "updated_at": "1466352797", "user": "davidlt"}

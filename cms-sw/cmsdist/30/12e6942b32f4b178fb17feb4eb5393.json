Thanks to Pierre Neyron.\r\n* Update NVLink bandwidth and CUDA capabilities up to NVIDIA Blackwell.", "branch": "IB/CMSSW_15_1_X/master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1739253272", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["tests-approved", "externals-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending"], "number": 9683, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Update hwloc to version 2.12.0", "updated_at": "1739288324", "user": "fwyzard"}

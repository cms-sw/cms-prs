The new version contains an expanded schema having more monitoring information. The Oracle databases were already updated as the new schema is backward compatible with both the old insert code and retrieval code.\n\nThe new insert and retrieval codes are also independent of each other, so this can just go in whenever and 0.0.3 should then be deployed in the next cmsweb upgrade.\n\nAlso updated the WMCore version (no reason really, just to stay up-to-date with the latest version).\n", "branch": "comp_gcc481", "changed_files": 0, "closed_at": "1442925905", "comments": 1, "commits": 0, "created_at": "1441021451", "deletions": 0, "labels": [], "number": 1784, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "upgrade t0wmadatasvc to 0.0.3", "updated_at": "1442925905", "user": "hufnagel"}

Can not update python to 3.10 series which requires OpenSSL 1.1.1. As we still support `slc7` releases which contain openssl 1.0.2. Although we can maintain two branches ( one for slc7 and one for el8) but lets stick to python 3.9\r\n- update pip3 to latest version 22.2.2\r\n- update setuptools to 63.4.3 ( can not update to latest 65.x or 64.x series as numpy does not work with that)\r\n- Update many pip based packages. Some of the packages are not yet using their latest versions due to build issues ( new meson backend build system  not working correctly)\r\n- Keep `numpy <1.23.0` as keras, TF and xgboost does not work with `numpy >= 1.23.0`", "branch": "IB/CMSSW_12_6_X/master", "changed_files": 40, "comments": 7, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1662788475", "deletions": 243, "labels": ["externals-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-started", "orp-pending"], "number": 8077, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Python 3.9.14 plus bulk update of many python package", "updated_at": "1662957534", "user": "smuzaffar"}

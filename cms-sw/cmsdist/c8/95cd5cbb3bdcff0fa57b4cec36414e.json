Some of the packages are not yet using their latest versions due to build issues ( new meson backend build system  not working correctly)\r\n  - Keep `numpy <1.23.0` as keras, TF and xgboost does not work with `numpy >= 1.23.0`", "branch": "IB/CMSSW_12_6_X/master", "changed_files": 42, "comments": 9, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1662788475", "deletions": 243, "labels": ["externals-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-started", "orp-pending"], "number": 8077, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Python 3.9.14 plus bulk update of many python package", "updated_at": "1662959343", "user": "smuzaffar"}

SYCL support is extended to NVIDIA and AMD GPUs. The release introduces unified memory and expands asynchronous memory allocation to buffers of any dimension. Interoperability with standard C++ is improved through `std::span` support: alpaka buffers expose a `span` interface, and any `std::span` can be used as an alpaka view. It adds compile-time warp-size definitions, extends atomic increment and decrement operations and fixes their behaviour on CPU back-end; it introduces a C++ concept for alpaka accelerators together with new type traits, along with many smaller fixes and improvements.\r\nThe CI has been updated to test newer operating systems and compilers, including Clang 20 and ROCm 6.3, 6.4, and 7.0.\r\n\r\nThe full list of changes is available in the [ChangeLog](https://github.com/alpaka-group/alpaka/blob/2.1.0/CHANGELOG.md).", "branch": "IB/CMSSW_16_1_X/master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 29, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1765599888", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["tests-approved", "externals-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-ib-failure"], "number": 10250, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "open", "title": "Update alpaka to 2.1.1 \"Fixed Transformation\"", "updated_at": "1767752656", "user": "fwyzard"}

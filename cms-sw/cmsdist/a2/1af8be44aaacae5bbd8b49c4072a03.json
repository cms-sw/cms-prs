For details, see:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/31306\r\n\r\nThis PR sets the jemalloc huge page size to the same 16MB value used by the ppc builds.  Even that probably wastes some address space--the jemalloc default if it can't find the pagesize is 2MB.\r\n\r\nCompletely untested, it has been a long time since I built anything in cmsdist by hand.", "branch": "IB/CMSSW_12_6_X/master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1668677114", "comments": 12, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1668535104", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["tests-approved", "externals-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "3f16e7f8fb6d441f3fc88d8290174dc5661f38ea", "merged_at": "1668677114", "merged_by": "smuzaffar", "number": 8181, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 6, "state": "closed", "title": "set jemalloc hugepagesize on aarch64 to avoid huge address space allocations", "updated_at": "1668677115", "user": "dan131riley"}

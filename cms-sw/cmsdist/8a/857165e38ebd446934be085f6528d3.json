The same values for cpu_type are used for -mtune as for -mcpu. If both are specified, the code generated uses the architecture and registers set by -mcpu, but the scheduling parameters set by -mtune.\r\n```\r\nthe -mcpu=power8 specifies power8 machine which is more \"generic\" while the ppc64le is more specific for our machines.\r\nIf we read the following:\r\n`The other options specify a specific processor.

This tool is installed in CMSSW for general use. A small patch is applied to protobuf to make the tool work more nicely. The tool also uses the Triton python client, which is added as a Python package external.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "IB/CMSSW_14_0_X/master", "changed_files": 6, "comments": 2, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1704917165", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["tests-pending", "externals-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending"], "number": 8935, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Triton model versioning", "updated_at": "1704917191", "user": "kpedro88"}

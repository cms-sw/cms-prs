In addition, some services like DBS uses different instances, like prod vs int, etc. To accommodate all possible use-cases DAS library first check for service URL, e.g. defined by DBS_URL, or RUCIO_URL, etc, then uses das maps, and finally construct proper URL. Depending on a client, e.g. dasgoclient CLI or das2go web client, the behavior may change, since CLI should use full URL, while web may use just API end-point and point to the same host, etc.", "branch": "IB/CMSSW_12_3_X/master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1639783530", "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1639746766", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["tests-approved", "externals-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "b9731a43c5702b16911369290f0f3b2ab5c0d19a", "merged_at": "1639783529", "merged_by": "smuzaffar", "number": 7522, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "New dasgoclient version", "updated_at": "1639783530", "user": "vkuznet"}

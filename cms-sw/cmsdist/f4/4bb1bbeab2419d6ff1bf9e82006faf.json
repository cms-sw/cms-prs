The same values for cpu_type are used for -mtune as for -mcpu. If both are specified, the code generated uses the architecture and registers set by -mcpu, but the scheduling parameters set by -mtune.\r\n```\r\nthe -mcpu=power8 specifies power8 machine which is more \"generic\" while the ppc64le is more specific for our machines.\r\nIf we read the following:\r\n`The other options specify a specific processor. Code generated under those options runs best on that processor, and may not run at all on others. `\r\nit seems to me the best flags to use will be those specifying the processor model (if it's in that list)\r\nhttps://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/RS_002f6000-and-PowerPC-Options.html#RS_002f6000-and-PowerPC-Options", "branch": "IB/CMSSW_12_0_X/master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1623324909", "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1623165170", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["externals-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-started"], "merge_commit_sha": "1e5875f5352e24b456b9d5081f25879fd4006214", "merged_at": "1623324909", "merged_by": "smuzaffar", "number": 7002, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Bring the -mcpu=power8 flag", "updated_at": "1623324909", "user": "mrodozov"}

The cuda libraries in CMSSW support cuda 11.4. Running with this configuration produces a segfault with error `cudaErrorUnsupportedPtxVersion`. As I first stated \"The JIT compilation does not work at the moment.\" The NVIDIA support person at NERSC suggested compiling for the sm_80 target or loading forward compatibility libraries. The forward compatibility libraries must be compiled with the same nvcc used for compiling cuda code in CMSSW.\r\n\r\n* Compiling cuda code in CMSSW for the sm_80 target works.\r\n* Making the forward compatibility libraries (for JIT compilation) available through LD_LIBRARY_PATH allows cuda code not compiled for the cm_80 target to be JIT compiled.", "branch": "IB/CMSSW_12_2_X/master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 50, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1635359047", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["tests-pending", "hold", "externals-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending"], "number": 7415, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Add precompiled support for A100 gpu (sm_80)", "updated_at": "1635481367", "user": "gartung"}

There are no binaries\n  in CORAL;\n- Remove GLIBC_ROOT environment variable. It was used for bash wrappers\n  around cmsRun*. Not needed anymore;\n- Do not source init.sh for file and patchelf as we install in\n  /afs/.cern.ch (write/read) and then relocate to /afs/cern.ch\n  (read-only). The paths in init.sh script are relocated, but files are\n  not yet present on /afs/cern.ch. Use binaries directly by full path.\n- If grep fails (does not find) the post-install scriplet fails. Ignore\n  if grep finds nothing.\n\n**Not tested**\n\nSigned-off-by: David Abdurachmanov David.Abdurachmanov@cern.ch\n", "branch": "IB/CMSSW_7_2_X/stable", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1406187282", "comments": 11, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1405669439", "deletions": 6, "labels": [], "merge_commit_sha": "726a43053684b99f43cfc67b3596ec258c29f486", "merged_at": "1406187282", "merged_by": "ktf", "number": 873, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix a numer of issues with glibc post-install step", "updated_at": "1406187282", "user": "davidlt"}

Muzaffar). \nCorrection to the openmpi-toolfile exported library list. \nExclusion of sherpampi and openmpi (and respective toolfiles) from the regular CMSSW build, leaving them as adds on spec available for a build on demand, as previously discussed with G. Eulisse. \nTo be used for a 5_3_12 based test build. autotools addition and sherpa usage of it not only at build time must be forward propagated (at least in 70X) when the build is validated.\n", "branch": "IB/CMSSW_5_3_X/slc5_amd64_gcc462-sherpa2", "changed_files": 8, "closed_at": "1379921677", "comments": 0, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1379486424", "deletions": 18, "labels": [], "merge_commit_sha": "6686824ecdd3e77afa2cdbf7d86a752c9a30a818", "merged_at": "1379921677", "merged_by": "smuzaffar", "number": 193, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "53 x 20130801 sherpa2beta2", "updated_at": "1379921677", "user": "fabiocos"}

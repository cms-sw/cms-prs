(I forgot that the jenkins build did not contain this (because i hadn't created this PR yet!), so during the holidays testbed did not contain the changes to WMCore added with 1.5.7.preXX)\r\n\r\n#### description\r\n\r\nThis PR contains three main changes:\r\n- crabserver: removed dbs client\r\n- crabserver: moved to WMCore `1.5.7.pre4`, since it contains https://github.com/dmwm/WMCore/pull/10916. Keep in mind that `mapellidario/WMCore/py3.211221.dario` also contains a small addition to `dmwm/WMCore/1.5.7.pre3` (basically the same as `1.5.7.pre4` for what concerns CRAB) for debugging purposes.\r\n- crabtaskworker: moved to WMCore `1.5.7.pre4`, since it contains https://github.com/dmwm/WMCore/pull/10918\r\n- adding in both `crabserver.spec` and `crabtaskworker.spec` a variable to easily change the CRABServer repository, in the same fashion as used for WMCore. This is handy for testing changes before merging into `dmwm/CRABServer` branches. These changes are not necessary and can be excluded from this PR if anyone does not like those.\r\n\r\nfyi: @belforte \r\n\r\n ", "branch": "comp_gcc630", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1641559015", "comments": 4, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1641488972", "deletions": 6, "labels": [], "merge_commit_sha": "07a8219345df32b1134e01ab702aedd72dfef123", "merged_at": "1641559015", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "number": 7532, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "crabserver: remove dbs-client, update wmcore. crabtaskworker: update wmcore.", "updated_at": "1641559016", "user": "mapellidario"}

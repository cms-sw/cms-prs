We need to install/enable this DMC EL7 Production repository:\r\n```\r\nsudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://dmc-repo.web.cern.ch/dmc-repo/dmc-el7.repo\r\nsudo yum-config-manager --enable dmc-el7/x86_64\r\n```\r\n\r\nand on the build and service-host node, we need to install these 4 packages (glib2 is likely already available):\r\n```\r\nyum install glib2 glib2-devel gfal2 gfal2-devel\r\n``` \r\nnote that the gfal2 and gfal2-devel packages must have the version `2.20.0-1.el7.cern` or higher.\r\n\r\nThen, we also have to install the gfal2 plugins on the service-host node (container). This one is mandatory:\r\n```\r\nyum install gfal2-plugin-gridftp\r\n```\r\nbut right now, this is the set of packages+plugins that we are deploying in the ms-unmerged image:\r\nhttps://github.com/dmwm/CMSKubernetes/blob/master/docker/reqmgr2ms-unmerged/Dockerfile#L13-L21", "branch": "comp_gcc630", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 12, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1632307535", "deletions": 1, "labels": [], "number": 7326, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "open", "title": "New spec for python3 gfal2", "updated_at": "1634821034", "user": "amaltaro"}

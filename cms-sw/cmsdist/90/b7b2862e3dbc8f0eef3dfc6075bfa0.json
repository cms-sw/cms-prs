One is in the Lexicon.py for the input validation and one in the migration service. Both are triggered only by certain dataset/block pattern. Both can cause failures when CRAB 2 is publishing into DBS 3.\n\nCould you deploy the DBS hot fix version 3.2.1a, which contain only those two changes, please?\n\nSorry for the inconvenience.\n\nThanks,\nYuyi & Manuel\n", "branch": "comp", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1392384443", "comments": 17, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1392326075", "deletions": 6, "labels": [], "number": 410, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "comp.pre slc5_amd64_gcc461 dbs3 dbs3-client dbs3-migration dbs3-pycurl-client ", "updated_at": "1404673549", "user": "giffels"}

ROOT6 + LLVM).\n\nAn extra patch is required for `configure` to disable `makeinfo` if\nsuch does not exist on the system. The patch brings `configure` to\nit's documented behavior. There are BZ items for `MAKEINFO=true` not\nworking as advertised.\n\n`configure` is patched instead of `configure.ac` because for\nregeneration a very specific version of `autoconf` would be required,\nwhich is too old on the system and too new in `autotools` package.\n\nSigned-off-by: David Abdurachmanov David.Abdurachmanov@cern.ch\n", "branch": "IB/CMSSW_7_6_X/next", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1435861167", "comments": 0, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1435861158", "deletions": 3, "labels": [], "merge_commit_sha": "719ba565e77e10968423b5085573aec46cd444cc", "merged_at": "1435861167", "merged_by": "davidlt", "number": 1650, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "gdb: bump to 7.9.1", "updated_at": "1435861167", "user": "davidlt"}

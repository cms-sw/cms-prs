This is causing installing `py2-dxr` packages, because LLVM might not be yet installed.\n\nTBB change incl. my bug fix to support Clang + AArch64. This is required as TBB headers end up going to Cling which is Clang-based. In addition to that, use `*.so` extension on all Linux systems not only SLC.\n", "branch": "IB/CMSSW_7_6_X/next", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1440673651", "comments": 0, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1440673633", "deletions": 4, "labels": [], "merge_commit_sha": "1fdc3fa1b0cbd7f33f1a12948fdd5efb2bd38022", "merged_at": "1440673651", "merged_by": "davidlt", "number": 1778, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "New version of TTB and dependency fix for DXR", "updated_at": "1440673655", "user": "davidlt"}

Thsi caused runtime issue as the `lib/arch/microarch/.edmplugin` is a symlink to `lib/arch/.edmplugin` and CMS FW was trying to load the `CudaAsync.so` libs from the ``lib/arch/microarch` ( as the `lib/arch/microarch/.edmplugin`  still had the ref to it). The buildrule update fixes these issue and instead of creaing symlink it now properly creates a separate `.edmplugincache` file for each  `lib/arch/microarch/.edmplugin`", "branch": "IB/CMSSW_14_1_X/master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 7, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1707290785", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["tests-approved", "externals-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending"], "number": 8990, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "BuildRule: Fix emdplugin cache for multiarch builds", "updated_at": "1707315283", "user": "smuzaffar"}

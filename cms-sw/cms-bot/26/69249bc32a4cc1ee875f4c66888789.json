There are more changes required to make `process_pr` fully py3-compatible: I see many calls to `.encode(\"ascii\", \"ignore\")` and comparision of result with string. This will no longer work, since `encode` returns `bytes` object, which can't be compared to `str` (directly or with a regex). Do you remember why these calls were added?

We should also check if files marked with \"Is this file used\" are used or not.\r\n\r\nNotable changes:\r\n* I couldn't find any references to `ActionError` in Python documentation\r\n* `runCmd` (i.e. [`subprocess.getstatusoutput`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html) ) does not throw any exceptions, even if the command fails, so surrounding it in `try..catch` is useless\r\n\r\n@smuzaffar I'd like to get this done first, this will help with the removal of ignominy. Question: do we want to maintain compatibility with Python2? If so, with which versions of Python 2?

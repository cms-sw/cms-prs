It slightly changes its paradigm: from a tool to estimate run-time memory use (which was always flawed, but useful in the past), to one that automates a big part of DQM PR validation: check that the code changes only affect the DQM output that they claim to affect.\r\n\r\nIn more detail\r\n- it now looks at harvesting output, and covers the full DQM process.\r\n- it uses the \"baseline camparison\" feature of `dqmMemoryStats.py` to get a detailed difference in content.\r\n- it condenses down this comparison to no more than 11 lines, deduplicating changes in multiple files and truncating the rest. These lines are added to the `SUMMARY`.\r\n- it reports workflow numbers for the changes found, to give a hint where to start debugging when unexpected changes appear.\r\n\r\nTo be effective, this needs https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/22925 , but it will also work without it (just outputting noise if nothing significant changed). The new comparison is about 2x slower than before (up to ~1min per file), since reading the harvesting output format is slower.\r\n\r\nThis change was only tested on a few samples locally, I hope it does not break any of the other comparisons touched.

Currently\r\n\r\n- it uses separate cmsdist branch `IB/CMSSW_15_0_X/rntuple` which for now is identical to `IB/CMSSW_15_0_X/rootmatster`. As discussed ,  unlike `IB/CMSSW_15_0_X/rootmatster` which gets updated every week, `IB/CMSSW_15_0_X/rntuple`  will not be frequently updated.\r\n- External changes from cmsdist default branch  (i.e. `IB/CMSSW_15_0_X/master`) will be automatically forward ported to `IB/CMSSW_15_0_X/rntuple`\r\n- It uses cmssw `master` branch as base.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1737992687", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "externals-pending", "tests-pending"], "number": 2423, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Replace 15.0 ROOT634 IBs with RNTUPLE", "updated_at": "1737992709", "user": "smuzaffar"}

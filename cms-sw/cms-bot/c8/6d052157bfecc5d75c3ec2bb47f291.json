After quick investigation I have discovered that `load-bot-cache` action is not recorded properly - the recorded cache contents did not match data found in comment)s_ recorded in `ReplayData/<name>.txt` file. This was because I stored a reference to cache in `actions` list.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this, and adds a script to verify that loaded cache in PRActionData matches cache in issue comments in ReplayData.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 57, "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1748422636", "deletions": 3928, "labels": ["orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "externals-pending", "tests-pending"], "number": 2511, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Fix recording load-bot-cache action", "updated_at": "1748422662", "user": "iarspider"}

In theory, if we barely exceed the comment limit and get cache to split between two comments, and then update the cache to compress better we _may_ get it to shrink. \r\n\r\nWhen tests are ran from github workflow, I don't generate coverage report, this is something we need to discuss later - e.g. we can use a webhook trigger Jenkins job to generate coverage report and host it somewhere on cmssdt, or use external service like codecov.\r\n\r\nI have changed how actions are compared (recorded vs performed): b64-encoded data is not compared. It turned out that gzip may produce different compressed bytes for the same input in different zlib versions. Instead, I have hooked `write_bot_cache` function to record uncompressed cache.

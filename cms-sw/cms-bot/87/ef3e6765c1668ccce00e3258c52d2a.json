In theory, if we barely exceed the comment limit and get cache to split between two comments, and then update the cache to compress better we _may_ get it to shrink. \r\n\r\nWhen tests are ran from github workflow, I don't generate coverage report, this is something we need to discuss later - e.g. we can use a webhook trigger Jenkins job to generate coverage report and host it somewhere on cmssdt, or use external service like codecov.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 61, "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1745396260", "deletions": 68, "labels": ["orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "externals-pending", "tests-pending"], "number": 2486, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Add more tests and start measuring coverage", "updated_at": "1745396290", "user": "iarspider"}

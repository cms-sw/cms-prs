In past we have seen cuda/LTO link issues that is why we disable lto for cuda in cmssw. This change builds G4ADEPT_X IBs without LTO\r\n\r\nFYI @civanch , @SeverinDiederichs", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1760441883", "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1760441830", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "externals-pending", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "b7858e6422f09c12c07c4ee77f60964a74cf961a", "merged_at": "1760441883", "merged_by": "smuzaffar", "number": 2593, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "G4ADEPT_X: Build without lto", "updated_at": "1760441883", "user": "smuzaffar"}

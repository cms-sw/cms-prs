For example:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit ls-remote https://github.com/cms-sw/cms-bot.git | grep pull/2616\r\n751babf4...  refs/pull/2616/head\r\n```\r\nPreviously we used the contributors branch name now use\r\n```bash\r\ngit pull --no-rebase https://github.com/cms-sw/cms-bot.git pull/2616/head\r\n```\r\nGitHub has `refs/pull/<PR>/head` for every pull request. So, pull/`<PR>/head` is guaranteed to exist and can be fetched even when the contributors branch does not exist on the cms-bot repository.\r\nResolves [#2587 ](https://github.com/cms-sw/cms-bot/issues/2587)", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1763020252", "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1762961187", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["orp-pending", "fully-signed", "tests-pending", "externals-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "24e2f2e934a3a4345e5fde8851bfa19bc6d7a08a", "merged_at": "1763020252", "merged_by": "iarspider", "number": 2615, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Updated CMS_BOT_TEST_BRANCH assignment to pull the pr.number head", "updated_at": "1763020252", "user": "akritkbehera"}

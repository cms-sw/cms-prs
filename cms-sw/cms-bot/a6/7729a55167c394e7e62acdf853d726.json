For PRs like https://github.com/cms-sw/cmsdist/pull/9679 where contents (cuda-flags) were changed but as version of cuda and toolfile revision remain same so bot did not checkout/build every package which require cuda. This change will make sure that we actually check for toolfile contents too", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1761656499", "comments": 7, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1761645298", "deletions": 8, "labels": ["orp-pending", "fully-signed", "tests-pending", "externals-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "5831fb5a3ca7097a1bff38c0c57479654a8dc0fa", "merged_at": "1761656499", "merged_by": "smuzaffar", "number": 2606, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "check the contents of toolfiles instead of version/revision", "updated_at": "1761656499", "user": "smuzaffar"}

For PRs like https://github.com/cms-sw/cmsdist/pull/9679 where contents (cuda-flags) were changed but as version of cuda and toolfile revision remain same so bot did not checkout/build every package which require cuda. This change will make sure that we actually check for toolfile contents too", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 4, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1761645298", "deletions": 8, "labels": ["orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "externals-pending", "tests-pending"], "number": 2606, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "check the contents of toolfiles instead of version/revision", "updated_at": "1761653398", "user": "smuzaffar"}

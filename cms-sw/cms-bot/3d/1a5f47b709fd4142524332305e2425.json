It also includes a special cleanup for non x86_64 (now it will only bring nodes online again if the offline reason is known, so in case one of the nodes is offline because of a different reason, e.g., building Spack, it won't bring the node online). Finally, `node-online` action on lxplus nodes brings the node online, but it stays connected to the buggy host. That is why we now send a `connect-node` action also so that jenkins runs the `connect.sh` script again avoiding the blacklisted host.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1670422787", "comments": 2, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1670398810", "deletions": 40, "labels": ["orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "externals-pending", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "ce2ddc977030e0346b3be786907931e6d2db7210", "merged_at": "1670422787", "merged_by": "smuzaffar", "number": 1901, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fixes and improvements in nodes-sanity-check job", "updated_at": "1670422787", "user": "aandvalenzuela"}

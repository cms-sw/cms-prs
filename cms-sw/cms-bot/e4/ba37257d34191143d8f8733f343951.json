If someone explicitly ask to start tests for one of the PR (e.g. pr2) then bot kills every running tests involving pr1. \r\n This changes proposes to only update PR (e.g. test-approved, test-rejected etc.) for only the PR for which the tests were explicitly started. For example if one starts multiple PRs tests from pr1 then only pr1 status will be updated. For the rest of the PRs one has to explicitly start extra tests", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1606887025", "comments": 12, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1606836521", "deletions": 35, "labels": ["comparison-available", "externals-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "6c12a04fb45183a4b36613b9ab7b8fdcecdd2f76", "merged_at": "1606887025", "merged_by": "smuzaffar", "number": 1435, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Only update status of main PR for which the tests were started", "updated_at": "1606887025", "user": "smuzaffar"}

If the corresponding branch is present in the input file, only nanoaod::FlatTable will be made and the rest of the comparisons will be skipped.\r\n        - I think that this is safe for now, but may need a fix if/when we have workflows running both RECO or PAT steps together with the NANO step\r\n        - The overhead of checking all other possible branches is too large and I wanted to minimize the time it takes to process the input nanoAOD files.\r\n- map files were updated with entries corresponding to the  available nanoAOD outputs\r\n\r\nIn the current jenkins tests I expect the new comparisons to show up for workflows 1325.7 and 10824.0\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1537276551", "comments": 1, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1536886312", "deletions": 39, "labels": ["externals-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "1791e2057119cc45a34f8f41122a018254b21926", "merged_at": "1537276551", "merged_by": "smuzaffar", "number": 1031, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": " nanoAOD EDM file monitoring added to the reco comparisons validate.C", "updated_at": "1537278453", "user": "slava77"}

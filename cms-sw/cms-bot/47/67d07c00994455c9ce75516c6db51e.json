This change proposes to use only github user login instead of user login + user name. So after this change bot will post message like \r\n```\r\nA new Pull Request was created by @smuzaffar for branch master.\r\n```\r\n instead of\r\n```\r\nA new Pull Request was created by @smuzaffar (Malik Shahzad Muzaffar) for branch master.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we want to keep the user name then we can update bot to only generate the comment messages when needed e.g. if bot has already seen the issue/PR then no need to execute https://github.com/cms-sw/cms-bot/blob/master/process_pr.py#L2322-L2345 code.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1708074201", "deletions": 10, "labels": ["orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "externals-pending", "tests-pending"], "number": 2177, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Drop user name (user login is enough) from bot messages to avoid one api call", "updated_at": "1708074227", "user": "smuzaffar"}

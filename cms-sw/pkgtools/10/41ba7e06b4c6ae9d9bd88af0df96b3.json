Global object store is shared between PR tests/IBs/Releases. So packages build at the time of PR tests can be reused by IBs and releases.\r\n\r\nOnly packages build with `hash` version suffix will be uploaded and used. So a package like `cms+coral+CORAL_2_3_21-2b43e8d10d56dd3e9004b0df65d15b02` can be uploaded/reused from global store but package like `lcg+SCRAMV1+V3_00_71` (with no `-hash` suffix) will not be uploaded/reused from the global store.\r\n\r\nFor now, only `cms` repositories upload to global object store", "branch": "V00-34-XX", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 11, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1714397799", "deletions": 14, "labels": ["orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "externals-pending", "tests-pending", "requires-external"], "number": 206, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Upload and reuse packages from the global object store", "updated_at": "1714632629", "user": "smuzaffar"}

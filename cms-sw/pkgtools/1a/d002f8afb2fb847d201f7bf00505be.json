This is a good way to create local patches when something failed but it consumes a lot time specially for packages with large code base ( pytorch, tensorflow etc.). This is a good option when debuging , so the PR proposes that by default `cmsBuild` do not use `git commit` for applied patches but one much enabled it using `--use-git-for-patches` command-line option", "branch": "V00-34-XX", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1721995686", "comments": 6, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1721972429", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["orp-pending", "fully-signed", "externals-approved", "tests-rejected", "requires-external"], "merge_commit_sha": "7a96d6aadb183a9db10cd9ba62fbd39a8b5de10b", "merged_at": "1721995686", "merged_by": "smuzaffar", "number": 212, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "use git for patching on demand", "updated_at": "1722027319", "user": "smuzaffar"}

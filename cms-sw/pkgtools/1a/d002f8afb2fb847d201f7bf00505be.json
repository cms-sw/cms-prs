This is a good way to create local patches when something failed but it consumes a lot time specially for packages with large code base ( pytorch, tensorflow etc.). This is a good option when debuging , so the PR proposes that by default `cmsBuild` do not use `git commit` for applied patches but one much enabled it using `--use-git-for-patches` command-line option", "branch": "V00-34-XX", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1721972429", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-started", "externals-pending", "requires-external"], "number": 212, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "use git for patching on demand", "updated_at": "1721994336", "user": "smuzaffar"}

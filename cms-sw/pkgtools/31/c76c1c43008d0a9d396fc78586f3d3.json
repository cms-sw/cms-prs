This was not used and functionality should be replaced by used incremental uploaded repositories\r\n- special `--tag=hash` is used to using package checksum as tag\r\n- `--link-parent-repository` option added. This allow to `upload` (without `--sync-back`) to new repo without copying all the packages from parent repo. This option should be used with `--tag=hash` to make sure that packages contain the checksum in the name instead of random `-cmsNN` . This will save a lot of disk space on the repository server and will reduce the upload time.

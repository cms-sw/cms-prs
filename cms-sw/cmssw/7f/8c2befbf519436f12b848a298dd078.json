The use of `beginJob()`/`endJob()` also simplifies the code because those functions are not called if the job is properly configured to use CPU only and therefore the `CUDAService` check is not necessary.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1654002509", "deletions": 35, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-rejected"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 38145, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Move counter initialization and printout+destruction to begin/endJob in CAHitNtupletGeneratorOnGPU", "updated_at": "1654002940", "user": "makortel"}

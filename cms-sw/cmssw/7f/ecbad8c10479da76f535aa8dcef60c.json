Get tinyxml2 [1] and put tinyxml2.h and tinyxml2.cc into CommonTools/MVAUtils/src/\r\n2. Go into `RecoParticleFlow/PFProducer`, clone https://github.com/cms-data/RecoParticleFlow-PFProducer and rename the cloned repository to `data`. Remove the existing data directory if there is already one.\r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/leethomason/tinyxml2\r\n[2] https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/CommonTools/MVAUtils/src/GBRForestTools.cc#L10", "branch": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "changed_files": 8, "comments": 23, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1552500079", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["alca-pending", "analysis-pending", "comparison-available", "db-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "requires-external", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 26176, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 5, "state": "open", "title": "[10.2.X] Additional GBRForest parser without TMVA for LowPtGsfElectrons", "updated_at": "1552724685", "user": "guitargeek"}

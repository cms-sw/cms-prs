Get tinyxml2 [1] and put tinyxml2.h and tinyxml2.cc into CommonTools/MVAUtils/src/\r\n2. Go into `RecoParticleFlow/PFProducer`, clone https://github.com/cms-data/RecoParticleFlow-PFProducer and rename the cloned repository to `data`. Remove the existing data directory if there is already one.\r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/leethomason/tinyxml2\r\n[2] https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/CommonTools/MVAUtils/src/GBRForestTools.cc#L10", "branch": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "changed_files": 8, "closed_at": "1553025856", "comments": 45, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1552500079", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["alca-approved", "analysis-approved", "comparison-available", "db-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "requires-external", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "856cdc49754320b1794ab6009a1ffce668a4db80", "merged_at": "1553025856", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 26176, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 8, "state": "closed", "title": "[10.2.X] Additional GBRForest parser without TMVA for LowPtGsfElectrons", "updated_at": "1553106440", "user": "guitargeek"}

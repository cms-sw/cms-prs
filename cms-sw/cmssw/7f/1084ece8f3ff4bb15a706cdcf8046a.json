As described [in this cross-POG presentation](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1079178/contributions/4606748) the expected new collection size is at the order of 12-19 B/event, with a ~0.03 ms/event filling time.\r\nThe stored proton attributes are:\r\n* its vertex longitudinal coordinate (to point at simulated vertex position)\r\n* its transverse and longitudinal momentum (providing Mandelstam-t and the adimensional xi fractional momentum loss)\r\n* a boolean flag stating if the proton arises from signal (e.g. central exclusive processes), or from pileup.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode developed in 10_6_X, forward-ported to master branch, and tested in both environments. Compiles, produces the expected output ; matrix tests running.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR: N/A\r\n\r\nBefore submitting your pull requests, make sure you followed this checklist:\r\n- [x] verify that the PR is really intended for the chosen branch\r\n- [x] verify that changes follow [CMS Naming, Coding, And Style Rules](http://cms-sw.github.io/cms_coding_rules.html)\r\n- [x] verify that the PR passes the basic test procedure suggested in the [CMSSW PR instructions](https://cms-sw.github.io/PRWorkflow.html)\r\n\r\ncc: @michael-pitt, @fabferro ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 0, "commits": 11, "created_at": "1636567825", "deletions": 7, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending", "xpog-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_2_X", "number": 36080, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[PPS][NanoAOD] Generator-level proton information", "updated_at": "1636567870", "user": "forthommel"}

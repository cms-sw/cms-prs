It was checked that all newly added dependencies are actually required by the package with `git grep`.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 10, "closed_at": "1612195612", "comments": 12, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1611824863", "deletions": 16, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "db-approved", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "hlt-approved", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "08a23c0060d845f1da67daf4a744adb15a6e5fdc", "merged_at": "1612195612", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 32762, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "More BuildFiles cleaning", "updated_at": "1612195652", "user": "guitargeek"}

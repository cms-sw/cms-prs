No idea why.  This makes the second change that was missing from #4860.\nThe following plot shows the calo tower electromagnetic energy as a function of eta for 50 events of QCD in Shashlik at 140 pileup.  SLHC16_patch1 (i.e. only the change in #4860) is in blue, and after applying this pull request is in black.\n\n![fixedshashlikee](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6480160/3789063/0d669170-1a8a-11e4-8af9-e9da6200c69f.png)\n", "branch": "CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1407364994", "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1407007333", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "52ca29ee648032930b49095dae3b789f4ae660b8", "merged_at": "1407364994", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "number": 4869, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Also add EcalHitsEK to subdets, so that pileup is digitised", "updated_at": "1427128062", "user": "mark-grimes"}

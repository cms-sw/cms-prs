In addition the anti-electron-in-deadECal tauID is added to NanoAOD.\r\n\r\nNote: updates for nanoAOD are still governed by the `run2_miniAOD_devel` modifier and require a followup PR (probably central one by the NanoAOD team).\r\n\r\nWarning: RECO/AOD content will be also modified when RECO sequence run (by mistake) with the `run2_miniAOD_UL` modifier used.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nVerified with custom configurations to produce miniAOD and nanoAOD (with cmsDriver) that changes are as expected for `run2_miniAOD_UL` or `run2_miniAOD_devel modifier used and that nothing changes when none of the modifiers is used. \r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nCan be seen as a backport of #27465 for coherency of UL re-miniAOD with 10_6_X and 11_2_X as discussed in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/27465#issuecomment-669294131\r\nAdding of the anti-electron-in-deadECal tauID to NanoAOD is backport of #31077.", "branch": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1598943122", "comments": 71, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1596638379", "deletions": 228, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved", "xpog-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "91baf1b5f352fede49d3154f71e13a7b3e7d7b8f", "merged_at": "1598943121", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 31065, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 21, "state": "closed", "title": "Update tau anti electron discriminators in RECO and MiniAOD (10_6_X)", "updated_at": "1598943122", "user": "mbluj"}

Since the sequences are the same, no dqmofflineOnPAT_step is produced in the output.\r\n\r\nThis PR splits the assigment into two lines, which makes `sequenceList` and `postSequenceList` distinct again.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with a description of which tests have been performed to verify the correctness of the PR, including the eventual addition of new code for testing like unit tests, test configurations, additions or updates to the runTheMatrix test workflows -->\r\n\r\nCreated a simple config file passing `DQM:@miniAODDQM` to cmsDriver.py, requested `PostDQMOffline*` sequences are back in the `process.schedule` as they were in CMSSW_12_6_0_pre2\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

This cff was still using the old JetCorrector class which was deprecated in 2014. This was causing a unit test failure in  Configuration/DataProcessing after we deleted the central cff files for the old deprecated JetCorrectors. This migrated cff does not appear to be used in RelVals or in any other test run by the IBs.\r\n\r\nI did a straightforward migration using the new JetCorrector with the corresponding name.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nUnit test now passes in my local area.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1670908843", "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1670875416", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "urgent", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "b3d9423ce75ee71298fef3cb715de987000a55b6", "merged_at": "1670908843", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "number": 40301, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Migrate HI_DiJetSkim_cff.py to use reco::JetCorrector", "updated_at": "1670908843", "user": "wddgit"}

The re-weighting is based on the 2D cluster templates for the Phase 1 Pixel Detector introduced in #22458 , which is now merged. In addition to changes in the digitizer part, a bug was fixed in the template definition.\r\n\r\nThe newly added code is _by default turned off_, a flag in the configuration is needed to run it. Therefore the changes in the digitizer are fully backwards compatible.\r\nWe still open a PR for the upcoming release in order to simplify the testing and future development of the re-weighting.\r\n\r\nFor running the new code, the following lines serve as an example:\r\n```\r\nfrom SimGeneral.MixingModule.pixelDigitizer_cfi import *\r\nprocess.mix.digitizers.pixel.UseTemplateAgeing = cms.bool(True)\r\n\r\nfrom Configuration.AlCa.GlobalTag import GlobalTag\r\nprocess.GlobalTag = GlobalTag(process.GlobalTag, '101X_upgrade2018_realistic_Candidate_2018_03_15_16_26_46', '')\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe GlobalTag was created for this purpose by @tvami  - there are also alternatives for loading the databases available if needed.\r\n\r\nHere is a quick note on the concept and plots with tests in the current status: https://desycloud.desy.de/index.php/s/63lG4vCeMNf7XaE", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 40, "commits": 15, "created_at": "1523272094", "deletions": 57, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 22911, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 26, "state": "open", "title": "Pixel Digitizer: Cluster charge re-weighting for 10_2_X", "updated_at": "1523628753", "user": "schuetzepaul"}

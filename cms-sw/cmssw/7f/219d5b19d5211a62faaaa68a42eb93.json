I guess this has only historical reasons, without any explicit desire. This PR just sets the isMC option to True even in the case at least one of these additional steps is required.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe output configurations for test wf 503.0 (GEN only) and 521.0 (LHE only) are unchanged. The failing test reported by @srimanob now succeed even without specifying the ```--mc``` command line option.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1558118623", "comments": 15, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1558087589", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "operations-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "b6f5852f0d17a7f765247cfa21d06ef461afce74", "merged_at": "1558118623", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 26819, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add in cmsDriver LHE and GEN as steps defining the isMC option", "updated_at": "1558118623", "user": "fabiocos"}

The scoped `SystemOfUnits.h` seems to be more appropriate for a large sw project.\r\n\r\nThe total count of warnings goes down from 48.6K to 14K.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 36, "comments": 2, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1714130197", "deletions": 126, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "dqm-pending", "core-pending", "db-pending", "geometry-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-pending", "xpog-pending", "heterogeneous-pending", "tracking", "trk", "ml-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 44855, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "cleanup of frequent shadow warnings", "updated_at": "1714131076", "user": "slava77"}

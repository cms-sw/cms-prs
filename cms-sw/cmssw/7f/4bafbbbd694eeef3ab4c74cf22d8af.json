The names of offline and online pu ID are now the same. Nevertheless,this PR targets mainly the offline pu ID. The fix includes that cut-based variables have the same name as MVA variables as well as including the pull variable in the offline pu ID. The code was tested and gives reasonable values for all variables (online and offline) before running the MVA.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1479228020", "comments": 5, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1447322619", "deletions": 135, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-rejected", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 12398, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Backport offline PU ID fix from #12053 to 74", "updated_at": "1479228020", "user": "ahinzmann"}

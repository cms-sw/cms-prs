Remove\ndependency on boost and use standard library features. According to C++\nstandard you are not allowed to use `cref/ref` with rvalues. In this\nparticular case you are not allowed to pass `e.streamID()` as a\nreference. I think, `std::reference_wrapper` is not allowed to hold a\nreference to a temporary, otherwise it would be undefined behavior.\n\nDetails: http://wg21.cmeerw.net/lwg/issue688\n\nSigned-off-by: David Abdurachmanov David.Abdurachmanov@cern.ch\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_3_X", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": "1415817706", "comments": 10, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1415786054", "deletions": 35, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "c5d3486461c521841a1bf89375a5d1d932b66442", "merged_at": "1415817706", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_3_X", "number": 6353, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Replace boost::{bind,cref,ref} with std:: version; C++11 compliant", "updated_at": "1415817706", "user": "davidlt"}

See https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/38726 and https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/38751 for details.\r\n\r\nFollowing modifications are introduced:\r\n- Unify WP masking interface to a single function `_tauIdWPMask()`;\r\n- Option to compute WP flags from raw scores (`from_raw` argument in `_tauIdWPMask()`) given the threshold values, instead of reading them directly from MINIAOD;\r\n- Change the format of storing WPs from bitmask to integer values for user-friendliness.\r\n\r\nChange of the format of storing WPs affects all present tauIDs and thus is not backward compatible. For instance if old versions of nano (with old eras) were produced with this PR integrated they would have format which is not backward compatible with the same versions without this PR. We think, however, that there is not realistic use-case, i.e. old versions of nano are not produced with new releases. Keeping backward compatibility is possible, but implementation will be painful. Comments from experts are welcome.\r\n\r\nBackport to 12_4_X foreseen.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1658728669", "comments": 6, "commits": 21, "created_at": "1658150380", "deletions": 131, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "xpog-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 38776, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Updated way to store DeepTau WPs in nanoAOD", "updated_at": "1658728669", "user": "kandrosov"}

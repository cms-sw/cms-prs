If this pull request will be fully signed again before #7915 gets merged, then we can close the old one and continue with this one only. Otherwise, once #7915 is merged we will rebase this one and the need for the other signatures will disappear\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 30, "closed_at": "1426523718", "comments": 30, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1425480681", "deletions": 20344, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "fully-signed", "hlt-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "6e802a60a60caa76cfbc9811a43ec28884fe12b4", "merged_at": "1426523718", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 8071, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "HLT menu updates 74X", "updated_at": "1433241843", "user": "perrotta"}

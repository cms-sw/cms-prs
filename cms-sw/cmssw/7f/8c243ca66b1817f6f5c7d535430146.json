It was lost after migration to DD4hep. This information exist only during simulation of an event and is not persistent but is used in special tests, for example with SimWatchers. \r\n\r\nNo effect on MC production is expected, no change of hits/digi.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\nBackport to 12_4_X would be useful.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1657797706", "comments": 12, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1657685772", "deletions": 13, "labels": ["simulation-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "bug-fix", "orp-approved", "urgent", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "cb2ed7fe64e19b8172f9e77639743699535dd573", "merged_at": "1657797705", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 38716, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fixed MC truth data on particle transfer from tracker to calorimeter", "updated_at": "1657797706", "user": "civanch"}

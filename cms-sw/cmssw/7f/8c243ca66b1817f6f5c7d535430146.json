It was lost after migration to DD4hep. This information exist only during simulation of an event and is not persistent but is used in special tests, for example with SimWatchers. \r\n\r\nNo effect on MC production is expected.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

(unsigned) long long was changed to (U)Long64_t, and std::basic_string was changed to std::string. Because these names affect branch names, this creates an incompatibility between ROOT5 and ROOT6. The backward compatibility issue (reading ROOT5 files in ROOT6) was fixed a long time ago. However, the fix was imperfect because the fix incorrectly removed the processing needed for the ROOT5 name for string from the algorithm.  This fix restores the improperly removed code, and will make this file identical with 7_4_X after PR#7736 is merged there.\nPlease merge as soon as convenient.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_ROOT6_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1423871731", "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1423868275", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "core-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "494611da7b2335e2cc56457628b136ba1787a5c6", "merged_at": "1423871731", "merged_by": "davidlt", "number": 7737, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Must handle ROOT5 name for strings in ROOT6", "updated_at": "1425054210", "user": "wmtan"}

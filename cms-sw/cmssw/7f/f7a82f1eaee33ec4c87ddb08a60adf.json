The time before and after each of these signals is assigned to the calling module, while the interval between the two is assigned to `Source` since the framework is effectively reading from the input file. \r\nThis change fixes the observed fluctuation of Phase 2 Muon modules' timing as reported in the [HLT Upgrade meeting on 13/05/2025](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1547579/#5-update-on-timing-variation-o).\r\nThe issue was further investigated and relates back to modules that consume `L1TkMuon`s and in particular a `TrackerMuonRefVector` defined [here](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/763da79e4e09c5053b9d64c6516816c4942bdd51/DataFormats/L1TMuonPhase2/interface/TrackerMuon.h#L21),  which has then access to an `edm::Ptr<L1TTTrackType>`. Introducing a generic consumer to consume `\"*TTTrack*_*_*_*\", \"*_l1tStubsGmt_*_*\"` directly in `HLTBeginSequence` completely masks the issue and removes the warnings related to the unsupported signals for both Phase 1 and Phase 2 workflows.\r\n\r\nRelated to #40433 and #48062\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe proposed fix has been tested both with and without the `genericConsumer` as you can see in the following picture\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1771\" height=\"947\" alt=\"plot(1)\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a6d7bfc-8a72-4d73-a63d-885d041059a0\" />\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that, moving from before to after the fix, there is a shift in where the time is assigned with the source module growing and the Muon slice shrinking as expected, but the overall time is not impacted.\r\n\r\nThese measurements have been obtained by running a benchmark with both the current `FastTimerService` and the updated one in the same job as to have the most precise comparison between the two.

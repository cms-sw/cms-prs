This resulted in the number of digis stored in the output collection being non-deterministic.\r\nIn addition an option to run the spike cleaning algorithm with potentially different (tighter) settings than in the EcalRecHitProducer was added.\r\nRefactoring of the code improved the execution time by removing calculations for uncalibrated rechits below the amplitude threshold.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nWith the fix the output digis collection contains the same number of elements every time the code runs.\r\nAdding tighter spike killer thresholds results in fewer digis being stored as expected.\r\nPassed most matrix tests (some failed at the DBS step).\r\n\r\nBackport of #49852 for 16_0_X for 2026 HLT ECAL calibration path upgrades to reduce spikes in the digis stored in the phi symmetry dataset.", "branch": "CMSSW_16_0_X", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1768853758", "deletions": 38, "labels": ["hlt-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "backport-ok", "ecal"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_0_X", "number": 49871, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Fix HLTEcalPhiSymFilter and add spike cleaning option - 160X", "updated_at": "1768999008", "user": "thomreis"}

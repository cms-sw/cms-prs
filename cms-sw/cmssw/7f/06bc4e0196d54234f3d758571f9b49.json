{"additions": 47, "auther_ref": "Phase2-WF7", "auther_sha": "8d79df737172eddc82344a5d57501457322e3366", "author": "kpedro88", "body": "Testing #14713 revealed an issue with `CaloTowerHardcodeGeometryLoader`. This was fixed by modifying the definition of `CaloTowerTopology::lastHERing_` for correct handling of the case where HE is skipped (currently, no CaloTowers are desired for the Phase2 endcap with HGCal). I also switched to using `std::vector::at()` in `CaloTowerHardcodeGeometryLoader` to make the proximate cause of the issue more visible in case something similar pops up in the future, and added a bunch of debug statements behind a preprocessor flag.\n\nI noticed that some of the changes in #14713 messed up the dense indexing for CaloTowers, because the CaloTower ieta was not continuous. This is fixed now, even though it leads to the somewhat strange convention of Phase2 HF CaloTowers starting at ieta=17.\n\nNB: To test Phase2 workflows (I used 11000.0) in the latest IB, #14755 is also needed.\n\nattn: @bsunanda\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1465449374", "comments": 27, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1464898597", "deletions": 24, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "7c47b16410e78bf4ed57c869f9b08298cfa52964", "merged_at": "1465449374", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 14756, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "fix CaloTowerTopology for HGCal/BH", "updated_at": "1465449375", "user": "kpedro88"}

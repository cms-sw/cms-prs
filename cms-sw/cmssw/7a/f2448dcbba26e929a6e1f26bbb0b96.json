It has been checked by the Menu team: the efficiency is good (95% of the previous benchmark for muons with 2-5 GeV). The rate of the multimuon seeds is still too large (100 kHz for triple muon 533), but it is still quite a lot of reduction wrt to the older ID.\r\n\r\nBackport of local https://github.com/cms-l1t-offline/cmssw/pull/1022", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 4, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1654840968", "deletions": 8, "labels": ["l1-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 38315, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[L1T] New low pt muon LUT", "updated_at": "1654843439", "user": "cecilecaillol"}

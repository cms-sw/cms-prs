It has been checked by the Menu team: the efficiency is good (95% of the previous benchmark for muons with 2-5 GeV). The rate of the multimuon seeds is still too large (100 kHz for triple muon 533), but it is still quite a lot of reduction wrt to the older ID.\r\n\r\nBackport of local https://github.com/cms-l1t-offline/cmssw/pull/1022", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1654861618", "comments": 8, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1654840968", "deletions": 8, "labels": ["l1-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "40dac7628a6cc20a09a23b61b65796b6108ff513", "merged_at": "1654861618", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 38315, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "[L1T] New low pt muon LUT", "updated_at": "1654861618", "user": "cecilecaillol"}

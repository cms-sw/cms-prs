They are:\r\n\r\n`src/PFJetsTauOverlapRemoval.cc` (edited)\r\nOnly has been changed to loop over the full input jet collection and push_back all cross-cleaned jets.\r\n\r\n`interface/L1TJetsMatchingOnly.h` (new)\r\nBased on the existing interface/L1TJetsMatching.h, this is a new simplified module to only do matching between L1T filter objects and a jet collection. It decouples the mjj, pt and matching cuts that were originally done all together in the L1TJetsMatching.h module to allow for a clearer understanding of sources of inefficiency in the VBF+Taus trigger path. \r\n\r\n`src/PFJetsMaxInvMassModule.cc` (new)\r\n`interface/PFJetsMaxInvMassModule.h` (new)\r\nThis producer looks for the max invariant dijet mass pair. No cuts are applied on mjj at this stage. An additional feature allows the user to select whether the produced jet collection contains the found max invariant dijet mass pair only or drops these from the input collection. This is for a specific case of the VBF+Taus trigger.\r\n(NB. L1TJetsMatching.h has not been changed directly as it is used by other triggers)\r\n\r\nThe three triggers that will benefit from these modules are:\r\n`HLT_(VBF_DoubleJet115_40)_DiTau_20`\r\n`HLT_(VBF_DoubleJet40)_DiTau_115_20`\r\n`HLT_(VBF_DoubleJet40)+SingleJet115_DiTau_20`\r\nseeded by VBF L1 seeds.\r\n\r\nThese are currently under development/testing. They are based on the existing `HLT_VBF_DoubleLooseChargedIsoPFTau20_Trk1_eta2p1_Reg_v` triggers and should replace them. \r\n\r\nThe PR will therefore be required asap to finalise the trigger configs.

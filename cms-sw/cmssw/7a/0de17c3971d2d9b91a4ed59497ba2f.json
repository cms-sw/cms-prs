Using separate CaloHitResponse objects solves the problem. This fix was backported from 81X.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1460744675", "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1460744428", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-started"], "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 14102, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "separate CaloHitResponse for QIE10", "updated_at": "1460744676", "user": "kpedro88"}

To fix this issue, additional lines are added to suppress the too high number of chambers. This fix is temporary because the origin of the too large number is still missing. This is why I called it a 'safe guard.'\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe code of the run issued in #38976 is run again, and I've checked that the memory usage (RSS) is reduced.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nThis is a backport of #39060", "branch": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1660660354", "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1660553096", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "urgent", "backport-ok"], "merge_commit_sha": "d7beb0080304c0d0270d31a18e03c12a6213fcdd", "merged_at": "1660660354", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 39061, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "A safe guard on GEM DQM harvester, a backport to 12_4_X", "updated_at": "1660660355", "user": "quark2"}

Due to the different sources, the structure is not perfect, but I think it covers all important aspects and, most importantly, matches the current implementation.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nNo code is affected. I did proof-read it once.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1584030081", "comments": 10, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1583940727", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "0d584cecbe11a2b5c6d03c591fecf9e444710e61", "merged_at": "1584030081", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 29184, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "DQM: Add README for DQMServices/Core.", "updated_at": "1584030081", "user": "schneiml"}

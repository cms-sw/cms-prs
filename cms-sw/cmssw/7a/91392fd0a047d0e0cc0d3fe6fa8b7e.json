Logic works as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Find the peak of counts in the TOT 1-d distribution (the peak must be located at TOT<20ns) -> this define the TOTMAX_bin\r\nFrom TOTMAX_bin move to higher TOT till the counts are below THR% of max -> this define the upper_tot_range for the fit (in any case below 18 ns)\r\n2. From TOTMAX_bin move to lower TOT till the counts are below THR% of max -> this define the lower_tot_range for the fit (in any case above 8ns)\r\n3. Fit the 2d profile in the range (upper_tot_range, lower_tot_range)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nStandard wfs for PPS timing calibration.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

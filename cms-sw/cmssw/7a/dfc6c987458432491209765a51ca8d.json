It is now obsolete. The Rucio based catalogs now provide the functionality it used to provide. In addition, there is some cleanup in the same files affected by the TrivialFileCatalog deletion. \r\n\r\nThis should not affect the behavior or output of cmsRun processes.\r\n\r\nSee Issue #47058.\r\n\r\nResolves https://github.com/cms-sw/framework-team/issues/1486\r\nResolves https://github.com/cms-sw/framework-team/issues/1488\r\n\r\nFYI @stlammel\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI reviewed the coverage of the unit tests for the files affected by this change and with the deletion of TrivialFileCatalog the unit tests provide good coverage for the InputFileCatalog and FileLocator classes. I added a tiny bit to those tests, but they were good already. The unit tests pass.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 14, "closed_at": "1761102034", "comments": 24, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1760123497", "deletions": 539, "labels": ["core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "49f114cc363e15e1bb6420650740ea35a845a8f4", "merged_at": "1761102034", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_16_0_X", "number": 49134, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 14, "state": "closed", "title": "Remove obsolete TrivialFileCatalog", "updated_at": "1761102035", "user": "wddgit"}

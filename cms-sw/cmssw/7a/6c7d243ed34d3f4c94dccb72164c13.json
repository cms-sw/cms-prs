It relies on a static global that causes\nmultithreading issues. And it does not work\ncorrectly with SubProcesses.\n\nI replaced the function with an alternative that\nshould behave in exactly the same way. Although\nI had to move the function call from the preallocate\nmethod to the preBeginJob method.\n\nI do not know how to test this. Can someone test?\nIf preBeginJob gets called and then it succeeds\nin getting the process parameter set, then all should\nbe OK.\nAutomatically ported from CMSSW_7_5_X #9697 (original by @wddgit).\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1437463994", "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1435038520", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["comparison-available", "daq-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "ee4158e4f0b5ac178a5d46e521d0dbfd4f6ce7e6", "merged_at": "1437463994", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 9770, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Replace call to getProcessParameterSet", "updated_at": "1474632162", "user": "cmsbuild"}

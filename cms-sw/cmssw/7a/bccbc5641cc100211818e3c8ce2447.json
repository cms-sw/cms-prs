As the emulator is not in any standard sequences yet, no changes are expected. A similar version of this code has been running our emulation studies on CICADA for a while.\r\n\r\n### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nThis PR is not a backport. A backport is only foreseen if L1/HLT menu studies are performed on earlier versions of CMSSW.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 3, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1698085171", "deletions": 102, "labels": ["l1-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "requires-external", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_3_X", "number": 43091, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Cleanup CICADA/CaloSummary emulation and make CICADA versions available as templated plugins", "updated_at": "1698085865", "user": "aloeliger"}

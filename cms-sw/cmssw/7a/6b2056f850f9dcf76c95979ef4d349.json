This update is proposed in parallel to the update of the BTL numbering scheme, that also requires the update of all references.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles, runs and provide the desired order in the output ```MTDgeometry``` for the BTL part.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1734358055", "deletions": 8, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "geometry-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_0_X", "number": 46963, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "MTD geometry: activate the reordering of MTD reconstruction geometry", "updated_at": "1734358197", "user": "fabiocos"}

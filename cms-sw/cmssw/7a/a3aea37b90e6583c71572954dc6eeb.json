After some investigations, it was observed that a determined sequence of measurements led to an infinite loop in the muon OI trajectory reconstruction. In particular, a pair of valid and invalid (with detId=0) hits was continuously added to the trajectory.\r\n\r\nTo solve that, a custom `muonToBeContinued` (similar to `toBeContinued`) function is implemented for the `MuonCkfTrajectoryBuilder` class. There, if the number of measurements is sufficiently large the last hit, the last to last hit, and the last to last to last hit are checked. If the current hit is equal to the last-2, and the last hit is equal to the last-3; then that temporal trajectory is not continued.  \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nFirst, the PR is confirmed to successfully solve the issue in [CMSHLT-3557](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSHLT-3557). Secondly, it was checked that no other seed from that run fired the logic. A third validation is ongoing to confirm that there is no physics difference.  \r\n\r\nFYI: @missirol @mtosi @slava77 \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 4, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1749818861", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "hlt-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "tracking"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 48318, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Filter infinite loops in muon trajectory reconstruction [CMSHLT-3557]", "updated_at": "1749819403", "user": "BlancoFS"}

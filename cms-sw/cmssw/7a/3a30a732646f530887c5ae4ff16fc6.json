Therefore, when this gain is divided out of the Geant4 energy in the simulation to calculate the number of photoelectrons, the crosstalk should also be divided out. We model the crosstalk with a Borel-Tanner distribution which has mean 1/(1-lambda).\n\n@mariadalfonso showed that this fixes the single pion response: https://dalfonso.web.cern.ch/dalfonso/HCAL/isoTrack/AbsoluteHCALResponse_afterfixes.pdf\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1477078500", "comments": 15, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1477050071", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "39c2b570e741505c045964e591883ff086c44c24", "merged_at": "1477078500", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 16302, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix crosstalk", "updated_at": "1477413092", "user": "kpedro88"}

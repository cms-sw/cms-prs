We only use this variable if `useRun3CCLUT_OTMB` or `useRun3CCLUT_TMB` is enabled. That's why I left the max value as 65536 if these flags are disabled. \r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with a description of the feature proposed or problem addressed, specifying:\r\n  - what changes are expected in the output if any, \r\n  - what other PRs or externals it depends upon if any,\r\n  - link to any additional material useful to provide a documentation for this PR (slides, JIRA tickets, related pull requestes, hypernews, TWiki or Indico pages)  -->\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nValidated by checking failed workflows from https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/38373.

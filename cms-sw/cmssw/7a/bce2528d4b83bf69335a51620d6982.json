This new function is added without changing the implementation of `reduceRange()` because changing `reduceRange()` could cause slight differences in program behavior. Usage of `reduceRange()` can later be replaced on a case-by-case basis where better performance and precision is required.\r\n\r\nThe `Phi` class in `DataFormats/GeometryVector/interface/Phi.h` represents an angle that maintains a value from -pi to pi. This PR enhances this class in a backwardly compatible fashion to allow the option of keeping the angle in the range from 0 to 2pi.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the generic angle utilities in the `GeantUnits.h` file are moved to `deltaPhi.h` because they are not Geant-specific and should be usable without subjecting code to Geant conventions.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nA unit test program is included in this PR, and it verifies basic functions of the code and gives some rough performance measures.\r\n\r\nSome performance results comparing `reduceRange()` and `make0to2pi` are shown below.\r\n\r\nNo backport is needed.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 9, "comments": 46, "commits": 11, "created_at": "1553115839", "deletions": 101, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "geometry-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending", "upgrade-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 26227, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Adding angle utilities", "updated_at": "1555689319", "user": "cvuosalo"}

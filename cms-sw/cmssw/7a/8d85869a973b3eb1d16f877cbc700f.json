To prevent a miscommunication between GE2/1 TPs and the GEM-CSC local trigger, the EMTF, or the GEM packer/unpacker, I added a member `part_` in the `GEMPadDigi` and `GEMPadDigiCluster`. This was requested by EMTF folks. This way it should be relatively easy to check which geometry you are dealing with by calling `nPartitions()`. (Retry of #30998.) 16-partition  GE2/1 pads are currently rejected in the GEM-CSC trigger and GEM validation.\r\n\r\nThis PR is to be followed with an update of the EMTF to reject 16-partition GE2/1 pads temporarily until algorithms or validation modules are updated. \r\n\r\nSee also #https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/31264.\r\n \r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested with WF 23234.0\r\n\r\n```\r\n23234.0_TTbar_14TeV+2026D49+TTbar_14TeV_TuneCP5_GenSimHLBeamSpot14+DigiTrigger+RecoGlobal+HARVESTGlobal Step0-PASSED Step1-PASSED Step2-PASSED Step3-PASSED  - time date Thu Aug 27 12:06:19 2020-date Thu Aug 27 11:33:38 2020; exit: 0 0 0 0\r\n1 1 1 1 tests passed, 0 0 0 0 failed\r\n```\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nN/A \r\n\r\n@watson-ij @bsunanda @jshlee @jiafulow @eyigitba", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 14, "closed_at": "1599836786", "comments": 86, "commits": 15, "created_at": "1598541212", "deletions": 25, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "geometry-approved", "l1-pending", "orp-approved", "pending-signatures", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "2586bd24d54198a211cd6cdbbbbc00c976bf82c2", "merged_at": "1599836786", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 31268, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "Add partition number in GEM trigger primitives", "updated_at": "1599836786", "user": "dildick"}

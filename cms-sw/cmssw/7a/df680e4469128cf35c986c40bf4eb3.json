Framework unit tests (including new ones) pass.\r\n\r\nfixes #34633\r\nfixes #31199\r\nfixes makortel/framework#210", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 14, "closed_at": "1628577643", "comments": 63, "commits": 10, "created_at": "1627923603", "deletions": 836, "labels": ["core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "requires-external", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "b6555c2495b2fa27b299c0d629d0190240b60d14", "merged_at": "1628577643", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "number": 34735, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 9, "state": "closed", "title": "Rewrote checkForModuleDependencyCorrectness", "updated_at": "1628577644", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

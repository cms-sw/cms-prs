The change in `PhysicsTools/NanoAOD/python/autoNANO.py` is because of a removal of a duplicate function -- the change is to point it to the preserved version of the function. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI ran the related workflows: `2500.313_hcalDPGCalibNANO130Xrun3` and `2500.312_hcalDPGNANO130Xrun3` (which until recently were numbered 1060.1 and 1060.2). They looked fine.\r\n\r\nNo backport is needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 13, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1721931323", "deletions": 87, "labels": ["fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "xpog-approved", "hcal"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 45561, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "open", "title": "remove redundant customizations in HcalNano", "updated_at": "1722315193", "user": "jhakala"}

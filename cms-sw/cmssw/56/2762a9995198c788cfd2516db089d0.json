The change in `PhysicsTools/NanoAOD/python/autoNANO.py` is because of a removal of a duplicate function -- the change is to point it to the preserved version of the function. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI ran the related workflows: `2500.313_hcalDPGCalibNANO130Xrun3` and `2500.312_hcalDPGNANO130Xrun3` (which until recently numbered 1060.1 and 1060.2). They looked fine.\r\n\r\nNo backport is needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1721931323", "deletions": 86, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending", "xpog-pending", "hcal"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 45561, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "remove redundant customizations", "updated_at": "1721931348", "user": "jhakala"}

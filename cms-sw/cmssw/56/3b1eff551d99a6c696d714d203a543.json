The fine grain bit algorithm relies on trigger primitives, which are prior to where the HB TDC packing (6:2 bit LUT) is performed. The 6:2 packing occurs in PackerHelp.h (tdc1 and tdc2 implemented in https://cmssdt.cern.ch/lxr/source/EventFilter/HcalRawToDigi/plugins/PackerHelp.h). With the change, HB and HE rely on the same logic, using `tdc_boundary` to compare to the TDC values.\r\n\r\nVariable name `tdc_HE` was changed to `tdc_boundary` to be more clear. This encodes the prompt  delayed boundaries for both HB and HE. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested in `CMSSW_12_3_X_2022-03-21-1100`. Passed `runTheMatrix.py`.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nBackport of PR #37302. Backporting to 12_3_X since this is where L1 emulator was merged (PR #36919), which relies on these fine grain bits downstream. Backporting is needed since L1 rates and menu testing of the new LLP trigger seeds are impacted.", "branch": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1647956337", "deletions": 15, "labels": ["l1-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 37307, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "HCAL: fixing fine grain bits to be set based on unpacked TDC  [12_3_X backport]", "updated_at": "1648021011", "user": "gk199"}

In order to remove this last vestige of boost::shared_ptr,\nusers of EventSetup need to be converted to std::shared_ptr. This PR does this for full simulation packages. Also, std::make_shared is implemented where it makes sense, because it simplifies the code and saves a memory allocation.\nThis PR is totally technical.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 10, "closed_at": "1459799679", "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1459604292", "deletions": 20, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "e7693de829934cbeaee9aac6c00a5166107481f8", "merged_at": "1459799679", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 13899, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Use std::shared_ptr and std::make_shared (EventSetup in Simulation)", "updated_at": "1464230118", "user": "wmtan"}

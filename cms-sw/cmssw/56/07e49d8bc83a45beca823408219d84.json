UBSAN reported that some calling code of getEtSum was dereferencing a nullptr to pass to the routine.\r\n\r\nC++ says references can never be assigned to a nullptr and the compiler/optimizer are allowed to use that. Therefore the internal routine being called CAN have the check for nullptr ignored which can lead to incorrect execution. Only by having getEtSum also take an address rather than a reference can the code be guaranteed to be what was expected.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1728312531", "comments": 10, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1728049962", "deletions": 17, "labels": ["dqm-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "628e45dbb3aa6bbf7ef3a116bdd53f6dad2e6ad1", "merged_at": "1728312531", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_14_2_X", "number": 46271, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Pass pointer to EgammaRecHitIsolation::getEtSum", "updated_at": "1728312532", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

The mentioned issue is https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/32550. \r\n\r\nTo summarize: there was an index running from 0 to the `matches` vector size `matches.size()`, that was fetching for elements inside the vector `dxys`, while there was no guaranteed one to one correspondence between their sizes in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/393431e92ddacdecbf24d4ff8cca29951177ee7a/HLTriggerOffline/Exotica/src/HLTExoticaPlotter.cc#L151-L153\r\nSome dedicated counters to correctly fill `dxys` and get its elements were created.\r\n\r\nThe code was tested using local files and showed no more discrepancy between the size of the `dxys` vector with the index that get its elements. The command `runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos` was run with success.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1623143809", "comments": 10, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1623103934", "deletions": 7, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "9b64f44912acf576e3e579e8b54b8d85afcebdb5", "merged_at": "1623143809", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "number": 34006, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Issue fix in Exotica HLT validation code", "updated_at": "1623143810", "user": "borzari"}

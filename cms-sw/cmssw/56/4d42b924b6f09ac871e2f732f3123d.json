Thanks to the additional configuration validation few invalid parameters were identified and were removed from HLT and offline reconstruction configurations.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis branch passes:\r\n   * `addOnTests.py`\r\n   * `hltPhase2UpgradeIntegrationTests`\r\n   * `runTheMatrix.py -l limited --ibeos`\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

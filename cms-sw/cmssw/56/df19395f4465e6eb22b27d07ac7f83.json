Changes were made to make the MVA calculated for each selector as opposed to for each iteration. We added pT as a variable to the MVA. Support for two sets of MVA variables was added. \"Prompt\" MVA includes d0 and dz infomation. \"Detached\" MVA does not, which is the same as the previous version. We also changed the way vertex matching is done: if a track has weight for a vertex, it is associated to that vertex; otherwise it is associated to the nearest in dz. A couple minor bug fixes were made as well.\n\nThis PR will have to accompany a new payload for the MVA.\n\nThe changes will be discussed in the TRK POG meeting on 18 May (sorry for the late notice).\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 15, "closed_at": "1433010216", "comments": 56, "commits": 37, "created_at": "1431845683", "deletions": 170, "labels": ["alca-pending", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "fef273a0e9539b2df0794bede6d470f568e802fe", "merged_at": "1433010216", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 9119, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 7, "state": "closed", "title": "New mixed triplet seed layers and updates to MVA selectors", "updated_at": "1433010217", "user": "mhwalker"}

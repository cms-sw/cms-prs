It only differs by updates to Tau LUTs requested for inclusion by TSG (but not used yet by default).\n\nWe can integrate and merge this as is, and make a tiny update later when the externals are ready.\n\nUnfortunately, due to updates to Provenance, the same branch cannot be used in both 80x and 81x.  As a result, I have to scrap PR #14091.  So this PR supersedes #14091, #14025, and #14026.\n\nNow that we have removed the use of Provenance, there should be no difference with the 80x version of the PR (#14092), once we cherry pick the removal commit.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 65, "closed_at": "1461045538", "comments": 63, "commits": 8, "created_at": "1460746323", "deletions": 1015, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "05c4d7f52ef6db0f91c0976b650121ab4c8d12fe", "merged_at": "1461045538", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 14104, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "Bring L1T (nearly) too l1t-tsg-v5 (81x version)", "updated_at": "1461046086", "user": "mulhearn"}

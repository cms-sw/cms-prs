However HLTrigger_EventContent_cff.py is produced semi-automatically from the HLT menu used by TSG.\r\n\r\nThis means that currently AOD and MINIAOD know only the current scouting collections, and therefore running reMINI from Run-2 data we might loose the Run-2 scouting collections.\r\nPast scouting objects are also added in FEVT and RECO dataformat, in case one wants to reprocess the some old RAW data/simulation\r\n\r\nThis issue have been already discussed in [CMSHLT-3593](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSHLT-3593) and https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/48465 , as in 2024 we replaced hltScoutingMuonPacker collection with hltScoutingMuonPackerVtx and hltScoutingMuonPackerNoVtx collections\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new file HLTrigger/Configuration/python/HLTScouting_EventContent_cff.py with the definition of all scouting collections used since Run-2. This file is used in Configuration/EventContent/python/EventContent_cff.py to include the scouting collections to all HLT event contents.\r\n\r\nNote: for Phase-2, this approach will allow use to reprocess Run-3 data with scouting collection.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n`cmsDriver.py step2  -s PAT,VALIDATION:@miniAODValidation,DQM:@miniAODDQM --era Run2_2018 -n 100 --process PAT --conditions auto:phase1_2018_realistic --mc  --scenario pp --eventcontent MINIAODSIM,DQM --datatier MINIAODSIM,DQMIO --procModifiers run2_miniAOD_UL_preSummer20 --filein root://eoscms.cern.ch//store/user/cmsbuild/store/relval/CMSSW_10_6_4/RelValProdTTbar_13_pmx25ns/AODSIM/PUpmx25ns_106X_upgrade2018_realistic_v9-v1/10000/4440FA53-897B-9A4B-AD76-D1337B591A2F.root --fileout file:step2.root  --number 1`  \r\n(taken from `runTheMatrix.py -l 2500.024`)\r\nwith the PR, checking that it contains the Run-2 scouting objects.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need \r\n\r\nBackport of #48630\r\nWe need to fix this for possible future production done in 15_0_X. This is important to be able to process 2023 data in 15_0_X.

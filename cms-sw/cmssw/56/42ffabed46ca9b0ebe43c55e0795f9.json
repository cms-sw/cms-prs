The changes are as described in the DP note exactly, except following things\r\n\r\n- the boolean variables ```filter_```, ```isSaturated_```, and ```peakFilter_``` have been dropped for the collection [SiStripApproxCluster_v1](https://github.com/saswatinandan/cmssw/blob/HI_test_with_v1/DataFormats/SiStripCluster/interface/SiStripApproximateCluster_v1.h) and encoded to the ```compBarycenter_ ``` and ```compavgCharge_```. It reduces the size of strip collection by 5%.\r\n-  A flag ```v1``` is [added](https://github.com/saswatinandan/cmssw/blob/HI_test_with_v1/RecoLocalTracker/SiStripClusterizer/plugins/SiStripApprox2Clusters.cc#L50) to the code so that default and the new version can be run. To run v1 online, this line should be added to the hlt configuration file ```process.hltSiStripClusters2ApproxClusters = cms.EDProducer(\"SiStripClusters2ApproxClusters_v1\"....``` instead of ```process.hltSiStripClusters2ApproxClusters = cms.EDProducer(\"SiStripClusters2ApproxClusters\"....```.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 10, "comments": 9, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1759082912", "deletions": 12, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved", "trk", "changes-dataformats"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_0_X", "number": 49015, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Hi test with v1", "updated_at": "1759123163", "user": "saswatinandan"}

It contains a protection to prevent extracting CM medians for non-ZS modes (because they are not present then), but that did not take the nonstandard packet codes into account yet, so an exception was thrown (and caught and converted into warning by the calling code) when unpacking with `UnpackCommonModeValues = True`.\r\nAs far as I know this feature is only used for specific studies of the zero-suppression settings, so there is no urgent need to have this in a release.\r\n\r\nCC: @CesarBernardes @alesaggio ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1539441084", "comments": 15, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1538734289", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "84a56241b41fa622c4eca9ecaf70f40686a50918", "merged_at": "1539441084", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_4_X", "number": 24812, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "SiStrip unpacker: update packet code check in cmMedian (for nonstandard ZS modes)", "updated_at": "1539441084", "user": "pieterdavid"}

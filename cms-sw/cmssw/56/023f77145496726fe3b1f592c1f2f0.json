The flag is set to false by default. The motivation for this change includes:\r\n  * the \"misaligned\" geometry is only used in special alignment studies,\r\n  * the \"misaligned\" geometry causes problems in PPS HLT workflows (in progress), probably due to missing conditions data in the DB.\r\n\r\nThis PR is expected to be fully backward compatible, with no impact on the results from standard workflows. The (mis)alignment studies have so far been performed with the \"direct\" simulation of PPS, which uses `CTPPSCompositeESSource` instead of `CTPPSGeometryESModule`. The direct simulation is thus not affected by this PR.\r\n\r\nNo backports are foreseen.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nThe plots below compare histograms produced before this PR (blue) and with this PR (red dashed):\r\n  * direct simulation WFs: [dirsim_cmp.pdf](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/files/7234888/dirsim_cmp.pdf) -- no difference as expected.\r\n  * Run2 reconstruction WFs: [reco_cmp.pdf](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/files/7234889/reco_cmp.pdf) -- no difference as expected.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 6, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1632726367", "deletions": 11, "labels": ["geometry-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "number": 35423, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "PPS: misaligned geometry built only optionally, off by default", "updated_at": "1632835367", "user": "jan-kaspar"}

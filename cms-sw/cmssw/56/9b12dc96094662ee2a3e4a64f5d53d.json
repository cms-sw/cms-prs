For now NanoAOD tables relating to objects (Jets, Electrons, Photons, etc.) are grouped into untyped collections instead of having all of the fields be at the top level. It would be ideal to do something similar for trigger flags so that they can be grouped into untyped records, but the fact that trigger fields can be added midway through writing complicates things. We will continue discussions about this to reach a restructuring that is convenient, but that hopefully doesn't break backwards compatibility. This PR will be merged before all of this is done so that the CI doesn't continue to fail for other PRs, but we will continue to develop this code in a future PR.", "branch": "CMSSW_15_1_RNTUPLE_X", "changed_files": 14, "comments": 41, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1747151355", "deletions": 167, "labels": ["fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "xpog-approved"], "number": 48071, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "open", "title": "Preliminary fixes for NanoAODRNTupleOutputModule", "updated_at": "1754422664", "user": "ariostas"}

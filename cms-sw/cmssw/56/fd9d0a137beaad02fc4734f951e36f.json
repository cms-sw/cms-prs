The warning raised the old design issue where a mix of basic arbitration types defined in MuonSegmentMatch and arbitration flags designed for end-users (Muon::ArbitrationType) were allowed to be used with the same interface. At the moment the only safe way to address the warning is to change the input type, which effectively doesn't change anything beside removing the warning. Long term we may want to address the issue more directly and forbid mixing arbitration types. This however requires a detailed validation, which is not wise to do so late in the release development cycle.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1529586365", "comments": 22, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1529067919", "deletions": 8, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "2eff18f90767ecf31993d7549913394806b35f7a", "merged_at": "1529586365", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 23599, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "[muon] fixed compilation warning in DataFormats/MuonReco (ArbitrationType to unsigned int)", "updated_at": "1529586365", "user": "drkovalskyi"}

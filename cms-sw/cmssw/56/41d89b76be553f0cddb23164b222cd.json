The appropriate training to be used is selected automatically. The idea is that the variable name will stay the same in the future, selecting a new training when appropriate.\r\n- No need to store working points as bools since these can be easily derived from the MVA value.\r\n\r\n- In addition to this PR: renaming mva Egamma IDs to be more generic \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n- Tested in CMSSW_12_4_0_pre1; verified that the new variable is added correctly.\r\n- Adds 1 float per electron.\r\n\r\nThis PR is a backport of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/38355\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1658213839", "comments": 12, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1657602847", "deletions": 44, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "backport-ok", "xpog-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "9a82500d08e0e9c5a961c3a46e766273d874bccb", "merged_at": "1658213839", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 38698, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "[12_4_X] Adding HZZ electron MVA ID ", "updated_at": "1658213839", "user": "asculac"}

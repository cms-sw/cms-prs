The appropriate training to be used is selected automatically. The idea is that the variable name will stay the same in the future, selecting a new training when appropriate.\r\n- No need to store working points as bools since these can be easily derived from the MVA value.\r\n\r\n- In addition to this PR: renaming mva Egamma IDs to be more generic \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n- Tested in CMSSW_12_4_0_pre1; verified that the new variable is added correctly.\r\n- Adds 1 float per electron.\r\n\r\nThis PR is a backport of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/38355\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 1, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1657602847", "deletions": 44, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "xpog-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 38698, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[12_4_X] Adding HZZ electron MVA ID ", "updated_at": "1657602874", "user": "asculac"}

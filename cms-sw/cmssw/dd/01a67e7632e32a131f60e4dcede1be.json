These corrections mitigate a hardware defect in the laser calibration system (in the light attenuation filter). They are applied only for data, as this defect is not modelled in the MC. The hardware will be fixed later this year, so these corrections are not needed in the future.\r\n\r\nAlso, very minor optimizations are made to the M0 rechit time code (no changes to the algorithm).\r\n\r\nThis is a pure maintenance PR. It is not supposed to modify any relval results.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n\"runTheMatrix\" script was run and the results appear to be normal.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1552502025", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 26177, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Masking legacy HB- energy correction for Run 3", "updated_at": "1552516156", "user": "igv4321"}

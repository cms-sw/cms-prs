So I simplified its definition (first commit), and for consistency also the Event-system-side `useProductDirectly` (second commit) to be independent of `T`. In the Event-system case I also replaced the `#ifdef` with the use of type traits.\r\n\r\nResolves https://github.com/cms-sw/framework-team/issues/1126\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nUnit tests pass on nodes with and without NVIDIA GPU.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 12, "comments": 1, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1735833203", "deletions": 56, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending", "heterogeneous-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_0_X", "number": 47034, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Make Alpaka ESProducers asynchronous for non-host backends", "updated_at": "1735833230", "user": "makortel"}

They are extended to the UPC era, although this era is so far only used for the reco step, not for the digi one.  In case the UPC era is used for digi at some point, it's better to change this now.  \r\n\r\nThe heavy-ion embedding (event overlay) workflows are not extended to 2024 yet.   This will be done in a subsequent PR.  \r\n\r\nNo backport will be needed. \r\n ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 10, "comments": 10, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1719361098", "deletions": 17, "labels": ["simulation-pending", "l1-pending", "operations-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 45307, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "open", "title": "Update heavy-ion eras for 2024 + add MC RelVal workflows", "updated_at": "1719411161", "user": "mandrenguyen"}

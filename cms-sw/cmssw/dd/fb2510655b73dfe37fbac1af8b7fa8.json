The end type does not\nchange.\n\nFixes the following warning:\n\n```\nWarning: Selection file classes_def.xml, lines 28 and 26. Attempt to\nselect with a named selection rule an already selected class. The name\nused in the selection is \"ESAngleCorrectionFactors\" while the class is\n\"ESCondObjectContainer\".\n```\n\n`ESIntercalibConstants` and `ESAngleCorrectionFactors` are both\n`ESCondObjectContainer<float>`.\n\nTested by comparing `seal_cap.cc`, which does not change after this\npatchset.\n\nSigned-off-by: David Abdurachmanov David.Abdurachmanov@cern.ch\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1433599909", "comments": 6, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1433012254", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["alca-approved", "comparison-pending", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "4e52d9d3ee73f99c4a84a4d98a35a5631c385e15", "merged_at": "1433599909", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 9358, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "CondFormats/ESObjects: dictionary cleanup", "updated_at": "1433599909", "user": "davidlt"}

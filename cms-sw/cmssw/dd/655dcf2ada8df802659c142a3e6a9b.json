The class `PixelRegionContainers` is modified in order to allow the display of conditions for the Phase-2 Pixel. In order to do that an auxiliary struct `PhaseInfo` is introduced and used where necessary. Usages of that class outside of `CondCore/SiPixelPlugins` (namely in ` Alignment/OfflineValidation`) are adjusted accordingly.\r\nI profit of this PR to migrate to the new class templates introduced in #29622 where not yet done.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRelies on the existing unit tests.\r\nExample of plot obtainable with Phase-2 LA tags:\r\n\r\n![B55E4E1E-EE68-104E-9738-85EB6CB036B7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5082376/91426346-b1739a00-e85c-11ea-8345-4279a510a1e6.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nNot a backport, and no backport is needed.\r\ncc: @tvami", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 9, "closed_at": "1599045034", "comments": 12, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1598529838", "deletions": 343, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "db-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "eba4d35aea0b6906d765b38920eb2dc258d142f2", "merged_at": "1599045034", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 31260, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Support phase-2 IT tags in pixel Payload Inspector", "updated_at": "1599045034", "user": "mmusich"}

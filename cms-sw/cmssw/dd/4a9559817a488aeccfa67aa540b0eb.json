[PR #28945](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/28945) introduced a very small backwards compatabibility issue that was pointed out in [this ](https://hypernews.cern.ch/HyperNews/CMS/get/pixelOfflineSW/1543.html )hypernews thread. A config to reproduce the crash is [here](http://musich.web.cern.ch/musich/display/reproduce_crash_cfg.py)\r\n\r\nThe issue is that there was one pixel template that was used for 0T conditions in 2017 that had a template ID of 0. The PR #28945 synced with standalone calibration code that used ID = 0 to signify a special calibration template and bypass some of the regular functionality. So this meant this specific template would no longer be used correctly. This PR makes the very small change of requiring these calibration templates to have a negative ID instead of 0. There should be no changes in anything except for things with GT's containing this specific payload (SiPixelTemplateDBObject_phase1_0T_mc_v2). \r\n\r\n@mmusich @tvami @pmaksim1 @slava77 @perrotta \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1593537992", "comments": 13, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1593195542", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "ab8e45a636a29c735357cf74b1ddbbbc0e373d6b", "merged_at": "1593537992", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 30435, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Allow pixel template ID = 0 to ensure backwards compatibility", "updated_at": "1593537992", "user": "OzAmram"}

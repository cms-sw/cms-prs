In AlphaTVarProducer.cc, the change is just white space.  In  DataFormats/TauReco/src/classes_def_3.xml, it is the removal of ignored lines in an xml file.  In  DataFormats/TrajectoryState/test/BuildFile.xml, it is the removal of an unnecessary link dependency that was added in 7_4_ROOT6_X\nPlease merge as soon as convenient.  Test if you must (due to the removal of a link dependency), but please bypass L2 signatures if not signed in a timely manner.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_ROOT6_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1426596985", "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1426544349", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "4a7940f37789f92df0a64c9fc98d83b197846efd", "merged_at": "1426596985", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "number": 8336, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Trivial changes to become common with 7_4_X", "updated_at": "1426597400", "user": "wmtan"}

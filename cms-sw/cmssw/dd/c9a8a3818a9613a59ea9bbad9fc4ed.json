The code was also extended to create plots for the Y direction, which are not very useful for the strips but now also generated. For the pixels, plots are generated for each layer and each disk, note that the disk plots appear in the first half cylinder folder even though they cover the full disk.\n\nThe old pixel residual code was left in place. \n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1455638456", "comments": 17, "commits": 9, "created_at": "1455110867", "deletions": 85, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "9c36ac7131328aa7b1c60f52425c9bd8b8880e72", "merged_at": "1455638456", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 13240, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "DQM new pixel residuals", "updated_at": "1455638457", "user": "schneiml"}

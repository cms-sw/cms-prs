At the end of the job, the output is copied from the batch node to eos. Recently we have noticed more frequent failures in this procedure. The changes in this PR add a checksum check to the xrdcp command used to copy the files. In addition, in the job status accounting at the end, copy failures are now reported\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nTested on around 300 jobs, works as expected. Only affects jobs run as part of millepede alignment - no other dependencies. Should not affect the output of standard tests\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\nNot a backport\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1557944850", "comments": 11, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1557817470", "deletions": 9, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "f00c9ac0155c7be420814579d51d038a6cb99f7e", "merged_at": "1557944850", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 26774, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "TkAl: Improving job output copying + error reporting", "updated_at": "1557944851", "user": "adewit"}

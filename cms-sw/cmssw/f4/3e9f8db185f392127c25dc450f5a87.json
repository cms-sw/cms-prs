This is needed because this simulation uses old `LHCInfo` no matter the run number.\r\nWhat's also added is a backup mechanism for the selection inside `LHCInfoCombined` - one using `isRealData()` from `edm::Event()`: If `IsRealData()` returns `false`, always take old `LHCInfo`. This mechanism will only be useful if `Direct Simulation` would be ran without `Era_Run3_CTPPS_directSim`  modifier.\r\nThe 2 modules that don't have access to edm::Event are problematic, since they can't access `isRealData()` and will make `LHCInfoCombined` look for new records (if ran without `Era_Run3_CTPPS_directSim`  modifier) even during `Direct Simulation`, leading to an Exception being raised.\r\nThese modules are:\r\n* CalibPPS/ESProducers/plugins/CTPPSInterpolatedOpticalFunctionsESSource.cc\r\n* CalibPPS/ESProducers/plugins/CTPPSBeamParametersFromLHCInfoESSource.cc\r\n\r\nIts worth noting they are both `ESProducers`.

This is needed because this simulation uses old `LHCInfo` no matter the run number. (In every other case modules ran in Run3 should be looking for new `LHCInfoPer*` records)\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with a description of the feature proposed or problem addressed, specifying:\r\n  - what changes are expected in the output if any, \r\n  - what other PRs or externals it depends upon if any,\r\n  - link to any additional material useful to provide a documentation for this PR (slides, JIRA tickets, related pull requestes, hypernews, TWiki or Indico pages)  -->\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTo validate please run Validation/CTPPS/test/simu/run_multiple\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 32, "comments": 52, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1695819235", "deletions": 88, "labels": ["operations-pending", "alca-approved", "dqm-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "db-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "number": 42890, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 41, "state": "open", "title": "CTPPS update Run3 Direct Simulation to use old LHCInfo after LHCInfo update", "updated_at": "1703150527", "user": "Glitchmin"}

The name used by the framework typing system uses a \"u\" after the value.  The names used by the conditions code do not.  This pull request takes this into account when comparing names, thereby preventing the fatal exceptions.\nPlease merge this request promptly unless there are problems.\nThis request handles \"u\", \"ul\", \"ull\", \"l\" and \"ll\" suffixes.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_ROOT6_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1394518724", "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1394500686", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["db-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "ec934f3e84c8d3b6c6e9cea796c5b9d07bb0c1c4", "merged_at": "1394518724", "merged_by": "ktf", "number": 2800, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix name discrepancy for unsigned types", "updated_at": "1394564096", "user": "wmtan"}

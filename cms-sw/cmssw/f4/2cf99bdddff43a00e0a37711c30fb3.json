One pieces of the EgammaElectronAlgos that I do not really like is the ElectronHcalHelper, because it is essentially a non-threadsafe wrapper around EgammaTowerIsolation. I don't think this abstraction layer is needed. Using the isolation classes directly results in shorter and more direct code, enables a few conversions from stream to global plugins among the EgammaHLTProducer plugins and we can also use this opportunity to spread some usage of `ESGetToken` instead of manual cashing of event setup products. Also, not using it removes the dependence of the EgammaHLTProducers on libEgammaElectronAlgos.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCMSSW compiles and local matrix tests pass.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\n\r\nNo backport intended.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1577545932", "comments": 12, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1576515976", "deletions": 334, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "hlt-approved", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "e747e4654a94eb1724874f456eee9e06cd2cd7f0", "merged_at": "1577545932", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 28633, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Don't use ElectronHcalHelper in EgammaHLTProducers", "updated_at": "1577545932", "user": "guitargeek"}

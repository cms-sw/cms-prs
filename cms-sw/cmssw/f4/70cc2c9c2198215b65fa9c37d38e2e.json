If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nNot a backport, but it will be backported to CMSSW_15_0_X for 2025 operations.\r\n\r\nCc: @silviodonato @elfontan @patinkaew ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 4, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1755589903", "deletions": 19, "labels": ["hlt-pending", "operations-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 48763, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Improve HLT Scouting DataFormat event content handing in derived datasets", "updated_at": "1755590041", "user": "mmusich"}

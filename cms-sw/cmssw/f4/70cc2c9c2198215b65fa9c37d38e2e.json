If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nNot a backport, but it will be backported to CMSSW_15_0_X for 2025 operations.\r\n\r\nCc: @silviodonato @elfontan @patinkaew ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1755614442", "comments": 8, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1755589903", "deletions": 19, "labels": ["hlt-approved", "operations-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "44d5c77d5675b19030ca542af1c1871d086e2c2e", "merged_at": "1755614442", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 48763, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Improve HLT Scouting DataFormat event content handing in derived datasets", "updated_at": "1755614443", "user": "mmusich"}

Therefore, an additional fix is provided here. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe code was run with the fix, and it was made sure it does lead to a crash if the last file is missing (also tested if the first on is missing, one and only one file in the collection and missing, all files missing). \r\n\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1638962152", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["core-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 36412, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Fixing bug in case last file is bad", "updated_at": "1638962173", "user": "mhuwiler"}

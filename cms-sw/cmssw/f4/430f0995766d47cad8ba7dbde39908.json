Therefore, an additional fix is provided here. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe code was run with the fix, and it was made sure it does lead to a crash if the last file is missing (also tested if the first on is missing, one and only one file in the collection and missing, all files missing). \r\n\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1639007144", "comments": 7, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1638962152", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "3accc80358fd05b9439084c4cfec934280f923ee", "merged_at": "1639007144", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 36412, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "Fixing bug in case last file is bad", "updated_at": "1639007144", "user": "mhuwiler"}

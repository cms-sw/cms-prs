This fix throws a read error instead, which is on the whitelist of acceptable-to-retry errors.\n\nThanks!\n\n@bbockelm\n", "branch": "CMSSW_5_3_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1395865737", "comments": 6, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1395074708", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["fully-signed", "generators-approved", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "ee070f476e2364d71d559b7e1b2e06a645485b82", "merged_at": "1395865737", "merged_by": "smuzaffar", "milestone": "CMSSW_5_3_X", "number": 2897, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Throw a read error and not a generic error when an LHE read fails", "updated_at": "1395865737", "user": "PerilousApricot"}

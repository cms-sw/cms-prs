This will be fixed in a future pre-release as it requires retraining of an associated MVA and some tweaking of the algorithm.  This does not affect the present performance of GsfElectrons and pfElectrons, as it is a parallel algorithm.\n\nComputing performance-wise, this algorithm has the same timing as (pfElectronAlgo+pfPhotonAlgo).\nIt has been checked in an electron gun sample with pileup and uses very little time.\n\nThis was developed in parallel to:\nhttps://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/120#issuecomment-21180476\nand should not interfere too much.\nThe only problem may be the complete rewrite of PFEGammaAlgo, since there are some changes in PR-120 that operate on the old code base.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 24, "closed_at": "1377147971", "comments": 45, "commits": 29, "created_at": "1374219087", "deletions": 3685, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "31833c96d179ebdf3d58e6a7cd1b5a8a4014ddfc", "merged_at": "1377147971", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_0_0_pre3", "number": 143, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 9, "state": "closed", "title": "PFEGamma Rewrite for CMSSW 70X", "updated_at": "1404669893", "user": "lgray"}

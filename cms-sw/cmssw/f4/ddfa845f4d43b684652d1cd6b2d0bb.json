Of course if @cms-sw/dqm-l2 (or others) disagree I'm happy to provide a 12_6_X backport as well.\r\n\r\n\r\nFYI @dzuolo @gennai @lguzzi", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1675781741", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "db-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending", "tracking"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "number": 40716, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "open", "title": "[RFC] Add try/catch in OnlineBeamMonitor plugin to resolve runtime error", "updated_at": "1675785400", "user": "francescobrivio"}

Of course if @cms-sw/dqm-l2 (or others) disagree I'm happy to provide a 12_6_X backport as well.\r\n\r\n\r\nFYI @dzuolo @gennai @lguzzi", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1676011812", "comments": 26, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1675781741", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "db-approved", "orp-approved", "requires-external", "code-checks-approved", "tracking"], "merge_commit_sha": "2f899a28884ae473969923fb54dc5478245f3098", "merged_at": "1676011812", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "number": 40716, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 6, "state": "closed", "title": "Add try/catch in OnlineBeamMonitor plugin to resolve runtime error", "updated_at": "1676011812", "user": "francescobrivio"}

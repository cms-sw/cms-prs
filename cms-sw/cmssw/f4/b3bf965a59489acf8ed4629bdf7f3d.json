The previous version was buggy because it did not correctly associate the preshower clusters with the Ecal Endcap.\r\nRafael had corrected this last year before leaving but it seems that corrected code was not committed to CMSSW. This pull request is just to put the corrected PFClusterMatchedToPhotonsSelector.cc  in. \r\n\r\nThanks", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 126, "comments": 1, "commits": 70, "created_at": "1519419699", "deletions": 1024, "labels": ["alca-pending", "analysis-pending", "code-checks-pending", "comparison-pending", "db-pending", "dqm-pending", "generators-pending", "hlt-pending", "l1-pending", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending", "upgrade-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_1_X", "number": 22334, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Updates for pfcluster 2018", "updated_at": "1519419790", "user": "jainshilpi"}

This is now possible, with N being a configurable parameter.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose, I wrote a new function `EcalClusterLazyTools<T>::getEnergies` and generally went over the EcalClusterTools/EcalClusterLazyTools duo, tying to make it a bit more slick. This includes:\r\n  * new helper class to easily iterate over rectangular ranges around seed crystals\r\n  * don't separate member function implementation from declaration for template classes because it adds a lot of distracting `template` lines (see the lazy tools)\r\n  * detabify, removal of trailing whitespaces, occasionally better line breaks", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 14, "comments": 36, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1547252444", "deletions": 935, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_5_X", "number": 25633, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 18, "state": "open", "title": "Some EcalClusterTools maintainance and energy matrix in Egamma MVA Ntuplizers", "updated_at": "1547490341", "user": "guitargeek"}

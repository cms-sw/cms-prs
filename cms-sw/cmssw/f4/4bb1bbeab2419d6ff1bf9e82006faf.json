The property mask is currently an argument to several public constructors of TypeWithDict.\nFor each such public constructor, this pull request either removes it or makes it private.  Only two lines of code outside the framework are affected.\nPlease merge this request as soon as convenient.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_ROOT6_X", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1419351170", "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1419350375", "deletions": 29, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-pending", "core-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "ed0ac432d8239c5e80d8e242e9e112c0517fd35a", "merged_at": "1419351170", "merged_by": "ktf", "number": 7002, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Don't expose TypeWithDict property mask", "updated_at": "1420229270", "user": "wmtan"}

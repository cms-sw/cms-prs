This was created by checking out a CMSSW_8_0_8_patch1 release and sequentially merging in #14463 and #14634, respectively. This has been tested to compile and run in a fresh release on lxplus, and the DQM configurations were reverted to their settings for P5 as per usual.\n\nThe commit motivating the pull request is 665d73d.\n\nThe `process.source.SelectEvents` attribute is now used, being the approved method for online filtering of HLT events.\n\nThe previous HLT filter was removed, but may be manually inserted to reproduce the filtering on lxplus by following the instructions under the \"HLT Fat Event Filter\" subsection of DQM instructions for running on [lxplus](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/Sandbox/L1TDQMModuleDev#Instructions_for_lxplus).\n\nThe rationale behind the removal is that in the offline development and testing cycle, the filter is more often than not turned off to reduce the time it takes to generate and inspect monitor elements.\n\nA corresponding PR for 81X isn't available yet for the same rationale [explained here](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/14463#issuecomment-221265851).\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 67, "closed_at": "1465476971", "comments": 2, "commits": 53, "created_at": "1464267465", "deletions": 1964, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "dqm-pending", "l1-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 14645, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "L1T DQM: Modified Fat Event Filter", "updated_at": "1465476971", "user": "swang373"}

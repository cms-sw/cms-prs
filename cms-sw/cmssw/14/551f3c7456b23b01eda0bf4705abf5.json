This movement unfies tau information available in both mini and nano data tiers. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested with custom re-mini+nano and with nano workflows.\r\nMatrix tests (limited) ongoing (result will be given when done)\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nBackport is not planned.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "comments": 6, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1727856893", "deletions": 16, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "dqm-pending", "operations-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending", "xpog-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_2_X", "number": 46196, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Move \"hybrid\" tau production from nano to mini step", "updated_at": "1727872079", "user": "mbluj"}

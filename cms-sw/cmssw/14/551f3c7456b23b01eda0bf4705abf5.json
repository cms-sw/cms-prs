This movement unfies tau information available in both mini and nano data tiers. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested with custom re-mini+nano and with nano workflows.\r\nMatrix tests (limited) successful.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

This is appropriate\nsince the static arrays are filled once in a thread safe way (std::call_once) and then\nonly read and never modified.\nFuture versions of C++ will give away to fill the arrays at construction time and therefore\nwe will be able to change them to const.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1387405848", "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1387397674", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["geometry-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "a68c3abcaca5fd1a4615577d1a5e00b144dbe911", "merged_at": "1387405848", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_0_0_pre11", "number": 1883, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Mark static arrays as thread-safe in EcalScDetId", "updated_at": "1387469549", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

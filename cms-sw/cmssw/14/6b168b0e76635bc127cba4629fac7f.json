Note that none of these changes have any effect unless the `run2` era is explicitly used.  Details on how to do that are on #7500.\n\nI haven't tested for equivalency between the postLS1 customisation and run2 era, it's getting far too time consuming to test each individual tranche.  I'll make sure the default is left unaffected and then apply incremental fixes as required once all tranches have been merged.\n\nAs mentioned on #7500, the changes in the first commit (22f41e2) are just to update for external changes to the customisations in the last week, and not strictly related to this change (but still required).\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1422999098", "comments": 5, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1422889244", "deletions": 15, "labels": ["comparison-available", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "11832527a3a8efddc2e87624bda5e5e95c723a6a", "merged_at": "1422999098", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 7503, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add g4SimHits changes to the run2 era", "updated_at": "1423154121", "user": "mark-grimes"}

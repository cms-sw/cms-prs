For 2017, both PEAK and DECO cosmic GTs are updated.  For 2021, only DECO cosmic GT is updated (the PEAK version does not exist at the moment).\r\n\r\nDesired differences with respected collision GTs are described in [1]. Updates of other cosmic GTs will follow once Ultralegacy campaigns are done.\r\n\r\n[1] https://hypernews.cern.ch/HyperNews/CMS/get/calibrations/4194.html\r\n\r\n**GT diffs wrt. collision GTs:**\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/110X_mc2017_realistic_v1/110X_mc2017cosmics_realistic_deco_v2\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/110X_mc2017_realistic_v1/110X_mc2017cosmics_realistic_peak_v2\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/110X_mcRun3_2021_realistic_v2/110X_mcRun3_2021cosmics_realistic_deco_v2\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nA technical test was performed: runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\nThis PR is not a backport.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1570212312", "comments": 16, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1569573282", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "5f71c2cd761f30ec4ccd1495747adc187b4947af", "merged_at": "1570212312", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 28079, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "AutoCond update for 2017 and 2021 cosmic GTs", "updated_at": "1570212312", "user": "tlampen"}

I tried to address them in this pull request\r\n* `static bool` was replaced by `static std::atomic<bool>`. this applies to all occurrences of `config_dumped`\r\n* instances where `std::cout` was placed at the end of an `edm::LogDebug` were replaced by `std::endl` (shouldn't the compiler pick this up?)\r\n* a few instances of local `static` variables in functions were made `const` instead where variables do not change after declaration\r\n* 2D vector patterns in `CSCComparatorDigiFitter` were declared `const`\r\n\r\nIn addition, I removed `gemCustoms.py` in `SLHCUpgradeSimulations/Configuration` since it is no longer used. Finally, all specific customization functions in `gemGeometryCustoms.py` are outdated and were removed.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 18, "closed_at": "1502843449", "comments": 27, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1501649059", "deletions": 726, "labels": ["comparison-available", "geometry-approved", "l1-approved", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "7f1e2ac9542b948be1ab4dababcbf8334038d1fb", "merged_at": "1502843449", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_3_X", "number": 20012, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix issues reported by static analyzer in CSCTriggerPrimitives", "updated_at": "1502843559", "user": "dildick"}

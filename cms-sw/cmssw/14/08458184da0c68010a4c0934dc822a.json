These plots are necessary for the PPS alignment run (23/06/22). \r\nThe added plots follow a similar implementation to an already existing one, just with different parameters.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis PR can be validated by running a DQM playback of Run 354054 (currently ongoing). No additional validation is needed, the implementation is almost identical to code that is already implemented. \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1655714534", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 38435, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Added plots for 2/3 aligned ROCs per BX", "updated_at": "1655873271", "user": "AndreaBellora"}

The code creates tracks using two hits (one per plane) drawing a straight line between them. The track is required to be isolated and horizontal. The goal is to recover at least some proton tracks for alignment/debugging purposes.\r\nThe patch is enabled by means of a runtime flag. Run2 processes are protected via Era mechanism.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRun2 data show no difference. Preliminary run3 data show recovered tracks as expected.\r\n\r\nThis PR will have to be backported to 12_4 and 12_3\r\n\r\n@jpata @grzanka @AndreaBellora \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "comments": 6, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1656502547", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 38553, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "PPS reco patch for bad pot", "updated_at": "1656580707", "user": "fabferro"}

This is necessary to absorb the ME0 system into the GEM system later on. I removed the now obsolete producer `ME0PadDigiClusterProducer`. I also removed the obsolete option in the ME0TMB to run a future realistic ME0 track segment builder on ME0 pad clusters, since the ME0 system will use pads directly. \r\n\r\nNote: this PR is a scaled-back version of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/28419 as the coordinate conversion is still under discussion.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation\r\n\r\nI tested it with WF 22034.0\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n@tahuang1991 ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 30, "closed_at": "1574367861", "comments": 20, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1574115799", "deletions": 428, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "8fc1f65324174a7b4a38b09f4c0af32d9f107dfb", "merged_at": "1574367861", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 28420, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "Merge ME0Trigger into L1TGEM", "updated_at": "1574367861", "user": "dildick"}

In the result of the bug constituents of a subjet nearby a considered tau - a seed of a nearby tau candidate - are not excluded from particles used to compute isolation of the tau, which breaks the boosted tau algorithm. The bug has been introduced in #17087 (for 90X) speeding up boosted tau seed producer code. Unfortunately the bug was discovered only recently by users (*).\r\nIn addition to the bug fix, in this PR we remove remnants of previous implementation changed by #17087.\r\n\r\nExpected changes: boosted taus (in MiniAOD), especially those with other tau candidate within R<0.5, are more isolated. This will recover state from before #17087 as shown in the figure attached to #30064.\r\n\r\nBackport of #30064. Some additional details therein.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested with the standard miniAOD workflow.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nBackport of  #30064 (using same dev branch thanks to proximity of 11_1_X and 11_2_X)\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1591203726", "comments": 11, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1591003592", "deletions": 7, "labels": ["backport-ok", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "88b60b3fdf7ca0f1a8538b8ce0ff4a7e6676039a", "merged_at": "1591203726", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 30065, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix bug affecting boosted tau isolation (11_1_X)", "updated_at": "1591203727", "user": "mbluj"}

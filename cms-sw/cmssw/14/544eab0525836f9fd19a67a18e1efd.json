It is together with #43871 part of the ongoing effort to produce RUN 3 tau embedding samples.\r\n\r\nThe tau embedding method is used to estimate the genuine di-tau background from data. It is a common method used in analyses with tau leptons. More information about tau embedding can be found in the paper: https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-0221/14/06/P06032\r\nIn principle, one can split the method into 4 steps, but technically there are at least 6 steps that have to be executed.\r\n\r\nThe following things where changed in this pull request:\r\n\r\n- For the embedding merging step: removing some collections, which were only needed for Run2\r\n- For the embedding generator HLT step: replacing a filter by a simple dummy that ignores the fact that the tau-leptons are simulated in an else empty detector.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 13, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1738951855", "deletions": 74, "labels": ["simulation-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 47299, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 6, "state": "open", "title": "Embedding update for run3", "updated_at": "1739289352", "user": "winterchristian"}

The following changes are implemented:\r\n* Track to PV association is preformed in a similar way as for tracks contained in `packedPFCandidates` collection (packed PF particles);\r\n* Detailed track information is stored down to 0.5GeV instead of current 0.95GeV as done for packed PF particles (`packedPFCandidates`). Track covariance packing schemas are adapted from producer of the packed PF particle collection for more effective packing.\r\n\r\nNote: Code was formatted with `scam b code-format` for easier backport and better comparison with master.\r\n\r\nMiniAOD size changes were estimated with 1k of DY->LL evens with 2018 conditions and it is as follows:\r\n* size increase of `patPackedCandidates_lostTracks__PAT`: 23%\r\n* size increase of full miniAOD sample: 0.2%\r\n* 1/4 of the increase comes from updated PV association information, while remaining 3/4 from lowering threshold to store detailed track info.\r\n\r\nThe changes are active only with `run2_miniAOD_UL`  modifier.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested with standard miniAOD workflow  with `run2_miniAOD_UL`  modifier.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nIt is backport of #32242, needed for UL re-miniAOD production as agreed with XPOG.", "branch": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1606722533", "comments": 11, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1606410250", "deletions": 217, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "backport-ok", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "073cb4fe1b3b8f9a2acc2510cc71aca70431920a", "merged_at": "1606722533", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 32303, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Expand track information in lostTracks collection (10_6_X)", "updated_at": "1606722534", "user": "mbluj"}

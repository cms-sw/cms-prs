First found in KNL runs but shown to be a problem in Xeon as well.\r\n\r\nPrimary fix here is to move an expensive calculation out of a loop and also to short circuit that loop when more than 2 tracks are found in the vertex.\r\n\r\nFactor many speed improvement for problem events. Should also improve the typical vertexing time, from same short circuit.", "branch": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1488541324", "comments": 21, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1487879019", "deletions": 82, "labels": ["comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-rejected", "tests-approved", "upgrade-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "number": 17622, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Primary vertexing speed improvements", "updated_at": "1488541324", "user": "lgray"}

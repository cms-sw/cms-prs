We propose to fix that in the next pre-release to keep this PR as simple as possible.\nThe # of extra tracks produced by this step is relatively modest (< 10% increase), so event size will not change dramatically.\nThe extra CPU time is also relatively modest compared to the current total tracking time.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1422664486", "comments": 13, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1422369075", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "230f84b12b6ee0bf165db87b3bb7569745ae92f0", "merged_at": "1422664486", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 7393, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add hi detached triplet step", "updated_at": "1449851498", "user": "mandrenguyen"}

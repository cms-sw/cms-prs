A number of plots were not filled for HEP17 last year because it would have mixed QIE8 and QIE11 digis; QIE11-specific plots were created in QIE11Task. Now that HE==QIE11, I integrated the plots of interest from QIE11Task to DigiTask.\r\n\r\nI also included one small bug fix for LaserTask: with the 2018 HE, the range for the laser signal has to be increased.\r\n\r\nSimilarly to the parent PR, this PR is based on top of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/22597, which will hopefully be merged soon before this one.  \r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_10_0_X", "changed_files": 16, "closed_at": "1526017440", "comments": 3, "commits": 15, "created_at": "1521815340", "deletions": 178, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "dqm-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_0_X", "number": 22725, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "HCALDQM: Update DigiTask for 2018 HE (10_0_X)", "updated_at": "1526017440", "user": "DryRun"}

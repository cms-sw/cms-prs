Instead of applying the vcal calibration in the \r\nclusterizer include it already in the gain calibration payload.  Like this the vcal calibration can \r\nbe easily adjusted for each new gain calibration.\r\nThis is the first step in which we only change the MC gain calibrations. It should apply to any future Run3 simulations. Data from Run1/2 and older, none Run3 MC, will not be affected.\r\n\r\nTo be applied for Run 3 MC & Data. No code changes, the only changes are:\r\n1. new GTs for Run3 MC which include the new gain calibration values,\r\n2. changes in the clusterizer parameters for Run 3, for the VCAL calibration use slope=1 and offset =0.\r\n\r\n\r\n  - what changes are expected in the output if any,\r\nNo changes expected to the output \r\n  - what other PRs or externals it depends upon if any,\r\nThere are no other PRs, but the change must be in sync with a GT change, this is why the autoCond.py file is also modified.\r\n\r\n  - link to any additional material useful to provide a documentation for this PR (slides, JIRA tickets, related pull requestes, hypernews, TWiki or Indico pages)  \r\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/879470/contributions/3796405/attachments/2009273/3356603/pix_off_25_3_gain_calibration_mc.pdf\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n<!-- Normal, standard testing, no additions no updates to the runTheMatrix test workflows -->\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nNo backport required.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with any link to  -->\r\n\r\nThe changes have been verified using Run3 simulations.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1587190448", "comments": 41, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1585497948", "deletions": 7, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "c8df96ff5dc2c4be221f6b524ccc052d5ace4cf3", "merged_at": "1587190448", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 29333, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 18, "state": "closed", "title": "pixel mc gain calibration scheme: new GTs for MC Run3, modified Clusterizer conditions for Run3 ", "updated_at": "1587190448", "user": "dkotlins"}

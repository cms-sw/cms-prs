For EE it would introduce a small extra smearing in the data/MC, so it is switched off for the re-reco (since the problem affects only EB). \r\nThis should then be customised to be used for 2015-2016 data only. \r\n\r\nDepending to what studies for 90X with improved multifit show, related to PR #17205, we could either use them, if positive, or fall back on this max-sample solution, for both EB and EE. \r\nShould this be implemented for 90X as well on top of PR #17205 ?\r\n\r\n@bendavid @amassiro @slava77 \r\n\r\n[1] https://indico.cern.ch/event/590956/contributions/2391934/attachments/1384258/2105710/multifit-gainswitch.pdf", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1491416479", "comments": 51, "commits": 8, "created_at": "1485256504", "deletions": 7, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "b869ac70b4d04c9b87d6e4b71fb13aea0ea18bc5", "merged_at": "1491416479", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 17259, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 4, "state": "closed", "title": "Use of Max-Sample algorithm for gain-switch cases in the barrel", "updated_at": "1491463492", "user": "emanueledimarco"}

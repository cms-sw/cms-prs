This change will be backported down to the `13_0_X` release cycle.\r\n\r\nThe alias `HLT:@relval2022` is updated to point to the `Fake2` HLT menu, i.e. the \"fake\" menu used in any wfs for conditions between 2016 and the year prior to current data-taking (in this case, 2022).\r\n\r\nThis change has knock-on effects which, while not directly under HLT's responsability, are addressed in this PR.\r\n\r\n - Just moving to the \"fake\" HLT menu would break wf `11634.7`, because the MkFit customisation for HLT proved to be, once again, too fragile against HLT changes (see https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/38816#issuecomment-1192289392 for context). The customisation is updated to avoid such issues now and in the future, and wf `12434.7` (which uses the 2023 HLT menu) is added to the RelVals tested in PRs and IBs. `12434.7` replaces `11634.7` in PR tests, and `11634.7` continues to run in IBs.\r\n\r\n - The DQM and Validation sequences of 2022 MC wfs are changed to cope with the \"fake\" HLT menu introduced in those wfs (\"FakeHLT\" DQM/Validation sequences). While implementing these changes, I _think_ I accidentally fixed several wfs that were missing some of their intended customisations, e.g. wfs `10824.8`, `10024.24`, `10034.19` and `10080.81`.

Summary of the original description\r\n\r\n> Pull request to merge an heterogeneous implementation of the silicon strip unpacker/clusterizer SiStripClusterizerFromRaw module (legacy), whose purpose is producing strip clusters from raw FED data.\r\n> \r\n> Legacy and heterogeneous implementations of the unpacker/clusterizer share both unpacking and clustering algorithms, with the heter. version having the needed generalizations to allow for parallel implementation.\r\n\r\nFurther informations in [#47629](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/47629#issue-2932714486) and comments.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nNone beyond #47629.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

This PR introduces the default config file so that any scripts which do not need specific geometry can use. Those scripts will be forwarded port every time we update the baseline. No change on geometry-specific configs. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nNo test. No change is expected as the introduced configs are not used anywhere.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\nNo need of backport.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1701691303", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1701452641", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["geometry-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "upgrade-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "84c45e899f4722e438306c6a8bf8ebafcbc0be61", "merged_at": "1701691303", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "number": 43476, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add placeholders of phase2 geometry config files", "updated_at": "1701691303", "user": "srimanob"}

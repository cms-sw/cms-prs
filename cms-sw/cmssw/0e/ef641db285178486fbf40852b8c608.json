This PR introduce the default config file so that any script that does not need specific geometry can use. All scripts will forward port everytime we update the baseline.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nNo test. No change is expected as the new config is not used anywhere.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\nNo need of backport.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 0, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1701452641", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["geometry-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "number": 43476, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Add placeholders of phase2 geometry config files", "updated_at": "1701452671", "user": "srimanob"}

This appears an issue with numerical precision. To address it:\r\n\r\n- position precision printouts is limited to 2 digits (i.e. 100 microns) for unit test output, while keeping 4 digits in the regular log file for direct inspection;\r\n- the numerical accuracy requited for rotation checks is move from std::numeric_limits<float> to 10 times as big, to prevent failure on aarch64.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode runs, provide the desired output, and does not trigger any ```DIFFERENCE``` message on lxplus-arm (el9_aarch64_gcc12) vs cmsdev45 (el8_amd64_gcc12). ```cms-data/Geometry-TestReference``` reference file is built on the default architecture.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1732283491", "deletions": 106, "labels": ["geometry-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_0_X", "number": 46761, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "MTD geometry: Fix MTDGeometryBuilder text to avoid rounding issues with alternative architectures", "updated_at": "1732283521", "user": "fabiocos"}

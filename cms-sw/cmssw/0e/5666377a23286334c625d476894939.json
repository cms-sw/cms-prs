All plugins (CA, CLUE3D, FastJet, ...) will now access the same cached model, instead of caching one model for each plugin as was the case in the EDProducer setup. \r\n\r\nThis is now in line with the RecoTracker tensorflow implementation. In this first step, we are pointing also to their tensorflow producer. Eventually, in a pull request that would follow soon, this should be harmonised and moved to a central, neutral place that both RecoTracker and RecoHGCal use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nIt saves about 5% in memory on upgrade workflow\r\n`39034.202`:\r\n\r\nhttps://bmaier.web.cern.ch/bmaier/view.php?dir=figs/hgcal/ticltf/new\r\n\r\n(The more plugins are run in the same job, the higher the savings.)\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 13, "closed_at": "1643299388", "comments": 22, "commits": 12, "created_at": "1642436814", "deletions": 126, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "upgrade-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "ac0a8b7ed712eb5b18066b12e0de57b4728f91fc", "merged_at": "1643299388", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 36724, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 5, "state": "closed", "title": "Changing tensorflow implementation in RecoHGCal/TICL", "updated_at": "1643299388", "user": "dr-stringfellow"}

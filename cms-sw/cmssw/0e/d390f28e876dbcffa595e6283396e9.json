Therefore, a trivial loop on the client-side between the\r\nreturned eta and phi bin ranges could result in fewer cells explored.\r\nThe solution implemented will return proper intervals for both eta and\r\nphi upon which the caller can perform a double for loop. It is the\r\ncaller's responsibility, though, to wrap the phi-bin inside the phi-loop\r\nto get the correctly wrapped global bin value.\r\nA corresponding unit test has been added to verify the correctness of\r\nthe implementation.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested on a Phase2 workflow with several clusters in the Scintillator section with some 1K events. No regression was observed.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 8, "comments": 6, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1649857796", "deletions": 20, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 37555, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Eta phi search in tile", "updated_at": "1649936424", "user": "rovere"}

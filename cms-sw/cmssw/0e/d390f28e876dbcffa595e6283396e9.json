Therefore, a trivial loop on the client-side between the\r\nreturned eta and phi bin ranges could result in fewer cells explored.\r\nThe solution implemented will return proper intervals for both eta and\r\nphi upon which the caller can perform a double for loop. It is the\r\ncaller's responsibility, though, to wrap the phi-bin inside the phi-loop\r\nto get the correctly wrapped global bin value.\r\nA corresponding unit test has been added to verify the correctness of\r\nthe implementation.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested on a Phase2 workflow with several clusters in the Scintillator section with some 1K events. No regression was observed.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 8, "closed_at": "1650137287", "comments": 12, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1649857796", "deletions": 20, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "upgrade-approved", "code-checks-approved", "hgcal"], "merge_commit_sha": "92dcea0ecbdfbce2a6cc0423b706daf8b00684e7", "merged_at": "1650137287", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 37555, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "Eta phi search in tile", "updated_at": "1650868499", "user": "rovere"}

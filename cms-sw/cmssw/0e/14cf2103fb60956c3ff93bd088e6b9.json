If a class that has a dictionary contains a data member whose type includes a namespace, but the namespace is not the complete scope, (i.e.) does not include the outermost namespace, a look up for the type of the data member will fail because the name used is not fully scoped.\nThis occurs in the RefToBase template, which causes many framework unit tests to fail.\nThis pull request is a workaround. It adds full scope to the type.  Although this workaround is compatible with ROOT5, I prefer to submit it to the ROOT6 branch only, and remove it after the ROOT6 bug is fixed.\nThus RefToBase.h for ROOT5 and ROOT6 will remain the same.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_ROOT6_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1387485330", "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1387472775", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "c31bf248097780638c65213f016948ed44036270", "merged_at": "1387485330", "merged_by": "davidlt", "number": 1898, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Temporary workaround for ROOT6 bug", "updated_at": "1406911549", "user": "wmtan"}

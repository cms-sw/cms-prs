Since \r\nnew fitters have much higher absolute efficiency in the pT range of interest of this collection, i.e. ~0.2-1.0GeV/c (please, see slides 2-3 of [*]), the total size of MiniAOD heavy-ion event is expected to increase by around 2-3% (with small dependency on collision centrality). Please, see slide 5 of [*].\r\n\r\nWe did timing studies. With new configuration we have almost factor 3 of reduction in timing for pixel tracking \r\ncollection sequence. Please, see slide 4 of [*].\r\n\r\n[*] https://indico.cern.ch/event/1107099/contributions/4658135/attachments/2366348/4040751/slides_HINTRKmeeting_16122021.pdf\r\n\r\nBest Regards,\r\n\r\n   Cesar A.

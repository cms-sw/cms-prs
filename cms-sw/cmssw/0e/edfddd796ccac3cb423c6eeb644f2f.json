To fix this issue, additional lines are added to suppress the too high number of chambers. This fix is temporary because the origin of the too large number is still missing. This is why I called it a 'safe guard.'\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe code of the run issued in #38976 is run again, and I've checked that the memory usage (RSS) is reduced.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1660628432", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1660553061", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "urgent", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "c14614aa4ccef6b71f9824e1d9044c46232d17d0", "merged_at": "1660628432", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 39060, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "A safe guard on GEM DQM harvester", "updated_at": "1660628433", "user": "quark2"}

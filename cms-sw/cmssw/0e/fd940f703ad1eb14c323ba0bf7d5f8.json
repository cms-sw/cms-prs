In this PR monopole simulation was reviewed for 10.4, which should work in MT mode. Monopole simulation is demonstrated and tested in so-called extended example \"monopole\", whihc is a part of Geant4 distribution.\r\n\r\nFollowing modifications are included in this PR:\r\n\r\n1) In the recent CMSSW it is not possible directly copy classes from the \"monopole\" example, so new classes within CMSSW are created according to CMSSW rules and code requirements: Monopole, MonopoleEquation, MonopoleTransportation\r\n\r\n2) Monopole physics constructor for Physics List instantiation is updated\r\n\r\n3) G4SystemOfUnits.hh and G4PhysicsConstants.hh headers are removed from header files of CMSSW sub-librraies updated in this PR, instead CLHEP namespace is used as recommended by Geant4 team\r\n\r\nNo change in the mainstream simulation is expected.

In this PR monopole simulation was reviewed for 10.4, which should work in MT mode. In Geant4 Monopole simulation is demonstrated and tested in so-called \"extended example monopole\", which is a part of Geant4 distribution.\r\n\r\nFollowing modifications are included in this PR:\r\n\r\n1) In the recent CMSSW it is not possible directly copy classes from the \"monopole\" example, so new classes within CMSSW are created according to CMSSW rules and code requirements: Monopole, MonopoleEquation, MonopoleTransportation\r\n\r\n2) Monopole physics constructor for Physics List instantiation is updated for Geant4 10.4\r\n\r\n3) G4SystemOfUnits.hh and G4PhysicsConstants.hh headers are removed from header files of CMSSW sub-librraies updated in this PR, instead CLHEP namespace is used. This is a recommended by the Geant4 team.\r\n\r\nNo change in the mainstream simulation is expected.

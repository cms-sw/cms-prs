In the CLCT and LCT I extended the definition of existing data members with bit masks and bit shifts. It was pointed out to me that although this method is economical, it does not prevent data formats from being misinterpreted, should the bit masks or shifts change in the future. CMSSW would not record changes in bit masks and shifts as changes in the data formats, as opposed to changes in data members. \r\n\r\nBottom line: 1/4-strip bit, 1/8-strip bit, Run-3 pattern and slope now have corresponding data members in CLCT and LCT. In-time bits and out-of-time bits are separated in the CSCShowerDigi.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested with WF 11634.0.

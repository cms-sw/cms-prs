I kept it for not breaking the harvesting configuration. It can be run harmlessly, though.\r\n\r\nI have modified the way some errors are defined, I kept commented the old code for reference.\r\n\r\nI have checked if the results are compatible with the old code and while doing it I found out the old code is bugged.\r\nInstead of properly reporting the values per lumi in the histograms the values are the incremental avarage of all the previously analyzed lumisection. It affected only the per lumi plots which as far as I understood they were not so much used (that's why maybe nobody noticed it).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nI have run the test/AlcaBeam_monitor_file.py to produce the histograms and I have checked they are compatible with the values from the beam spot producers\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1598683861", "comments": 27, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1598538132", "deletions": 182, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "de14565af1bafb6581251de04f85db6bdbad56ad", "merged_at": "1598683861", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 31267, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 8, "state": "closed", "title": "fixed the problem related to concurrent lumis with the AlcaBeamMonitor code", "updated_at": "1598683862", "user": "gennai"}

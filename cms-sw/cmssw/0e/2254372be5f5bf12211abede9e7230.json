It reuses the `trackingMkFitCommon` procModifier to configure the internal _mkFit_ geometry setup,  and  introduces the new procModifier `hltTrackingMkFitInitialStep` to test the _mkFit_ building primarly in a single-iteration HLT Phase-2 tracking configuration.  The _mkFit_ tracking building algorithm can also be tested at `hltInitialStep`. \r\n\r\nThe PR adds support for applying selection thresholds on the transverse momentum (`MinPtCut`) and the minimum number of hits (`MinNHitsCut`) for track candidates after the forward and backward search steps of the _mkFit_ tracking building algorithm.\r\n\r\nThe PR also fixes an inconsistency in the workflow numbering between `runTheMatrix.py` and `upgradeWorkflowComponents.py`, where the `offset` value did not match the corresponding workflow ID in the `runTheMatrix.py` comments.\r\n\r\nA new variation of the HLT timing workflow has been added, including Patatrack seeding and a single tracking iteration with _mkFit_ building. The implementation makes use of existing procModifiers, and can be executed through the corresponding procModifier sequence `alpaka,singleIterPatatrack,trackingLST,seedingLST,trackingMkFitCommon,hltTrackingMkFitInitialStep`. The workflow `.7571` is being introduced to monitor this configuration.\r\n\r\nA follow-up PR will extend this work to implement the proposed HLT Phase-2 baseline single-iteration tracking configuration (configuration 3) as presented at the [HLT Upgrade meeting](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1587306/contributions/6719158/attachments/3145286/5583730/HLTUpgrade30Sep2025.pdf). The developments in this PR are independent and provide the necessary framework for ongoing _mkFit_-related HLT studies. The main results related to the `hltInitialStep` configuration have been presented in [JIRA ticket CMSHLT-3613](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSHLT-3613), and in this [DP note](https://cds.cern.ch/record/2941438), where the configuration was executed via customisers.\r\n\r\nFYI @mmasciov @slava77 @VourMa ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 19, "comments": 28, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1761640727", "deletions": 28, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "hlt-pending", "operations-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-rejected", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "code-checks-approved", "tracking"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_0_X", "number": 49231, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 5, "state": "open", "title": "[mkFit] procModifier for Phase-2 HLT tracking and track candidates selections", "updated_at": "1761822637", "user": "bdanzi"}

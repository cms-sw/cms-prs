It is waiting for this and other pull requests that prepare modules outside the Framework for this behavior to be merged.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRelies on existing tests. The behavior of the modules should not change. The unit test ```TestGeneratorInterfacePythia8ConcurrentGeneratorFilter``` is most relevant because it has multiple lumis. It passes and I stepped through that one with a debugger and the correct things seem to be happening. These are used in a lot of runTheMatrix tests also (although usually with 1 lumi, which isn't as useful as a test). The changes are almost identical in the two modules.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 17, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1706647865", "deletions": 22, "labels": ["generators-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 43816, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 10, "state": "open", "title": "In Concurrent*Filters, upgrade to allow a stream to skip a lumi", "updated_at": "1707417375", "user": "wddgit"}

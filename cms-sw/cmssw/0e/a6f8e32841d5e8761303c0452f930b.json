I profit of that to re-adjust the commands for event contents to cope with no SCAL in Run3 that were leftover from https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/38415 and https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/38590. \r\nThis is done in commit 08f72fa00044a4d2276b0a52d14c3facb17cded9.\r\nAdditionally this contains commit 474efd4dbec2a3c13b583b5e1ea2508f7e739848 which fixes a problem with the vector hits workflow spotted in master and commit e78b930edfdb8009d1062cbcc9c8b6c34e08e303 which makes the `ClusterStorer::rekey` methods non-`const` as per recommendations in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/40363.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRun two typical workflows for Run-3 and Phase-2 with\r\n\r\n```\r\nrunTheMatrix.py -l 11634.0,20834.0 -t 4 -j 8 --ibeos\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd tested the event content of `TkAlMinBias` indeed changes as expected.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

It contains several bugfixes and small improvements of the existing code. Mainly, it brings new algorithms:\r\n  * Local tracks (input to proton reconstruction) with large angles are discarded (they cannot be coming from IP).\r\n  * Local tracks in different RPs of the same arm are associated according to optics-driven correlations. On one side, this prevents spurious track combinations (backround). On the other, it allows to perform proton reconstruction even if multiple tracks are present.\r\n  * Local tracks from timing RPs are associated with tracks from tracking RPs. This allows to append timing information to the reconstructed-proton candidates.\r\n\r\nThis PR is essential for the UL re-reco.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nBelow a comparison test of re-running the full PPS reco chain on \r\n`/store/data/Run2016B/DoubleEG/RAW/v2/000/275/371/00000/FE9F0F13-9436-E611-8F39-02163E012B47.root`. Red histograms are obtained with #26305, the blue ones with this PR. The differences are very small. The seemingly big difference in the xi plots is due to different binnings. In the other histograms (where the same binning is used), blue curves are never above the red ones. This is expected since in 2016, the (strip) detectors could not resolve more than 1 local track. Thus the only effect of this PR is the removal of spurious/doubtful local-track combinations.\r\n\r\n![cmp_45](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17830858/55482558-1190ed00-5625-11e9-81fc-93bcb42ece2b.png)\r\n\r\n![cmp_56](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17830858/55482559-1190ed00-5625-11e9-8260-aa3e2597209e.png)\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 12, "closed_at": "1555082964", "comments": 37, "commits": 9, "created_at": "1554291388", "deletions": 190, "labels": ["alca-approved", "analysis-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "orp-approved", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "c4df47f61573c705b1bcc6ca21417c7d0d2e448a", "merged_at": "1555082964", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 26335, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 12, "state": "closed", "title": "PPS: proton reconstruction, algorithm update", "updated_at": "1555082965", "user": "jan-kaspar"}

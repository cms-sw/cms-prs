They correspond to an updated evaluation of the area of the Inner Tracker that can be instrumented with 3D sensors (see https://indico.cern.ch/event/988838/contributions/4258167/attachments/2202703/3736635/em20210305.pdf).\r\n\r\nThis was mentioned previously in: https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/33064#issuecomment-799341672\r\n\r\nThis introduces:\r\n  -  T25, a Tracker based on T21, with 25x100 um2 3D pixels in Inner Tracker TBPX Layer1 and 25x100 um2 planar pixels elsewhere.\r\n -   T26, a Tracker based on T21, with 25x100 um2 3D pixels in Inner Tracker TBPX Layer1, 25x100 um2 planar pixels in TBPX Layer2, Layer3, Layer4 and 50x50 um2 pixels in TFPX and TEPX.\r\n\r\nThere are no changes in the OT wrt T21\r\n\r\nT25:\r\nGeometry scenario: 2026D80.\r\nWorkflows: 36[2|3]xx (no PU), 36[4|5]xx (PU).\r\n\r\nT26:\r\nGeometry scenario: 2026D81.\r\nWorkflows: 36[6|7]xx (no PU), 36[8|9]xx (PU).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n- Checked XMLs make sense from Tracker design point of view\r\n- Checked overlaps with Fireworks\r\n- Checked workflow numbering\r\n- Checked that workflows with scenarios D80 and D81 run smoothly with no extra errors / warnings\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nNot a backport\r\n\r\n@emiglior @mmusich @tsusa FYI", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 28, "closed_at": "1616400414", "comments": 18, "commits": 12, "created_at": "1616161411", "deletions": 9, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "operations-approved", "orp-approved", "pdmv-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved", "urgent"], "merge_commit_sha": "23fad57b764b830ddf481d6d2937589e784251db", "merged_at": "1616400414", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 33222, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Adding Phase2 tracker T25 and T26 (for IT sensor technology studies)", "updated_at": "1616400414", "user": "adewit"}

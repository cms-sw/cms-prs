This involved adding the plugin FastTrackDeDxProducer.cc and modifying FastTrackerRecHits.[.h, .cc], as well as adding a data member to the class DataFormats/TrackerRecHit2D/interface/FastTrackerRecHit.h called energyLoss.\r\n\r\nThis PR was backported earlier, but closed afterwards as it was not urgently needed for production. Now it is urgently needed for a large SUSY signal production. PPD has also been notified.\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1570515706", "comments": 13, "commits": 11, "created_at": "1569660030", "deletions": 7, "labels": ["backport-ok", "comparison-available", "fastsim-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "fb4668054dd34e418024607abdda772344a21ae5", "merged_at": "1570515706", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 28085, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fastsim tracking add dedx collection - backport to 102X", "updated_at": "1570515707", "user": "ssekmen"}

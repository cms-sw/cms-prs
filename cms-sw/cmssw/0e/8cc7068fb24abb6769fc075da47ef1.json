It is necessary for data taking with the Stage 1 trigger.  The changes to HLT configs are for demonstration purposes only, showing the needed config changes for one example.  HLT experts will need to make these changes properly in the configuration framework.  Because of a backwards incompatibility between the actual firmware and the offline anticipation of the firmware, additional customization will be needed to unpack L1 payload from RAW data produced via MC under 74X, if such capability is needed.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 75, "closed_at": "1436378687", "comments": 5, "commits": 91, "created_at": "1435306719", "deletions": 1065, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "hlt-pending", "l1-pending", "new-package-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 9908, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "L1t stage1 unpacker 75x", "updated_at": "1445196002", "user": "mulhearn"}

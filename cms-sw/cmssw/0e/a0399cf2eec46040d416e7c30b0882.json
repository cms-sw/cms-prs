This means that trigger pad clusters will not be produced in the L1-trigger chain during Phase-2. This is the currently the case in the simulation though. In Phase-2, ME0 triggers will be constructed out of trigger pads directly. This PR updates the simulation accordingly. More details can be found in this presentation: https://indico.cern.ch/event/831338/contributions/3482241/attachments/1869796/3079349/Change-ME0-001_CMS_Black.pdf. \r\n\r\nI added a flag in the configuration to choose the input (pad or pad cluster). Other modifications include additional member data and a function that was templated. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI ran the workflow 20034.0 successfully.  \r\n\r\nThere should be no change in the performance as ME0 pseudo-triggers are still the actual objects that are used in the L1T Muon chain.\r\n\r\nFYI: @jshlee @tahuang1991 @rekovic ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1569480587", "comments": 37, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1565280706", "deletions": 56, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "ea2df2a0902aabc0d66638798f18f039a5a73989", "merged_at": "1569480587", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27731, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "Allow for ME0 triggers to be produced from pads directly", "updated_at": "1569480587", "user": "dildick"}

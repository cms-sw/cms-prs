Till this is fixed, \nprefer to use unpacked CSC TPs than to individually configure muon track finders (EMTF, OMTF) emulators to do internal BX shifting of its input TPs.\n\nAn example command using the step `L1REPACK:FullSimTP` on a RAW 2016 data file:\n\n<pre>\ncmsDriver.py L1TEST --python_filename=l1t_test.py -s L1REPACK:FullSimTP  --era=Run2_2016 --conditions=80X_dataRun2_HLT_v12 -n 10 --data --filein=/store/data/Run2016B/ZeroBias/RAW/v2/000/274/442/00000/F08D3D87-762C-E611-BBB8-02163E014160.root --eventcontent  FEVTDEBUGHLT  \n</pre>\n\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1468585812", "comments": 16, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1468353648", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["comparison-available", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-approved", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 15182, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 6, "state": "closed", "title": "New L1REPACK workflow for DATA with simulation of TPs (81x)", "updated_at": "1468585812", "user": "rekovic"}

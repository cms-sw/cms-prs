The main benefit is to be able to generate the workflow configurations.\r\n\r\nTested in CMSSW_10_1_X_2018-02-26-2300, no changes expected in standard workflows.\r\n\r\n@mdhildreth @kpedro88 ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1520264347", "comments": 20, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1519747248", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "pdmv-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "d112bba9c4350e77c69a2fc2ca488e5ac813b953", "merged_at": "1520264347", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_1_X", "number": 22375, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 5, "state": "closed", "title": "Add premixing workflows for phase2", "updated_at": "1520264347", "user": "makortel"}

The main benefit is to be able to generate the workflow configurations.\r\n\r\nTested in CMSSW_10_1_X_2018-02-26-2300, no changes expected in standard workflows.\r\n\r\n@mdhildreth @kpedro88 ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 9, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1519747248", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["code-checks-pending", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "upgrade-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_1_X", "number": 22375, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 4, "state": "open", "title": "Add premixing workflows for phase2", "updated_at": "1520237064", "user": "makortel"}

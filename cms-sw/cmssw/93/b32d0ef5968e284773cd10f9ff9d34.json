The main changes are:\n- turn Cluster Charge Cut on, in its simplest form.\n- swap iterations 3 and 1 to gain speed w/o giving up in eff or fake\n- improved seeding for iteration 4, _MixedTriplets_.\n\nMost of the changes have been presented and discussed during recent TrackingPOG meetings, e.g.: \n[Link in indico](https://indico.cern.ch/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=281373), mainly talks from KevinS, GiuseppeC and GiovanniZdv.\n\n**The default tracking version is the improved one included in this pull request**.\nA customise snippet has been added in release to be able to restore the _default tracking_ as of 2012. A typical example to re-activate the _old tracking_ via a cmsDriver command is:\n\n```\ncmsDriver.py stepXYZ --step RAW2DIGI,L1Reco,RECO,DQM --conditions auto:startup ..... --customise RecoTracker/Configuration/customiseForRunI.customiseForRunI\n```\n\nExpect differences in tracking, and possibly derived objects.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 20, "closed_at": "1387214839", "comments": 16, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1386857860", "deletions": 187, "labels": ["fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "925b8d3a8ba04fa515e9beeaebdf3899170821b5", "merged_at": "1387214839", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_0_0_pre11", "number": 1785, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "Tracking cluster charge cut and new iterative sequence", "updated_at": "1387537117", "user": "rovere"}

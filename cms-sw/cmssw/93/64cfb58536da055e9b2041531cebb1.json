Need a free machine to make definitive tests.\r\n\r\nSome cleanup is still required to remove debug statements.\r\n\r\nPurely technical no regression expected.\r\n\r\nDraft Slides for a possible presentation available @ https://cernbox.cern.ch/index.php/s/Ax4NHYGLHbG8N1C\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 48, "comments": 19, "commits": 31, "created_at": "1652175312", "deletions": 574, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "alca-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-rejected", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "heterogeneous-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 37887, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "New Heterogeneous Memory Pool", "updated_at": "1652518719", "user": "VinInn"}

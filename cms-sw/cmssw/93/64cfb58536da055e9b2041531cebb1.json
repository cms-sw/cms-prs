Need a free machine to make definitive tests.\r\n\r\nSome cleanup is still required to remove debug statements.\r\n\r\nPurely technical no regression expected.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 47, "comments": 11, "commits": 30, "created_at": "1652175312", "deletions": 574, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "alca-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending", "heterogeneous-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 37887, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "New Heterogeneous Memory Pool", "updated_at": "1652241933", "user": "VinInn"}

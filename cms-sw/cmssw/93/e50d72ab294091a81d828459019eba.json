However,\n\nmany files in EventFilter/_RawToDigi still use the old, obsolete, and incorrect label \"source\", which cannot work, even for reading old data.  This means that each of these files is either unused, or the configuration is modified elsewhere to use \"rawDataCollector\".\nThis tagset fixes this bug for all EventFilter/_RawToDigi packages owned by reco.\nUse of the obsolete label \"source' is an impediment to implementing an urgent new feature to use the datamixer to mix premixed pileup stored as raw data.\nAll relvals passed in the latest 6_2_X IB with this tagset.\nI urge picking it up in 6_2_X.  It is a bug fix.\n\n--- Tagset history ---\n2013-06-07 15:20:15 - Queued by wmtan.\n2013-06-10 17:37:02 - Signed (all signatures provided) by speer.\n2013-07-03 20:34:56 - Approved by davidlt.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 21, "closed_at": "1373008359", "comments": 0, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1373008329", "deletions": 21, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "5fbb0b5166bfffd5b6cea3e7372c728d7d9e912e", "merged_at": "1373008359", "merged_by": "ktf", "number": 45, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "The module label for raw data was long ago changed from \"source\" to \"raw...", "updated_at": "1401949094", "user": "ktf"}

The problem affected (mostly) the direct simulation of PPS pixel RPs, where the simulated hit distribution was too narrow in the horizontal direction.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe following plots show a comparison before (blue) and after this PR (red dashed) for:\r\n  * Run2 reco workflow: [reco_cmp.pdf](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/files/7084752/reco_cmp.pdf) - no change as expected\r\n  * direct simulation workflow: [dirsim_cmp.pdf](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/files/7084756/dirsim_cmp.pdf) - no change for Run2, for Run3/2021 the x distribution extends to significantly larger values - as expected.\r\n\r\n[hit_dist_cmp.pdf](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/files/7084769/hit_dist_cmp.pdf) compares hit distributions at several RPs - left column (before), right (after). From the rhs column one can deduce the horizontal size of the sensors of about 16 mm which agrees with the design.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1630692502", "comments": 18, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1630414100", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["alca-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "bug-fix", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "d6d2ace70beb055cfd4348928916cd03b21474c9", "merged_at": "1630692502", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "number": 35089, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "PPS: fix of isPixelHit", "updated_at": "1630692502", "user": "jan-kaspar"}

The `std::ranges::less` requires all six comparison operators to be defined. I decided to use the three-way comparison operator as the base implementation because of why not. The equality and non-equality operators had to be defined explicitly because the three-way comparison operator is custom.\r\n\r\nMotivated by wanting to use `std::ranges::sort()` in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/48562\r\n\r\nResolves https://github.com/cms-sw/framework-team/issues/1239\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nUnit test passes\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1753888461", "comments": 12, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1753733289", "deletions": 41, "labels": ["core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved", "tests-ib-failure"], "merge_commit_sha": "ecf42da78f361aaeffdc0bef059b9a60c4a74da1", "merged_at": "1753888461", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 48643, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Make `edm::Hash` compatible with `std::ranges::less`", "updated_at": "1753888462", "user": "makortel"}

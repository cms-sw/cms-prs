New monitoring elements are added to layer-1 DQM for the 3x6x32 bits. The modification is done in such a way that it works before and after the card addition.\r\n\r\nNote that the monitoring elements for HCAL FB4-5 are commented out, we will put them back once HCAL fixes them (FB4-5 are reserved bits and not used for LLP, but they are sending unphysical data there which layer-1 could not read out, causing discrepancies seen when comparing them).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nValidated by running offline DQM on past commissioning runs, it works as expected for current production firmware. Tested with online DQM at P5 with new firmware.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/42021 is a backport of this master PR.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "comments": 15, "commits": 11, "created_at": "1687422231", "deletions": 64, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "l1-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "l1t"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_2_X", "number": 42048, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 11, "state": "open", "title": "add layer-1 monitoring for new slot-7 cards [13_2_0_pre1]", "updated_at": "1687945910", "user": "hftsoi"}

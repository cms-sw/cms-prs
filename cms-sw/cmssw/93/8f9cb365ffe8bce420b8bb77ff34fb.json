It is rebased on top of `CMSSW_14_1_0_pre2` and it's made of a single commit which squashes all the ones in #43751. Below the description and the validation of #43751 are copied and updated\r\n\r\n#### PR description:\r\n\r\nAdding the infrastructure needed to\r\n\r\n- provide the electronics to detector identifier mapping\r\n- provide the dense indexer for unpacked data and conditions (made available through EventSetup)\r\n- provide detailed information on the cell and modules (made available through EventSetup in SoAs)\r\n\r\nThe tool has been discussed in \r\n\r\n- HGCAL DPG [slides](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1358621/) and provisional documentation in [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kGKsMBQ8CWC7kJN71aJmsUv4vVDJ8ZlG_D1ColCEuAk/edit#bookmark=id.8ys9dfg99vqv) \r\n- AlCaDB [slides 1](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1372780/) [slides 2](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1386295/) \r\n- #43751\r\n\r\nIt relies on the mappings in https://github.com/cms-data/Geometry-HGCalMapping/pull/1\r\n\r\nThe requests to leave EVENTSETUP_RECORD_REG and COND_SERIALIZABLE commented are not implemented as they generate compilation errors and break the testers. The HGCAL DPG is however aware that the move to CondDB is to occur in a future time-scale (end of this year/begin on next year). \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis PR is not expected to impact any workflow thus we expect 100% success in the tests. The PR is however accompanied by a series of unit tests and analyzers (under the test) sub-directories. They have been used to validate the content produced by the new pieces of code being added to the repository.\r\n\r\n@kerstinlovisa @jalimena", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 34, "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1712933757", "deletions": 32, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "alca-pending", "db-pending", "geometry-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "upgrade-pending", "requires-external", "code-checks-approved", "hgcal"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 44729, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "HGCAL Electronics mapping (v2)", "updated_at": "1712941405", "user": "pfs"}

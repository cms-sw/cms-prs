The issue was not catch during the PR testing since the file where this error happens (`PhysicsTools/NanoAOD/plugins/TableOutputFields.cc`) is only part of ROOT6 branch.\r\n\r\nThis PR is to propose a solution by changing the type to `Int32`. As for the testing, I have created a development area with the latest ROOT6 IB to then apply these changes on top, and the module `PhysicsTools/NanoAOD` builds fine. \r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nAndrea.", "branch": "CMSSW_13_0_ROOT6_X", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 10, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1673945247", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "bug-fix", "xpog-approved"], "number": 40545, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[ROOT6] Fix int type in NanoAD plugins for ROOT6 IB", "updated_at": "1673965691", "user": "aandvalenzuela"}

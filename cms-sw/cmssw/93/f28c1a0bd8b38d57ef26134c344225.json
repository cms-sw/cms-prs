If the `EDAlias` has wildcards for one module, and more specific aliases for another module, we should use the one that has the most constrained match. There is one ambiguous case left, for which an exception is thrown. I hope we won't encounter that situation in practice.\r\n\r\nThe problem was encountered with a `SwitchProducer` having the `EDAlias` case, but I think the problem could happen also without `SwitchProducer`.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nFramework unit test passed in 12_4_8 (where I developed this change originally)", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 19, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1663281230", "deletions": 32, "labels": ["core-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-rejected", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_6_X", "number": 39409, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 4, "state": "open", "title": "Use \"best matching\" EDAlias in module dependence checks when placing ConditionalTask modules in Path", "updated_at": "1664323021", "user": "makortel"}

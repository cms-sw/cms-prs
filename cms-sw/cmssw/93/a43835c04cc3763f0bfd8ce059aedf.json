This is done in 8b2b22d0b8f1e95f073f2b8b3ce1377e6f89b6c4.\r\nChanges for making the Phase-2 HLT Validation are more extensive and will be addressed with another PR at a later time.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRun successfully `runTheMatrix.py -l 24834.0 -t 4 -j 8 --ibeos` and checked that HLT tracking plots are filled.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

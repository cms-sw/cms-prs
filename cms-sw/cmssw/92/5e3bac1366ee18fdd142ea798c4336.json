Doing this on the live config should be fine, since 8_1_0 should never go into online production, and for 2017 the new plugins are needed (and the old ones should be removed).\n- Along with this come improvements to make the Phase1 DQM actually work in online. This includes harvesting running in online and configuring the Phase1 DQM to run on Phase0 data (there is no Phase1 online yet... -- the changes only affect online). \n- The Phase1-on-Phase0 config allows testing and using the Phase1 Raw Data monitoring, so I added it here. This is really only designed and tested for Phase0, since we don't have enough information about Phase1 yet. It can already run in Phase1 offline (the records are present) but obviously there is nothing to monitor in MC.\n- There is a fairly critical bugfix for the Phase1 DQM framework. A c&p mistake in the last PR made all 2D profiles actually TH2s which is incorrect.\n\nStill to be done are specific  plots and settings for online. There might also be a memory leak in the Phase1 harvesting code which would become a problem in online, but this is hard to tell at the moment (involves `new`ed TH1s and `TH1::add`).\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 11, "closed_at": "1476270913", "comments": 18, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1475651872", "deletions": 18, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "1db44bdab496b0ad4c65fb1e2ea33e29adaabe83", "merged_at": "1476270913", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 16099, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "Phase1 Pixel DQM Online, Raw Data, and Bugfix", "updated_at": "1476385362", "user": "schneiml"}

In the emulator, if the option dropAllClustersIfMoreThanMax is used, then if any cluster is dropped in a given barrel roll or endcap chamber (because it is bigger than RpcMaxClusterSize or there is more than 2 of them) - all clusters are dropped for this roll/chamber. Besides the better data-to-emulator agreement it provides better efficiency for high pt muons. The OMTF emulator should be backward compatible with the run2 data.\r\n\r\n- what changes are expected in the output if any:\r\nbetter data-to-emulator agreement for OMTF muon trigger for the data with the OMTF firmware from Nov 2021 ([https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSLITOPS-272](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSLITOPS-272)) ,\r\nno significant changes in the data-to-emulator agreement for the run2 data.\r\n\r\n- what other PRs or externals it depends upon if any \r\nNone\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nscram b runtests - OK\r\nrunTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos - OK\r\nThe DQM was run locally in order to check the plots for showing the OMTF data-to-emulator agreement.

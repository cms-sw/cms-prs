This PR makes the code to process all `EDAlias` cases of the `SwitchProducer`, so that the `callWhenNewProductsRegistered()` that consume any of the EDAlias cases gets called early enough for the consumes information check in the `ConditionalTask` logic to work properly.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nUnit tests in `FWCore/Integration` succeed. The test case https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/36938#issuecomment-1128887595 works now as expected.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1652964590", "comments": 8, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1652903085", "deletions": 7, "labels": ["core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "bug-fix", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "1cf966f707ab199d7c63076482d859458d5c8b04", "merged_at": "1652964589", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 38006, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix behavior of SwitchProducer in ConditionalTask with non-chosen EDAlias case(s) that are consumed explicitly with callWhenNewProductsRegistered()", "updated_at": "1652964590", "user": "makortel"}

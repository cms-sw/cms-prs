This PR makes the code to process all EDAlias cases of the SwitchProducer, so that the `callWhenNewProductsRegistered()` that consume any of the EDAlias cases gets called early enough for the consumes information check in the `ConditionalTask` logic to work properly.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nUnit tests in `FWCore/Integration` succeed. The test case https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/36938#issuecomment-1128887595 works now as expected.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 4, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1652903085", "deletions": 7, "labels": ["core-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 38006, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "open", "title": "Fix behavior of SwitchProducer in ConditionalTask with non-chosen EDAlias case(s) that are consumed explicitly with callWhenNewProductsRegistered()", "updated_at": "1652960758", "user": "makortel"}

Also a digi model to simulate  the iRPCs and the new electronics is included. The digi model allows to simulate the precise timing expected to be achieved with TDC readout (to be installed for 2023 upgrade).\n\nEverything is working (both with CMSSW_8_1_0_pre5 and CMSSW_8_1_0_pre6), including also the reco step.\n\nThe code is essential for RPC upgrade studies.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 21, "closed_at": "1467741887", "comments": 40, "commits": 14, "created_at": "1465071883", "deletions": 103, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "b0e82b5d2da8e6c1bc37d2c54c2043d5ce92b991", "merged_at": "1467741887", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 14769, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Rpc and irpc digitization phase ii", "updated_at": "1467741887", "user": "bapavlov"}

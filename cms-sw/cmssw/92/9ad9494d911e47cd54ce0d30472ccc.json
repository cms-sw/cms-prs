This pull request renames the overloaded non-const functions to something more descriptive, usually beginning with \"set\" or \"insert\".\nNOTE:  This pull request does not affect DQM at all.  The marking of DQM as required was due to an extraneous file in the first push.  Unfortunately, correcting the push does not remove the obsolete signature requirement.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 10, "closed_at": "1373957195", "comments": 4, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1373893157", "deletions": 77, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "core-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "24bb64dd4b4e13cf30de523b10b04d63dde32342", "merged_at": "1373957195", "merged_by": "ktf", "number": 104, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Use set functions", "updated_at": "1406835017", "user": "wmtan"}

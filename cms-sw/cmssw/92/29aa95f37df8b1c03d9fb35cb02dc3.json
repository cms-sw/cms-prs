While #19587 achieves the intended physics behavior, it unnecessarily kept particles below the PUPPI weight threshold. By changing the order of the applied cuts, those are removed.\r\nThe expected behavior is a reduction of the number of jet constituents for PUPPI jets in MiniAOD, all of them with weight <1% such that the physics performance, i.e. puppi jet momenta do not change signficantly.\r\nThe MiniAOD size is reduced (200 ttbar events without PU) as follows:\r\n\r\nbefore\r\npatJets_slimmedJetsPuppi__PAT. 15985.9 2209.08\r\npatJets_slimmedJetsAK8__PAT. 6065.2 1313.88\r\n\r\nafter\r\npatJets_slimmedJetsPuppi__PAT. 15393.1 2140.67\r\npatJets_slimmedJetsAK8__PAT. 5996.57 1303.97", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 0, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1524148262", "deletions": 2, "labels": [], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 23012, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Remove low weight PUPPI particles", "updated_at": "1524148317", "user": "ahinzmann"}

It can be used for both miniAOD production and MET reprocessing on top of miniAOD.\nNew features :\n- new pat::MET format,, takes benefit of the additional MET properties (for both corrections and uncertainties)\n- 74X backward compatibility, the pat::MET format is able to read the 74X MET format and reprocess the 74X MET in 75X with e.g. new JEC. The 74X pat::MET content is empty with a 75X production.\n- ME phi correction new code implemented, corrections are stored in pat::MET and can be reprocessed on top of the miniAOD\n- type0 MET correction stored\n- smeared MET correction stored (not up to date! still 8 TeV smearing, kept for experts)\n- preparation for storage of the MET significance in miniAOD (currently not enabled per default)\n- Type2 MET discarded, not supported for an analysis use\n- added warning when negative JEC corrections are used in Type1MET computation\n\nExpected changes in performances : \n- size of pat::MET should be smaller than before (less uncertainty variables stored)\n- no change in MET contents, physics observables are the same\n- could be a bit faster than the previous tool (less modules called), but not checked\n\nPackages changed : \n- DataFormats/PatCandidates\n- JetMETCorrections/Type1MET\n- PhysicsTools/PatAlgos\n- PhysicsTools/PatUtils\n\n@arizzi @gpetruc, you may want to check the performances on miniAODs, let me know if you request modifications or extra checks\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 40, "closed_at": "1435550784", "comments": 46, "commits": 16, "created_at": "1431764736", "deletions": 3299, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "814df5d469c87c1df9a2210c2fcae379b995be9b", "merged_at": "1435550784", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 9117, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 17, "state": "closed", "title": "New MET correction/uncertainty tool", "updated_at": "1479106152", "user": "mmarionncern"}

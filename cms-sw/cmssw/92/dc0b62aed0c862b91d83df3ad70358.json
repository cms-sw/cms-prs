This corresponds to the phase 2 outer tracker as currently implemented.  This will not be migrated to 7X as the outer tracker will no longer be based on the pixel digitizer.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1404465371", "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1404085438", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "06fa2d50540373cca80d038381c279b6461041ea", "merged_at": "1404465371", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "number": 4443, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "binary pixel readout for barrel gt 4 or endcap gt 10", "updated_at": "1404465371", "user": "stensokm"}

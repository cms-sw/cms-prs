A drop in signal efficiency at eta > 1.5 (EE) was observed and unexpected. That was linked to the bug fixed in this PR: the dnn_sig node was used instead of dnn_bkg to perform an additional cut, causing the drop in efficiency. The bug was affecting only the endcap part of the electron selection. \r\n\r\n[1] https://cernbox.cern.ch/index.php/s/3asr0DrAqx6zdFD\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1638345870", "comments": 12, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1638260332", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "bug-fix", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "82cd15cfb838e678bf8828a8ed76e7bc4351cd5f", "merged_at": "1638345870", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_2_X", "number": 36292, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Bugfix for Egamma PFID with DNNs", "updated_at": "1638345871", "user": "valsdav"}

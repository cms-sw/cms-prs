Some of our code was sensitive to the changes in the headers, and caused the `abs` function to not be the one we expected, so it was returning integers instead of floats. We switched to `std::abs` to fix the issue, following modern guidelines.\r\n\r\nWe also fixed a miscounting that randomly happened and a potential out of bounds access.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "comments": 12, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1740578048", "deletions": 30, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved", "heterogeneous-approved", "tracking"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 47461, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "open", "title": "Minor fixes to LST standalone code", "updated_at": "1740670856", "user": "ariostas"}

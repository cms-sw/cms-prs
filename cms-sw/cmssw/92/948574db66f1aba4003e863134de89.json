It's over 10 years old. Today, people either use TVMA outside of CMSSW on NanoAOD or private \"ntuples\" or go for machine learning in the python ecosystem.\r\n\r\nThe only code where the MVATrainer is referenced to in CMSSW is located in the TopQuarkAnalysis subsystem, which seems to be abandoned itself so I suppose removing the code where the MVATrainer is referenced there does not do any harm.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? Who is responsible for this package now? Is it maybe still used by someone?\r\n\r\n[1] https://indico.cern.ch/event/25702/contributions/575840/attachments/451161/625567/plenary-b-tag.pdf\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCMSSW compiles and local matrix tests pass.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\n\r\nNo backport intended.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 98, "closed_at": "1568311672", "comments": 37, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1566987166", "deletions": 35117, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "33256adc16f3fd8aa73ed6fc0ab7b1d2d0a5e8f8", "merged_at": "1568311672", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27888, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Removing the PhysicsTools/MVATrainer package", "updated_at": "1569219072", "user": "guitargeek"}

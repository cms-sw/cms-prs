At 1TeV this was introducing a ~1% scale shift in the barrel and a ~10% scale shift in the endcap.\n\nLikely issue is limited kinematic coverage of training sample combined with tails in the energy response distribution sufficiently large to create well-populated BDT bins in the region about the kinematic limit of the sample, where all photons are by construction overmeasured (and therefore overcorrected downwards in energy)\n\n@bachtis @lgray @matteosan1\n\n@konush can you incorporate this change into your evaluation scripts and run the validation plots again to make sure this doesn't introduce any strange behaviour in scale/resolution vs eta/pt?  (at least up to the kinematic limit in the present samples...)\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1430885063", "comments": 28, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1430737362", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "d2d49d62023e05e74264132c57060347e81a5f43", "merged_at": "1430885063", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 8949, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix for high energy behaviour of ecal pfcluster corrections", "updated_at": "1430885063", "user": "bendavid"}

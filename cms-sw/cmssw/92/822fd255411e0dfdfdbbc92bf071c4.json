In this PR, the newly introduced 120X Run 3 Prompt GT has a new such tag, EcalLaserAPDPNRatiosRcd, that is only valid starting from Run3 data. It was discussed and agreed upon also with the Ecal group.\r\n\r\nIn summary, the Run 3 Prompt GTs introduced in this PR are only valid for Run 3 data.\r\n\r\nGT differences wrt CRUZET ones:\r\nHLT:\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/113X_dataRun3_HLT_v3/120X_dataRun3_HLT_v3\r\nExpress:\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/113X_dataRun3_Express_v4/120X_dataRun3_Express_v2\r\nPrompt:\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/113X_dataRun3_Prompt_v3/120X_dataRun3_Prompt_v2\r\n\r\nThe hypernews with the announcement of the Pilot Test Beam GTs is here: https://hypernews.cern.ch/HyperNews/CMS/get/calibrations/4488.html\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nJust as a sanity check as we do not expect to catch the errors that showed up in DQM online:\r\n\r\nrunTheMatrix.py -l 138.1,138.2 --ibeos -j8 \r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nIt is a forward port of #35561.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1634079610", "comments": 26, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1633714672", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["alca-approved", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "requires-external", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "7fc432b9b59246ea132a59f7b5959ec38017a54c", "merged_at": "1634079609", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "number": 35593, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "[121X] include GTs for Pilot Beam Test", "updated_at": "1634079610", "user": "malbouis"}

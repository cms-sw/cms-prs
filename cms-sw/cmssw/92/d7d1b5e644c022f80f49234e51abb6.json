Usual tests have been made. Neither runtime performance nor event size are compromised as expected. We have checked that the variable is indeed written to file. The modification has been communicated to the miniAOD officers and those have notified the PPD. \n\nCheers,\nRoger\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": "1475126919", "comments": 8, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1474967333", "deletions": 10, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved", "urgent"], "merge_commit_sha": "f04bbb48d029d76f404c7e5a645be69169d103a9", "merged_at": "1475126919", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 15995, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Adding missing variable to be able to run the anti-electron discriminator on present trainings", "updated_at": "1487932769", "user": "roger-wolf"}

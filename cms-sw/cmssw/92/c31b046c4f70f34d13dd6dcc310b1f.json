It does not work on *all* root files, but, among others, DQMIO and legacy DQM output. Nontrivial queries are IMO much easier on SQLite than ROOT data...\r\n\r\n-  `dqmiodatasetharvest.py` demonstrates how to read MEs from DQMIO data available via DAS. It is not supposed to be a general tool, but with minor changes it can be used for operations like historic DQM. It _does_ exploit the fact that DQMIO data is saved per job, and therefore per-lumisection granularity data is available in prompt RECO output. It also contains code to convert the resulting file back into a `TTree`, but this is not done automatically.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nNo existing code is affected. The tools have proven useful in my daily work.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 5, "commits": 9, "created_at": "1554292612", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "dqm-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-started"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 26337, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "DQMIO-related tools", "updated_at": "1554293374", "user": "schneiml"}

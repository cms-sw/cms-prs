In particular, `size_` has been deleted from `SoAParametersImpl`.\r\n\r\nWhen CUDA 13.1 is released, it will be possible to add `size_` for other purposes, and the bug should be fixed (since a bug report has been opened and closed).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nWorkflows 12834.402 and 29661.402 work.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1761713979", "comments": 32, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1757084453", "deletions": 10, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved", "heterogeneous-approved", "tracking", "allow-leobeltra"], "merge_commit_sha": "6a7bc96280b95909d390d3a840e6f4f6aabdf56c", "merged_at": "1761713979", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_16_0_X", "number": 48854, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "Removed workaround for illegal memory access", "updated_at": "1761713980", "user": "leobeltra"}

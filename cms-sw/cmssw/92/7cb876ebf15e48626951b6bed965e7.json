In particular, `size_` has been deleted from `SoAParametersImpl`.\r\n\r\nWhen CUDA 13.1 is released, it will be possible to add `size_` for other purposes, and the bug should be fixed (since a bug report has been opened and closed).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nWorkflows 12834.402 and 29661.402 work.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1757084453", "deletions": 11, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending", "heterogeneous-pending", "tracking", "allow-leobeltra"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 48854, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "open", "title": "Removed workaround for illegal memory access", "updated_at": "1757162425", "user": "leobeltra"}

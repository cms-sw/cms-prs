It is possible to do this by requiring an additional bit that is exclusively PNet or DeepTau.\r\nIn the process of implementing the PNet bits, several non-functioning DeepTau bits were also updated, enabling more Tau triggers to be matched, specifically VBF SingleTau.\r\n\r\nThe changes were tested by re-emulating signal files from the HLT decision to NanoAOD, and then observing the filter bits at the NanoAOD level.\r\n\r\nThis PR is a backport of #44688. The backport is necessary because 14_0_X is the release that will be used during proton-proton data-taking, and the filter bit changes are necessary for smooth Tau Trigger operation during proton-proton collisions.\r\n\r\nhead PR: https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/44688\r\nintended release cycle: 14_0_X\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 10, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1712738107", "deletions": 33, "labels": ["fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "backport", "xpog-approved", "tau"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "number": 44690, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Updated Tau Filterbits for 2024 Data Taking [Backport]", "updated_at": "1712755308", "user": "brallmond"}

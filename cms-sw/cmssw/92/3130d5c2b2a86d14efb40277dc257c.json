In\r\nparticular failing unit test we had 1 run thus\r\n`runControlNumbers_.size()` was 1. Then we tried to access\r\n`runControlNumbers_[1]` which was out-of-bounds.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: David Abdurachmanov <David.Abdurachmanov@cern.ch>", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1510646186", "comments": 15, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1510467901", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "71c70308aad7fc8f449b151c36d4fedac191a720", "merged_at": "1510646186", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_0_X", "number": 21284, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 5, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix range-based loop for runControlNumbers_", "updated_at": "1510646186", "user": "davidlt"}

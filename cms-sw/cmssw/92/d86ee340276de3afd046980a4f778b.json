Might need to be updated in the future as GE2/1 geometry gets fine-tuned.\r\n* option to run on `GEMPadDigiClusters` is introduced\r\n* usage of `CSCTriggerGeometry` is completely removed in the CSC trigger. Instead, the ALCT/CLCT processor now use the `CSCGeometry`. `CSCTriggerGeometry` is still used in various places in CMSSW (e.g. CSCTF, DQM).\r\n* `CSCTriggerPrimitivesBuilder` is a local `unique_ptr` of the `CSCTriggerPrimitivesProducer`\r\n* some functions in `CSCMotherBoard` have been made `const` \r\n* `GEMCoPadProcessor` has functionality to create copads out of two pads in different rolls. parameters for GE11 and GE21 are in separate psets now\r\n* This PR should only affect Phase-2 workflows\r\n\r\n@tahuang1991 please check", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 42, "closed_at": "1512464106", "comments": 98, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1505354016", "deletions": 6105, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "78a797a46a83721d8571bcf954088127f010a183", "merged_at": "1512464106", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_0_X", "number": 20509, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 57, "state": "closed", "title": "GEM-CSC local trigger: make ME11 and ME21 TMBs inherit from same base class", "updated_at": "1512744409", "user": "dildick"}

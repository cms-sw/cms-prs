However, if the class in question is an instance of an STL container, the base classes, if any, do not have dictionaries, and a segfault results due to a null pointer dereference.\nThis pull request simply suppresses the search for base classes of STL containers.  This search was unnecessary anyway, since ROOT understands STL containers.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_ROOT6_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1394478500", "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1394477621", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["db-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "3c30c17e344df82f58ae48fcb443c1db850df5e3", "merged_at": "1394478500", "merged_by": "davidlt", "number": 2798, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Don't look at base classes of STL containers", "updated_at": "1394564117", "user": "wmtan"}

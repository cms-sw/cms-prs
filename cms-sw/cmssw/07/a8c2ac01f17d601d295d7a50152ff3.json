SparseReadCache implements the complicated cache-switching logic used by default.  SimpleCache implements a simplified version of the caching logic from #48088 that allows use of TTree::GetEntry.\r\n\r\nSimplification of the simple caching case results in an improved IO profile.  By factoring out the two use cases, this also provides a better base for future modifications (especially to the simple caching case).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested on an AOD to MINIAOD production job similar to the one used for validation of #48088.  A limited matrix test job was also run.  This is a purely technical change to the ROOT file input system, no changes are expected in physics results.\r\n\r\nresolves https://github.com/cms-sw/framework-team/issues/126", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1762201677", "comments": 48, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1758556483", "deletions": 356, "labels": ["core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved", "tests-external-failure"], "merge_commit_sha": "d8546e2b0d2b69cd144a254d0a1c54336d4fcb1f", "merged_at": "1762201677", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_16_0_X", "number": 48969, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 17, "state": "closed", "title": "PoolSource TTreeCache refactoring", "updated_at": "1762201678", "user": "dan131riley"}

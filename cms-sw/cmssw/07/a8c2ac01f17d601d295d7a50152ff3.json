SparseReadCache implements the complicated cache-switching logic used by default.  SimpleCache implements a simplified version of the caching logic from #48088 that allows use of TTree::GetEntry, and additionally enables the use of the TTreeCacheUnzip parallel unzipping feature.\r\n\r\nSimplification of the simple caching case and adding parallel decompression results in an improved IO profile.  By factoring out the two use cases, this also provides a better base for future modifications (especially to the simple caching case).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested on an AOD to MINIAOD production job similar to the one used for validation of #48088.  A limited matrix test job is also in progress.  This is a purely technical change to the ROOT file input system, no changes are expected in physics results.\r\n\r\nresolves https://github.com/cms-sw/framework-team/issues/126", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "comments": 4, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1758556483", "deletions": 346, "labels": ["core-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_0_X", "number": 48969, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 6, "state": "open", "title": "PoolSource TTreeCache refactoring", "updated_at": "1758561959", "user": "dan131riley"}

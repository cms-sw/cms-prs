SparseReadCache implements the complicated cache-switching logic used by default.  SimpleCache implements a simplified version of the caching logic from #48088 that allows use of TTree::GetEntry.\r\n\r\nSimplification of the simple caching case results in an improved IO profile.  By factoring out the two use cases, this also provides a better base for future modifications (especially to the simple caching case).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested on an AOD to MINIAOD production job similar to the one used for validation of #48088.  A limited matrix test job was also run.  This is a purely technical change to the ROOT file input system, no changes are expected in physics results.\r\n\r\nresolves https://github.com/cms-sw/framework-team/issues/126", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "comments": 14, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1758556483", "deletions": 347, "labels": ["core-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_0_X", "number": 48969, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 15, "state": "open", "title": "PoolSource TTreeCache refactoring", "updated_at": "1759183239", "user": "dan131riley"}

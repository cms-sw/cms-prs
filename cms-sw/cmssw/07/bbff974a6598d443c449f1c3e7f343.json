The prescale index is currently passes the \"sample\" operation to hltd and the transfer system so the latter will take it from a random file. The functionality to compare across all files and verify that it is the same is not currently present, although this is done in the CMSSW code so at least if it changes for the same process, we will know.\n\nThere were also a few changes to clean up the code and remove some ambiguities. The iSummary variables are now explicitly initialized at the beginning of each lumi section. Also, L1Accept is now L1AlgoAccept to clarify that this is for the algorithm bits only rather than all bits.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1433499197", "comments": 18, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1432746044", "deletions": 78, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "hlt-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "a669ef4bdfe9e0722b357930a1b28e67c283b15b", "merged_at": "1433499197", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 9301, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "Adding prescale index and L1 tables with per-type data", "updated_at": "1433499197", "user": "avetisya"}

Add premixing variations for Run 3 FastSim in the upgrade matrix.\r\n2. Remove some spurious workflows:\r\n    a. Some special workflow modifications get applied without actually changing any steps, leading to a pointless clone of the main workflow. These can just be filtered out globally.\r\n    b. A few special workflows were being applied to all fragments unnecessarily. I have restricted these to just ttbar. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n1. Checked the list of workflows in the upgrade matrix and the steps that they contain.\r\n2. Ran the new FastSim premixing workflows successfully.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nThis will be backported to 14_0_X for profiling in the production release.\r\n\r\nattn: @sbein @srimanob ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 26, "commits": 8, "created_at": "1726488653", "deletions": 59, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_2_X", "number": 46007, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 6, "state": "open", "title": "FastSim premixing workflows and matrix cleanup", "updated_at": "1728000983", "user": "kpedro88"}

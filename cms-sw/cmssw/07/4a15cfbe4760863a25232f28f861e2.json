Instead, use a `ProcessCallGraph` to get the highest possible module id.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nWith these changes, adding the `NVProfilerService` to complex configurations (_e.g._ a full HLT menu) works, instead of failing with an assertion.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nAlmost verbatim backport of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/43141 to 13.2.X for the sake of completing  [CMSALCA-240](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSALCA-240). The small difference w.r.t to master are deriving from some missing empty lines not backported.\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_13_2_X", "changed_files": 11, "comments": 6, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1699436321", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["operations-pending", "dqm-approved", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "pdmv-approved", "backport", "upgrade-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_2_X", "number": 43222, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[13.2.X] customize HLT offline DQM for Run3 PbPb and introduce HI 2023A relval workflow (with reHLT)", "updated_at": "1699456806", "user": "mmusich"}

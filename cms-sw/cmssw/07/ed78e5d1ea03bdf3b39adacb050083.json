Studies here show that this iteration is only recovering 1-2% efficiency, while also contributing ~1% fake rate.  A small tracking region for pixel layers 1 and 4, and forward pixel disk 1 has been kept to cover a gap in acceptance of BPIX2 and 3 (very similar to this pp PR: #19051). \r\n\r\nTiming studies show an overall decrease in tracking time in 0-10% events from ~109 s to ~99 s, and from 10.3 to 9.7s in inclusive events.\r\n\r\nTesting can be done using the HI Phase 1 relval proposed in PR #19089.\r\n@mandrenguyen", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1499265614", "comments": 15, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1498742827", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "60d850386dc9ba212ac53af40adeaabf672e1812", "merged_at": "1499265614", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_3_X", "number": 19486, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Modification of Pixel Pair Step in HI Tracking", "updated_at": "1499265614", "user": "abaty"}

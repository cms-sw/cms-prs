Once it's updated, those sections can be removed without any effect on the code.\r\n\r\nThe dasgoclient makes `validateAlignments.py -c testValidate.ini -N testValidate -n` a factor of 3 faster.  I checked that we get equivalent behavior with either the new or the old clients.\r\n\r\nhttps://hypernews.cern.ch/HyperNews/CMS/get/sw-develtools/2504.html", "branch": "CMSSW_9_2_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1499367530", "comments": 9, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1499164367", "deletions": 29, "labels": ["alca-approved", "backport", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "fb5a0fb8d17679a39fd4dc3395f62f408cd5a211", "merged_at": "1499367530", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_2_X", "number": 19540, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Tracker alignment validation das client", "updated_at": "1499794076", "user": "hroskes"}

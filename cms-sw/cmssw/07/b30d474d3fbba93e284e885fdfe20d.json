No major changes are proposed. One dd4hep cfi file is updated to contain a link to the latest dd4hep geometry (now v4).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nGeometry dump script confirms no error related to the reco geometry. PPS direct simulation confirms no change in the geometry. Script to produce DB payload for DDD and dd4hep used to confirm no issues with the list of XML files.

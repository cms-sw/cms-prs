This allows acessing data in the final precision for performance studies and ML model training\r\n   - modify the `PFCluster` data-format to store digitized objects in packed format. This allows retrieving quantized quantities in the ntuplization steps\r\n- adds more realistic HGCal decoding (update to more recent interface document)\r\n   - add emulation of new multiclass ID within the HGCal decoding step\r\n- PFCandidate ref to source becomes polymorphic, allowing uniform interface across barrel and endcap \r\n- GCT EM and Hadronic emulated objects are now decoded and calibrated within the emulator\r\n- updated emulator of the barrel \"TDR\" regionizer\r\n- flexible packed binary format of calorimeter and track objects across barrel and edncap to optimize Firmware resource usage\r\n\r\n\r\ne-gamma L1T:\r\n- adds new composite ID model for the barrel cluster to track matching for building TkElectrons\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nWe will soon post some comparison plots. \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 59, "comments": 26, "commits": 37, "created_at": "1746194720", "deletions": 981, "labels": ["l1-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-approved", "changes-dataformats"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 48002, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 26, "state": "open", "title": "[L1T] Restructure handling of Calorimeter input to Correlator Layer-1 + new TkElectrons in barrel (Phase-2)", "updated_at": "1747252354", "user": "cerminar"}

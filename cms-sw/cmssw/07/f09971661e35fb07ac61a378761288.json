It should fix the [#39362 (comment)](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/39362#issuecomment-2666480839) from the CMSSW side (we still have a bunch of folders with no plots under `HLT/Muon/Efficiency_Layout`, but those are produced by the DQM GUI). \r\nNo physics changes are expected, in Phase 2 DQM files there should be one folder for each HLT Muon path currently present in the menu under `HLT/Muon/Distributions`\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI've produced a DQM file with 200 events from workflow 29850 (ZMM 200PU) to verify that the `Distributions` plots are filled correctly. The file is available [here](https://cernbox.cern.ch/s/K1fzE6AcW5p2law).\r\n\r\nFYI @mtosi @BlancoFS ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1742917828", "deletions": 12, "labels": ["dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "ngt"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 47689, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[NGT] Fix HLT Muon paths for Phase 2 Validation", "updated_at": "1743401595", "user": "Parsifal-2045"}

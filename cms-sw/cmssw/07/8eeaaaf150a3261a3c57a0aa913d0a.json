The 3D clustering is now OFF by default and is enabled by telling cmsDriver:\n\n```\n--customise SLHCUpgradeSimulations/Configuration/customise_PFlow.customise_use3DHCalClusters\n```\n\nNote that if using the \"--command\" method to add this to runTheMatrix I think it doesn't apply the original customise for the geometry, so that has to be specified as well.  E.g. for 102xx the normal customisation would be SLHCUpgradeSimulations/Configuration/combinedCustoms.cust_2019.  So to run the 102xx matrix tests with 3D clustering:\n\n```\nrunTheMatrix.py -w upgrade -l 10261 --command \"--customise SLHCUpgradeSimulations/Configuration/combinedCustoms.cust_2019,SLHCUpgradeSimulations/Configuration/customise_PFlow.customise_use3DHCalClusters\"\n```\n\n@lgray could you check over this and make sure I've merged all the conflicts properly, and implemented the customisation function properly?\nIn particular I had some merge conflicts in RecoParticleFlow/Configuration/python/RecoParticleFlow_EventContent_cff.py so that should be checked.  I also had to add some code to RecoParticleFlow/PFClusterProducer/interface/PFRecHitQTests.h to get it to compile.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "changed_files": 47, "closed_at": "1404364070", "comments": 10, "commits": 37, "created_at": "1404248991", "deletions": 75, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "cbcbf5a33d06a59b42289cdd4769592b8a1e1c07", "merged_at": "1404364070", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "number": 4483, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "Rebase #4384 and add customisation function", "updated_at": "1404378726", "user": "mark-grimes"}

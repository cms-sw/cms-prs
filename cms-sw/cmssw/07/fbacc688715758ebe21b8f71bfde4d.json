This ID is not supported anymore and we only noticed it during the preparation of the Fall17 V2 ID backport to 9_4_X. It is not enabled by default, that's why we didn't catch this in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/24131.\r\n\r\nEven thought it's a deprecated ID, I think it's not appropriate to let it break in the 10_3_0 release in this ungraceful way, so I hope I'm still in time...\r\n\r\nMy personal validation workflow shows now agreement of the Spring15 photon MVAs between this PR and 9_4_9.\r\n\r\nJonas", "branch": "CMSSW_10_3_X", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": "1540574121", "comments": 20, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1539688947", "deletions": 7, "labels": ["backport-ok", "bug-fix", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "6db48fb9f3168a2f63435a0b7d3fe0e430104eda", "merged_at": "1540574121", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_3_X", "number": 24890, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "[10_3_X] Fixed copy-paste typo in Spring15 photon MVA weight file names", "updated_at": "1540574121", "user": "guitargeek"}

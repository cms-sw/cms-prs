The tests have been performed using a sample of 8900 events.\r\n- A perfect agreement with the CUDA code has been achieved. A small deviation of the order of e(-22) on the mean has been observed when comparing the reconstructed amplitudes of Alpaka GPU code with the CPU, which fits the observations from the other studies. A perfect agreement of the Portable CPU with the native CPU has additionally been observed.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 8, "comments": 27, "commits": 12, "created_at": "1737118172", "deletions": 40, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "heterogeneous-pending", "ecal"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 47124, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 44, "state": "open", "title": "Ecal Phase2 Weights-based Reconstruction, Alpaka integration", "updated_at": "1743682178", "user": "Jakub-Gajownik"}

These plots have been separated for each station for clarity.\r\nBugfix for Residual Plots: The residual plots are being filled even when there was no hit on the GEM to match the track to. This misrepresented the actual entry number. With this PR, filling occurs only when a hit is present.\r\nCode Cleanup: Removed unnecessary parts of the code.\r\nLegend Update: Legends have been updated for better clarity.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nValidation was performed using the command runTheMatrix.py -l 24450.0 -w upgrade. We verified that the plots after the PR reflect all the changes listed above.\r\n\r\n@jshlee @watson-ij ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 8, "closed_at": "1692767699", "comments": 2, "commits": 20, "created_at": "1692763188", "deletions": 353, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-rejected", "tracking"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_3_X", "number": 42637, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fixes and modifications on GEM TnP efficiency plots", "updated_at": "1692767699", "user": "jo100sun"}

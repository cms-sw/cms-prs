Now that the MVA framework is rewritten in a flexible way, there wouldn't have been any reason to delete old IDs a few months ago.\r\n\r\n* Started to improve `PhotonIDValueMapProducer.cc` since it became slow and difficult to maintain. I spotted for example the bug that https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/RecoEgamma/PhotonIdentification/plugins/PhotonIDValueMapProducer.cc#L496 and https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/RecoEgamma/PhotonIdentification/plugins/PhotonIDValueMapProducer.cc#L507 calculate exactly the same thing.\r\n\r\n* Config file for actual Fall17 V2 PhotonMVA will follow later after validation within Egamma.\r\n\r\n__Has to be tested with__ https://github.com/cms-sw/cmsdist/pull/4230.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 30, "comments": 8, "commits": 12, "created_at": "1532953987", "deletions": 916, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "requires-external", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_3_X", "number": 24131, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Preparing RecoEgamma_PhotonIdentification for Fall17 V2 MVA ID", "updated_at": "1532970298", "user": "guitargeek"}

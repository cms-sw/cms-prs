I spotted for example the bug that https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/RecoEgamma/PhotonIdentification/plugins/PhotonIDValueMapProducer.cc#L496 and https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/RecoEgamma/PhotonIdentification/plugins/PhotonIDValueMapProducer.cc#L507 calculate exactly the same thing.\r\n\r\n* Config file for actual Fall17 V2 PhotonMVA will follow later after validation within Egamma.\r\n\r\n* Some technical improvements.\r\n\r\n__Has to be tested with__ https://github.com/cms-sw/cmsdist/pull/4230.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 33, "closed_at": "1534013100", "comments": 60, "commits": 12, "created_at": "1532953987", "deletions": 1061, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "orp-approved", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "requires-external", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "42c4f69ed901ff8631d151956f83ebe934bade2c", "merged_at": "1534013100", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_3_X", "number": 24131, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 29, "state": "closed", "title": "Preparing RecoEgamma_PhotonIdentification for Fall17 V2 MVA ID", "updated_at": "1534013107", "user": "guitargeek"}

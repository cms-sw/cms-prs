Should probably move CosmicTrackingParticleSelector.h, TrackingParticleSelector.cc and TrackingParticleRefSelector.cc to SimGeneral/TrackingAnalysis at some point in the future for consistency, but that will require switching namespaces and probably needs some discussion.  I was told this was an urgent fix for 6.2.x so created this pull request for just TrackingParticleSelector.h for now.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_6_2_X", "changed_files": 14, "closed_at": "1378119687", "comments": 12, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1376568882", "deletions": 116, "labels": ["dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "542f74110bfaa2a414d63bb72e3e2c19eeffb3e1", "merged_at": "1378119687", "merged_by": "davidlt", "milestone": "CMSSW_6_2_2", "number": 544, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Move TrackingParticleSelector to SimGeneral/TrackingAnalysis", "updated_at": "1379055659", "user": "kknb1056"}

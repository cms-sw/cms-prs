The solution is to subtract 1 from `layer` while filling the histograms. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nValidated by running DQM on recent data. The plots are filled correctly for layers 1 and 2 after the fix.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nWe can backport this to 14_1_X to fix the problem during the HI run as well.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 4, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1730379353", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_2_X", "number": 46568, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Bugfix for EMTF DQM module", "updated_at": "1730379941", "user": "eyigitba"}

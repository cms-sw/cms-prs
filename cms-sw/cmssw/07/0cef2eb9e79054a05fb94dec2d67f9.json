All the energies are still stored in the userFloats but the user will have to manually apply them in their analysis. \r\n\r\nThis was made in the interests of allowing at least something to proceed into the re-miniAOD. At this point the PR reduces to 2 new producers which make ValueMaps which then get loaded into the pat::Electron and pat::Photon by existing mechanisms, vastly simplifying the implications of the PR\r\n\r\nWe can decide which of these two PRs goes through, obviously they are mutually exclusive.

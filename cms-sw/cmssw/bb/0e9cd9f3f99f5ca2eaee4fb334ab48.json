The number of events in the selection is still fairly large (1428) for PR-like or even somewhat longer tests.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if the LS selection in relval_steps.py directly applies to relval submission, where more events may be needed. However, it's very likely that we will not run relvals for this data (I see that the last `/HIMinBiasUPC/CMSSW_*/DQMIO` was in 11_1_0)\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1636197570", "comments": 13, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1635510407", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["fully-signed", "tests-rejected", "pdmv-approved", "orp-approved", "upgrade-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "f1f244d0cb1b26655d688c3bef9a38e588897bd7", "merged_at": "1636197569", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_2_X", "number": 35912, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "restrict RunHI2011 to 182124:40, used in the short matrix wf 140.53", "updated_at": "1636197570", "user": "slava77"}

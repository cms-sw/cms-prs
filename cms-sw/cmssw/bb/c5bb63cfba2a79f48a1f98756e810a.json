User can also choose to only run a single producer with just, say, the prompt tracks. Doesn't require that both be run. Example config (includes running and ntuplizer): L1Trigger/TrackFindingTracklet/test/L1TrackObjectNtupleMaker_cfg.py\r\n\r\nMerged the two-layer jets (L1Trigger/TwoLayerJets) into the L1TTrackMatch directory, and renamed them L1TrackJets, since they are the main track jets produced, and the ones used in the TDR. The fast track jet producer has been renamed L1TrackFastJets, which is useful for comparisons.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRebase of https://github.com/cms-l1t-offline/cmssw/pull/857 and https://github.com/cms-l1t-offline/cmssw/pull/860\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nRebase of https://github.com/cms-l1t-offline/cmssw/pull/857 and https://github.com/cms-l1t-offline/cmssw/pull/860", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 12, "closed_at": "1620898076", "comments": 28, "commits": 10, "created_at": "1620312044", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "f00af7adb7bba147fe425e692b5ca7236b278f51", "merged_at": "1620898076", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "number": 33651, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 6, "state": "closed", "title": "L1T Phase-2: add various L1 Tk objects", "updated_at": "1620898077", "user": "cecilecaillol"}

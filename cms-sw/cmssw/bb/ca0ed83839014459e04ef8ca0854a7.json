The older TMBs (ME1/3, ME1234/2) are based on Virtex-2 (XC2V4000). Presently, the logic resources are so strained that we have to simplify parts of the CCLUT algorithm in order to fit. \r\n\r\nTo this end we're developing **CCLUT Version 2.0**. Two changes are made to reduce the resource usage: \r\n* The 9-bit quality word is removed from the LUT. This word is actually not even used in the simulation. Nor is it used in firmware. So it was basically an empty 9-bit word. This reduces the size of the result space from 18 bits to 9 bits. \r\n* In addition, we're adding 11-bit hit patterns (as opposed to 12-bit patterns). See https://github.com/cms-data/L1Trigger-CSCTriggerPrimitives/pull/12. This reduces the size of the LUT by half.\r\n\r\nThe code is not enabled yet, and will be tested with the B904 ME1/1, ME2/1 and ME4/2 test-stand in the coming weeks.\r\n\r\nOnce #34779 is merged, I will make an update so that the `CSCL1TPLookupTableEP` producer module loads the text files for `CSCL1TPLookupTableCCLUT` from the correct directory.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles. No LUTs for simulation are affected. There should be no change in any workflow.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nBefore submitting your pull requests, make sure you followed this checklist:\r\n- verify that the PR is really intended for the chosen branch\r\n- verify that changes follow [CMS Naming, Coding, And Style Rules](http://cms-sw.github.io/cms_coding_rules.html)\r\n- verify that the PR passes the basic test procedure suggested in the [CMSSW PR instructions](https://cms-sw.github.io/PRWorkflow.html)\r\n\r\n@tahuang1991 ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 12, "comments": 23, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1628092811", "deletions": 64, "labels": ["simulation-pending", "l1-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "number": 34780, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "CCLUT version 2.0 for the Run-3 CSC trigger (CCLUT-18)", "updated_at": "1631363996", "user": "dildick"}

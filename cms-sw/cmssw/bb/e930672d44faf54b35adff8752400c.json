The output collections are of the same data type as the TDR (previous version) non-firmware-based Phase 2 emulator, namely l1t::EGamma, l1tp2::CaloCrystalClusters, and 1tp2::CaloTower. \r\n\r\nSome firmware-style code is refacored into abstracted functions and classes, compared to the firmware. \r\n\r\nThis PR also corresponds to [PR#1069 to cms-l1t-offline](https://github.com/cms-l1t-offline/cmssw/pull/1069). \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nEfficiencies and rates for the EG clusters produced in the firmware-based emulator are [compared](https://github.com/cms-l1t-offline/cmssw/pull/1069#issuecomment-1479547259) with the previous TDR emulator. \r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

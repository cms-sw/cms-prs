The fix was applied in 76X by re-running the Taus at the miniAOD step. This pull request makes the RECO/AOD sequence the same as what is run in the miniAOD sequence in 76X (i.e. integration of needed discriminators + bugfix) and removes the 're-running' of the taus in miniAOD. \n\nThe bugfix removes the 3prong1pi0 from the AOD sequence. This results in an increase of efficiency in the decaymodefinding. This was verified in the 76x ReminiAOD. \n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 12, "closed_at": "1454337347", "comments": 37, "commits": 8, "created_at": "1453747847", "deletions": 1699, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "5ba41ec0f20919770d307751f711b212c678890a", "merged_at": "1454337347", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 13060, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Integration of 76X Tau re-miniAOD into main 80X Sequence", "updated_at": "1458854527", "user": "isobelojalvo"}

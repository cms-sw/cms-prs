Both the full (`pfDeepBoostedJetTags`) and the mass-decorrelated (`pfMassDecorrelatedDeepBoostedJetTags`) taggers are updated. \r\n\r\nNeeds https://github.com/cms-data/RecoBTag-Combined/pull/21.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with a description of which tests have been performed to verify the correctness of the PR, including the eventual addition of new code for testing like unit tests, test configurations, additions or updates to the runTheMatrix test workflows -->\r\n\r\nThe update has been presented at the [BTV meeting](https://indico.cern.ch/event/808258/contributions/3366869/attachments/1817445/2971091/DeepAK8_BTV_Presentation_March25_PK.pdf). The new training shows improved performance on Phase1 detector compared to the 2016 training. The new training is also evaluated on 2016 samples and no loss of performance is found compared to the 2016 training. Therefore the updated model is intended for use in UL processing for all three years.\r\n\r\nSmall improvements have been made to the training afterwards to further reduce the mass sculpting. The performance of the latest version (in this PR) can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/lhhmjjnhayp29hm/deepAK8_PR_comp_20190329.pdf?dl=0). \r\n\r\nOutputs from CMSSW with this PR have been verified with the training framework.\r\n\r\n@gouskos @pkontaxa", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1554398295", "comments": 24, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1553860732", "deletions": 104, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "requires-external", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "e77b23871adef6c6bb263f26cbd59b93cf0b7d84", "merged_at": "1554398295", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 26298, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Update DeepAK8 to 94X training", "updated_at": "1554398295", "user": "hqucms"}

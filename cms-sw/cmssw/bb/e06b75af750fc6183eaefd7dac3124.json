This in turn entailed that if there was a movement exceeding the thresholds the DQM monitoring was crippled (all the other alignable parts were not plotted). I introduce a new boolean to decide whether to veto the upload, still not breaking the loop (so that all parts are plotted)\r\n   * a bug in `MillePedeDQMModule.cc` causing the thresholds on several parameters for `theta_Z` alignable to be taken instead from the `theta_Y`. \r\n\r\nTested with \r\n```bash\r\ncmsDriver.py pedeStep --data --conditions 101X_dataRun2_Express_v8 --scenario pp -s ALCAHARVEST:SiPixelAli --dasquery='file dataset=/StreamExpress/Run2018B-PromptCalibProdSiPixelAli-Express-v1/ALCAPROMPT run=318622' -n -1\r\n```\r\nThe situation before the fix:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5082376/41982380-95f65c82-7a2b-11e8-9879-da23e2502154.png)\r\n\r\nbecomes after the fixes:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5082376/41982202-190af49e-7a2b-11e8-819d-5a63416b34e3.png)\r\n\r\n***N.B.: no change in behavior for the actual payload creation is intended here, the changes shall affect only the monitoring***\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_10_1_X", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 9, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1530184266", "deletions": 9, "labels": ["alca-approved", "backport-ok", "bug-fix", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_1_X", "number": 23711, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[10.1.X] add a veto DB update boolean in the SiPixelAli harvesting to decide to block the payload creation", "updated_at": "1530513427", "user": "mmusich"}

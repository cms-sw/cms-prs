This PR fixes the problem and allows the script to run to completion and produce its output files.\r\n\r\nThe problem was that a `TTree` was created before its `TFile` was created. When the `TTree` reached 1 MB in memory, this exception was generated:\r\n```\r\n---- Begin Fatal Exception 28-Feb-2022 21:20:13 CET-----------------------\r\nAn exception of category 'FatalRootError' occurred while\r\n   [0] Processing  Event run: 1 lumi: 1 event: 17 stream: 0\r\n   [1] Running path 'p1'\r\n   [2] Calling method for module OscarMTProducer/'g4SimHits'\r\n   Additional Info:\r\n      [a] Fatal Root Error: @SUB=TBranch::WriteBasketImpl\r\nbasket's WriteBuffer failed.\r\n\r\n----- End Fatal Exception -------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\nThe fix is to create a temporary file for the `TTree` to use. This file can't be used for the actually writing, because the program has another file open that can clash with the temporary file. Thus, when the `TTree` is complete, the final output file is created and the temporary is removed.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe script runs successfully to completion and produces complete output files. Here are the commands to test the script:\r\n```\r\ncmsRun test/single_neutrino_cfg.py nEvents=1000\r\npython3 test/runP_Tracker.py geom=\"Extended2017Plan1\" label=Tracker \r\n```\r\n\r\nNo backport is needed.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 2, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1646088048", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "geometry-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 37095, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Fix AllStepsToTree option to runP_Trackery.py script", "updated_at": "1646088855", "user": "cvuosalo"}

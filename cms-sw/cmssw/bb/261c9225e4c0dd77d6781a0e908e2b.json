No issues were observed in the event generation otherwise.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1659614419", "comments": 6, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1659560570", "deletions": 27, "labels": ["simulation-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "7c1f17e0c17f7eca211c798333db4cc3a24eb299", "merged_at": "1659614418", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 38965, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Remove obsolete printInfo from G4muDarkBremsstrahlung", "updated_at": "1659614419", "user": "revering"}

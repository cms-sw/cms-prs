No issues were observed in the event generation otherwise.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 3, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1659560570", "deletions": 27, "labels": ["simulation-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 38965, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Remove obsolete printInfo from G4muDarkBremsstrahlung", "updated_at": "1659583149", "user": "revering"}

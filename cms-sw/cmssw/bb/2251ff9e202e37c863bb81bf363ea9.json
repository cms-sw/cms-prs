However, all events were associated to the default device, instead of the correct one, leading to a runtime error when multiple devices were used.\r\n\r\nThese changes associate to the correct CUDA device the events used to track if the conditions have been transferred.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nSee #34948 .\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nBackport of #34948 .", "branch": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1629716965", "comments": 20, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1629361348", "deletions": 12, "labels": ["fully-signed", "tests-approved", "bug-fix", "orp-approved", "backport-ok", "heterogeneous-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "557a7e8f2d9debe547ef3e7f19e44fe76654167b", "merged_at": "1629716965", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "number": 34949, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix uploading the EventSetup conditions to multiple CUDA devices [12.0.x]", "updated_at": "1629716966", "user": "fwyzard"}

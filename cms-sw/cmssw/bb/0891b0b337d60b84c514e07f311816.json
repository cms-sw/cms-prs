To work around this problem, cmsRun, at the beginning of the job, opened and closed a dummy conditions database that contained streamer information.  Now that we have moved to version 2 of the conditions database, this ROOT6 bug no longer affects us. Therefore, this pull request removes the workaround.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_2_ROOT6_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1404409703", "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1404409456", "deletions": 9, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "core-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "9fb8f3d2ea063c00e5b2c380c90f8db82065dcef", "merged_at": "1404409703", "merged_by": "davidlt", "number": 4515, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Remove obsolete workaround", "updated_at": "1404409949", "user": "wmtan"}

This means that e.g. the PR tests for jobs that would use threaded mode in production still use legacy mode in the tests. That is a problem, since legacy mode uses completely different code paths and therefore makes the tests unreliable.\r\n\r\nThis PR turns on threaded mod by default in the `DQM` step in `ConfigBuilder`. It should only affect small tests, not the production jobs which use threaded mode anyways.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nNone, this PR is to adjust the tests to what happens in the real world.\r\n\r\nThis will be included in #26232, this PR is mainly to isolate the effects in a separate test.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1553713585", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["code-checks-pending", "comparison-pending", "dqm-pending", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 26274, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Force-on threaded mode in DQMStore for the DQM step.", "updated_at": "1553713631", "user": "schneiml"}

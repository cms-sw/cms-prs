I think it was probably done because no const GeomDetType\\* was available then? But a year or two later the organization of the GeomDetType's seemed to settle down and it could have been fixed as I have done here. I've run the runthematrix Reco tests in case of some astonishing feedthrough effects but they all pass just fine :)\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1424510803", "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1424434330", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "c836c7527000ab3a9f8a7c0025bba546b446ad1c", "merged_at": "1424510803", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 7876, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "csc geom kill const cast", "updated_at": "1424510803", "user": "ptcox"}

Once again, this problem surfaced while using the new L1T menu in 14_2_0_pre1, but the scheduling problem has been there for a while but has gone unnoticed so far.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nIt was tested running an ad-hoc menu with only the HLT_TriMu_10_5_5_DZ_FromL1TkMuon path. Runs w/o errors.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1726745813", "deletions": 14, "labels": ["hlt-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "urgent", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_2_X", "number": 46054, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Fix ordering of modules in HLT_TriMu_10_5_5_DZ_FromL1TkMuon path.", "updated_at": "1726746068", "user": "rovere"}

These are based on UL pixel simulation but will **not** be used in the UL FastSim production which has already begun. \r\n\r\nThis PR is just meant to preserve the work that was done and to make the new resolution histograms easily accessible in the future with the hard-coded boolean `ULresolutionHistograms` which is set to `False`. As result, this PR should produce no change.\r\n\r\n[1] - https://github.com/cms-data/FastSimulation-TrackingRecHitProducer/pull/4\r\n\r\n#### Known issues/need for feedback\r\n\r\nThe new resolution histograms have been prepared for each year but the modifiers used to this point have been \"per-phase\". So in the case of Phase 1, the modifier needs to be different depending on the era. I currently have it coded as \r\n\r\n```python\r\n    from Configuration.Eras.Era_Run2_2017_FastSim_cff import Run2_2017_FastSim\r\n    Run2_2017_FastSim.toModify(fastTrackerRecHits, plugins = pixelPlugins2017UL)\r\n\r\n    from Configuration.Eras.Era_Run2_2018_FastSim_cff import Run2_2018_FastSim\r\n    Run2_2018_FastSim.toModify(fastTrackerRecHits, plugins = pixelPlugins2018UL)\r\n```\r\nbut this obviously does not work - it just conveys the intention. We could use feedback on the best way to accomplish this implementation.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe following have been run successfully:\r\n```\r\nscram build code-checks\r\nscram build code-format\r\nscram b runtests\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also ran `runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos` but see failures that appear to be unrelated to these changes.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 7, "comments": 30, "commits": 15, "created_at": "1628250122", "deletions": 318, "labels": ["fastsim-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "requires-external", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 34812, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[RFC] Add updated but \"off\" FastSim pixel resolution histograms infrastructure", "updated_at": "1645631040", "user": "lcorcodilos"}

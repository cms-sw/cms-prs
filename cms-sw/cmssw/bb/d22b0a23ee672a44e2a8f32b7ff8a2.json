I have added some command-line options to it using `argparse` (see `--help` for more info). Some examples below.\r\n   ```bash\r\n   hltPrintMenuVersions /dev/CMSSW_13_2_0/Fake2 -c 'cms_hlt_v3_r/convertMe!@cmsr'\r\n   hltPrintMenuVersions /dev/CMSSW_13_2_0/Fake2 --db run3                        \r\n   hltPrintMenuVersions /dev/CMSSW_10_0_0/Fake2 --db run2\r\n   hltPrintMenuVersions /cdaq/special/PilotBeamTest2021/Circulating --db adg                        \r\n   ```\r\n\r\n - Upon the release of a new HLT menu for data-taking (or MC production), TSG produces a spreadsheet which contains information on the content of the menu. The tools used to create this spreadsheet are added in this PR to `HLTrigger/Configuration/scripts/utils` (see the readme file in `scripts/utils` for further details).\r\n\r\nUnit tests for `hltPrintMenuVersions` and `hltMenuContentToCSVs` are included. (These new tests rely on connecting to ConfDB, so I fear they might occasionally fail due to connection glitches, based on what I remember from https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/37598#issuecomment-1326628334.)\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nManual tests (and the new unit tests pass).\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported, please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nA backport is not necessary, but this PR could be backported down to the release cycle used for HLT-menu development (i.e. `13_2_X`) if it is useful.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 10, "closed_at": "1696864056", "comments": 7, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1696699540", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["hlt-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "b87cab864c2bc76a4d93b4dfffe80a4a2fd57b87", "merged_at": "1696864056", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_13_3_X", "number": 42967, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "add `hltPrintMenuVersions` and utilities for HLT-menu spreadsheets", "updated_at": "1696864056", "user": "missirol"}

The derived class can alter the clusters before they are inserted into the event.  Implement here one such class for MC studies.  It sets the cluster's isMerged() state according to whether it is associated with more than one (in-time) SimTrack.\nProduction is unaffected.  The new plugin can be added to the workflow via the customization config provided here.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 8, "closed_at": "1425571292", "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1425501123", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 8082, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Plugin that tags merged clusters per MC truth", "updated_at": "1425571292", "user": "wmtford"}

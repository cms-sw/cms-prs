There have been a number of changes in DD4hep-related code in both CMSSW and DD4hep since then, and the problem seems to have disappeared. Unfortunately, we don't know the specific change that fixed the problem, but there are a number of likely candidates.\r\n\r\nThe workflow has been run a total of over 30 times in CMSSW_12_0_X_2021-06-03-1100 and CMSSW_12_0_X_2021-06-06-2300 with entirely consistent results each time. It appears the workflow is now stable in the latest IBs.

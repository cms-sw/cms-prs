One was made const but the second had to be set at run time. Therefore EgHLTOfflineSource had to be switched to a thread_unsafe::DQMEDAnalyzer. \n\nMy suggestion is the second static, egHLT::TrigCodes::trigBitSetMap_, should become attached to a member variable of EgHLTOfflineSource and then passed as an argument to the various helper classes.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1422347265", "comments": 7, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1422202062", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "18bd76fbbe8a5939d4f613502229496a97ed6b9d", "merged_at": "1422347265", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 7360, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fixed thread problems in DQMOffline/Trigger", "updated_at": "1425482822", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

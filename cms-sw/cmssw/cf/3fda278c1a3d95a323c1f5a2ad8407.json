We've just finished a large migration where all code calling both consumesMany and getManyByType was replaced by GetterOfProducts or was removed in some other way. The function consumesMany has been deleted entirely from the Framework. The only uses of getManyByType that are left are the ones where consumeMany was not called. All these have been broken since 2015. The Framework will throw an exception if these calls to getManyByType are executed. This change moves the exception throw from the Framework directly to the module at the location of the getManyByType call.\r\n\r\nThere are two alternatives I can think of:\r\n\r\n1. These modules have been broken since 2015. I could delete the files completely instead.\r\n\r\n2. If we really need these modules, we could upgrade them to use GetterOfProducts. This seems unlikely, because they have been broken for so many years already (I don't want to create new tests, but if provided an otherwise working test I'll run it).\r\n\r\nIf you want me to implement one of the alternatives, ask and I will do that instead.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nNothing uses this code and it is already broken. There is nothing to test.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1689345852", "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1689278641", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["alca-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved", "trk"], "merge_commit_sha": "1b4b722db2f83b4d11c468022e61dd30254eb6a4", "merged_at": "1689345852", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_13_2_X", "number": 42261, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Replace calls to getManyByType with exception", "updated_at": "1689345852", "user": "wddgit"}

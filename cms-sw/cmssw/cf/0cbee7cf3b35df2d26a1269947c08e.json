The checksums in the framework were fixed in a previous pull request that is already merged.\nQuite a few packages needed to have their classes_def.xml files resynched with the 7_4_X (ROOT5) branch before the changes for ROOT6 were applied.  The two most blatant examples are DataFormats/L1Trigger.and DataFormats/TrackReco.\nPlease merge this request as soon as convenient.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_ROOT6_X", "changed_files": 47, "closed_at": "1418884456", "comments": 1, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1418853863", "deletions": 227, "labels": ["alca-pending", "analysis-pending", "comparison-pending", "core-pending", "daq-pending", "db-pending", "fastsim-pending", "generators-pending", "l1-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "ac520c388a484aea868d49fff210ecd957431294", "merged_at": "1418884456", "merged_by": "davidlt", "number": 6964, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Re-enable edmCheckClassVersion for ROOT6", "updated_at": "1418906625", "user": "wmtan"}

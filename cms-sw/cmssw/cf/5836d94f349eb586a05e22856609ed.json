This would allow us to specify, via a menu, whether we want to save pixel data at per-module or per-ROC granularity.\r\n\r\nThis feature is particularly important for special fills where we have high-rate zero-bias streams for AlcaLumi. The proposed change could reduce event size by a factor of ~7 under these conditions compared to the current implementation. It is essential to have this feature for successful pp-Ref and HI vdM fills planned in the next weeks.\r\n\r\nHowever, per-ROC information is critical for physics, as it helps us understand instabilities and non-linearities within individual modules, and we wish to continue recording this data.

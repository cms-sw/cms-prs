This was accidently\nbroken in 2012, although as far as I know no one\nnormally uses this option with this source. It was\nnoticed when someone used the option to debug a\nrelated problem in another source. Added a unit test\nso we will notice if this problem recurs.\n\nThe bug caused the input file to be prematurely closed\nwhen the fake input file transitions were occurring.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_2_X", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": "1416327784", "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1415830342", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "14ef038c6298e0e6dbecb54553398ae850b581cb", "merged_at": "1416327784", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_2_X", "number": 6364, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Bug fix for NewEventStreamFileReader", "updated_at": "1423062863", "user": "wddgit"}

Is a backport of  #25984 as was requested. Nothing is different in terms of code ( with the small exception that ConversionTools interface is different in 10_2X than 10_5X, so i adjusted it). The rate has been measured and is 5.35% as in the  #25984. Thanks\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nGeorge", "branch": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "changed_files": 5, "comments": 0, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1550756377", "deletions": 0, "labels": [], "number": 25995, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Skim backport in102 x", "updated_at": "1550756377", "user": "gkaratha"}

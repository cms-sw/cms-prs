Due to the inherently non-local nature of the algorithm, we implemented custom masked warp intrinsics currently not available in the Alpaka library. Additionally, we utilized the extended ECL-CC (connected component detection) graph algorithm to support this use case. This extension involves reorganizing SoA data objects into a CSR (Compressed Sparse Row) format during both pre-processing and post-processing stages to enable efficient graph traversal.\r\n\r\nResolves https://github.com/cms-sw/framework-team/issues/1139\r\n\r\nPR validation:\r\n\r\nThe implementation expects input data to be provided in device-resident SoA format.

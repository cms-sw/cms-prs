Expecting differences in all validation plots using the TrackingParticles via TrackingVertex, e.g.\n- in primary vertex validation anything vs. TrackingVertex sum(pT^2)\n- in V0 validation, K0/Lambda fake rate\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1447478661", "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1447315050", "deletions": 10, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "bf7bc0e94523bb0da6e4c41523ac06f9289ce33e", "merged_at": "1447478661", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 12391, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Another fix to TrackingVertex->TrackingParticle links in premixing", "updated_at": "1476956900", "user": "makortel"}

This makes the changes from #35380 effective to PPS direct simulation and other PPS applications: in particularly moving the pixel sensors closer to the beam by ~750 um in Run3 scenarios.\r\n  * Geometry configs for 2022 created - to avoid confusion, content as for 2021.\r\n  * Direct simulation Run3 scenarios updated: alignment changed to compensate the move of pixel sensors mentioned in the first bullet.\r\n\r\nFor Run2, no changes in results are expected.\r\n\r\nNo backport is foreseen.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nBelow a summary plot from Run3 scenarios of the direct simulation. Blue = before this PR. Green = with this PR, but only after \"activation\" of the changes from #35380. Red dashed = at the end of this PR, i.e. including the compensation shift. Especially the x histograms show the shifts of the RP acceptance closer to and further from the LHC beam (x = 0). The compensation shift (blue - red comparison) is not perfect, but good enough (the RP approach to the beam is just a forecast anyway).\r\n[dirsim_cmp_Run3.pdf](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/files/7235374/dirsim_cmp_Run3.pdf)\r\n\r\nFor Run2, the plots below compare the results before this PR (blue, covered with green) and after this PR (red dashed)\r\n  * [dirsim_cmp_Run2.pdf](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/files/7235421/dirsim_cmp_Run2.pdf) - no change as expected\r\n  * [reco_cmp.pdf](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/files/7235422/reco_cmp.pdf) - no changes as expected\r\n\r\n@fabferro @diemort @grzanka FYI\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "comments": 8, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1632730849", "deletions": 152, "labels": ["dqm-approved", "geometry-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "number": 35424, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "PPS: Run3 alignment fix for direct simulation", "updated_at": "1632836019", "user": "jan-kaspar"}

Handling of daughter particles doesn't take into account the smuon pdgID, leading to duplicated muon SimTracks.\r\n2. A cut in the z coordinate of the decay point supresses smuon SimTracks for high lifetime signals.\r\n\r\nMore details about the issue can be found in slide 13 of [1].\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe changes have been validated using privately produced signal samples of pair production of long-lived smuons decaying to a muon and a gravitino (smuon->mu+G).

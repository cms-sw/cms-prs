The new binning is by BX rather than by groups of BXs, similar to the Timing vs BX finely binned plot used in Offline DQM. This leads to the new plot to be quite busy with many bins, but the expectation is that DAQ experts will zoom in on the x-axis using the Customize button on the DQM GUI to study their region of interest.\r\n\r\nSlight modifications were made to the TrigPrimTask module so the way the BX binning is done more closely matches what is done in the TimingTask module, which also contain some vs BX plots. Some plot descriptions were also updated to mention relevant information for these plots, such as the BX ids starting at 1, as well as a minor relabelling of the x-axis. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nAn Online DQM-like workflow was run and the plots were uploaded to a private DQM GUI. We verified with ECAL DAQ that the new binning was to their liking. We also verified that the new BX binning changes did not affect any other plot binned by BX.\r\n\r\n#### Backport:\r\n\r\nA backport of this PR to CMSSW_11_2_X has been submitted here: https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/33275", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1617228897", "comments": 8, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1616614115", "deletions": 34, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "611abe7126d21e4d74d1673252ae0dc9e52c9a06", "merged_at": "1617228897", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 33264, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Change binning of TP occupancy vs BX plot and update BX plot descriptions", "updated_at": "1617228897", "user": "alejands"}

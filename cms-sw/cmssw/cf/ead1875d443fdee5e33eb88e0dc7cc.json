No other validation was performed, as this is a minor change only affecting DQM.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1673100203", "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1671436891", "deletions": 88, "labels": ["dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "de1f6b10c72cae263b41e155cf965c480cd1134a", "merged_at": "1673100203", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "number": 40359, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "B2G HLT DQM update", "updated_at": "1673100203", "user": "finnlabe"}

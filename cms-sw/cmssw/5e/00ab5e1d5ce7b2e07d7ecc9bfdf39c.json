These types of samples are currently used by the JetMET group for jet energy calibrations, but currently we are using a sub-optimal configuration; the new method works much better. It is not foreseen that this PR will have any effect on other packages. This should simply add a new feature to the CMSSW-Pythia8 interface.\r\n\r\nWe would like to include this feature in CMSSW in time for the upcoming 2017 MC production campaign using CMSSW_9_3_0.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1500529183", "comments": 39, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1499711222", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "generators-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "df9625ca1ce760009a11c67ec19d2d35d68dfaff", "merged_at": "1500529183", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_3_X", "number": 19668, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "Update pythia8 pt hat reweight user hook", "updated_at": "1502792304", "user": "aperloff"}

On thing that makes the migration complicated is this factory pattern with functions inheriting from the `EcalClusterFunctionBaseClass`.\r\n\r\nBut before thinking of a solution for these ECAL cluster functions, maybe this this is a good opportunity to think about where this factory pattern is really needed to reduce the complexity of the migration a bit.\r\n\r\nI spotted the `EcalBasicClusterLocalContCorrection`, which is only used once in the `EgammaSCCorrectionMaker`. It was and is never swapped with alternative corrector functions, so the factory pattern doesn't seem really necessary.\r\n\r\nHence, this PR suggests to turn `EcalBasicClusterLocalContCorrection` into a usual helper class that is migrated to the ESGetTokens.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCMSSW compiles, local matrix tests pass.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nNo backport intended.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 8, "closed_at": "1610036008", "comments": 13, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1609151710", "deletions": 96, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "46c2452ce2f901597b4d385e6423dda8009d1062", "merged_at": "1610036008", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 32588, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Migrate EcalBasicClusterLocalContCorrection to ESTokens", "updated_at": "1610036008", "user": "guitargeek"}

One with the measured position by the positioning sensors\n2. Same as (1) plus an upward shift within the sys uncertainty\n3. Same as (2) but with downward shift.\n\nThe files are in separate folders. Hope this is OK but simple renaming could not be done because of the namespace \"castor:\" used by DDL.\n\nFSQ Group wants to request simulations with these files.\nThank you.\nAutomatically ported from CMSSW_7_6_X #11730 (original by @cbaus).\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1447690313", "comments": 40, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1445235293", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "orp-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 11928, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add castor geometry files with position for 2015", "updated_at": "1453216622", "user": "cmsbuild"}

(The particle filter is used to select the generated particles that are in the acceptance of the detector)\r\nThus, it will be possible to use the same facility for the upgrade studies. At the moment, the FSimEvent, which uses this KineParticleFilter, is used in [the HGCAL ntuplizer](https://github.com/CMS-HGCAL/reco-ntuples).\r\n\r\nI performed a validation using the 250402.0 workflow from runTheMatrix (ttbar events with premixing). To do so, I checked the generalTracks. Indeed, in the FastSim the tracks are derived from the MC tracks, therefore if a different set of generated particles selected, it should reflect in the collection of tracks. \r\n\r\nI find that the number of tracks and their pT spectrum are strictly identical in the two cases.\r\n![canvas_1_new](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4553043/45094575-0243d280-b11c-11e8-996b-49f2f478d7c7.png)\r\n![canvas_1_default](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4553043/45094605-12f44880-b11c-11e8-900e-4a8d2e1bedaf.png)\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1536834816", "comments": 13, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1536147688", "deletions": 13, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fastsim-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "caab4a43d8a92b448407ec27dec748191344643e", "merged_at": "1536834816", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_3_X", "number": 24473, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "FastSim: make two parameters of the KineParticleFilter configurable", "updated_at": "1536834816", "user": "beaudett"}

One of the plugins performs a tag and probe (T&P) method to monitor scouting muon and vertex distributions and efficiencies. The second plugin is designed to monitor distributions and efficiencies of muon L1 seeds. We add the following to the HLTriggerOffline/Scouting directory:\r\n\r\n1. plugins/ directory, where we have the core of the implementation of T&P and L1 seeds in the C++ files. We monitor distributions of scouting muons and vertices from the hltScoutingMuonPackerVtx and the hltScoutingMuonPackerNoVtx collections (scouting muon collections) and for scouting muon L1 seeds. Header files (.h) are used to declare classes used in the plugin. \r\n2. python/ directory, where we have the configuration files. We have one configuration file for T&P and one for L1 seeds. In the T&P config file we read the scouting muon and scouting vertex collections. In the L1 seeds config file we specify which triggers to monitor, and read them. Additionally, we add a Client config file that contains a DQMEDHarvester that plots efficiencies given numerator and denominator histograms for both T&P and L1 seeds.\r\n3. test/ directory, where we have the test file. This file is used to read events from root files, and run the code. The sequence of events is defined in this file. First the EDAnalyzer for T&P and L1 seeds must run, and then the DQMEDHarvester runs to measure the efficiencies. \r\n\r\nThis plugin is to be merged with Egamma and JetMet to have a full DQM Offline framework for scouting. The development of this code was presented in several meetings:\r\n     - https://indico.cern.ch/event/1476209/\r\n     - https://indico.cern.ch/event/1492373/\r\nThis PR doesnt include the common sequences for the scouting DQM workflow. They will be integrated in a future PR. \r\nThe implementation was built on top of CMSSW_7.\r\n**PR validation:**\r\nWe have checked out all dependencies and have a clean build. Code-checks were applied. Most runTheMatrix tests were successfully run as well:\r\n[runall-report-step123-.log](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18595230/runall-report-step123-.log)\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 30, "comments": 5, "commits": 11, "created_at": "1738189400", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "new-package-pending", "code-checks-rejected"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_0_X", "number": 47207, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Scouting Offline DQM framework for muons", "updated_at": "1738347934", "user": "JavierGarciadeCastro"}

This PR fixes few bugs that have been introduced in the\npast (commit\nhttps://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/commit/197ddb37826148fe40a09a22f05146180266d2d0,\nPR https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/3411). All the include files\nthat are CMSSW related should never be added directly in DQMStore.cc,\nbut to Standalone.h protected by the WITHOUT_CMS_FRAMEWORK condition. A\nrequired edm::service namespace was missing, and this bug allowed the\noriginal compilation of the code that would have otherwise correctly\nfailed to compile. This indicates that a better way of testing the\nstandalong compilation should be found, but that's not extremely urgent.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1452954053", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1452714721", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "bcbe8043ddf40dfae65fe4e08219d3feb65b920b", "merged_at": "1452954053", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 12934, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix DQM standalone compilation", "updated_at": "1452954054", "user": "rovere"}

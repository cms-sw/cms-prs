Unlike the two issues above, this is probably harmless, but it is unnecessary.  In fact, none of the declared classes are template instances.\n\nThis is a purely technical fix, and should bypass the L2 signature if not signed in a reasonable time.\nOf course, it should still have the usual testing.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1425037658", "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1424892874", "deletions": 23, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "4cf802b8926b24bf3bdb93b04a539949d74fe7d6", "merged_at": "1425037658", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 7952, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix classes.h file", "updated_at": "1425054414", "user": "wmtan"}

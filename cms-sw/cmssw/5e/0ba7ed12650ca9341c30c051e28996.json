The configuration looks like this:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/19be691a-dc9d-4fbe-b315-d0c50f19aacc)\r\n\r\nThe implementation utilizes already available `procModifier`s, and can be run with the `procModifier` sequence `alpaka,singleIterPatatrack,trackingLST,seedingLST`. Workflow 0.757 is being introduced to monitor this configuration.\r\n\r\nAs part of the validation, the `procModifier`s mentioned above have been tested separately and in their \"allowed\" combinations, and seem to be giving expected results. In any case, it would be good to test the following, previously introduced workflows:\r\n- 0.75\r\n- 0.751\r\n- 0.753\r\n- 0.754\r\n- 0.755\r\n\r\nSlides on this were presented at the [HLT Upgrade meeting of April 22nd](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1540225/#5-single-patatrack-iteration-w).\r\n\r\nFYI @slava77 ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 7, "comments": 17, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1744824526", "deletions": 19, "labels": ["hlt-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "tests-started", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 47891, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "open", "title": "Introduce a single LST-seeded, CKF-building iteration based on Patatrack pixel tracks for Phase 2 HLT", "updated_at": "1745492440", "user": "VourMa"}

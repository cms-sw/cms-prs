The configuration looks like this:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/19be691a-dc9d-4fbe-b315-d0c50f19aacc)\r\n\r\nThe implementation utilizes already available `procModifier`s, and can be run with the `procModifier` sequence `alpaka,singleIterPatatrack,trackingLST,seedingLST`. Workflow 0.756 is being introduced to monitor this configuration.\r\n\r\nAs part of the validation, the `procModifier`s mentioned above have been tested separately and in their \"allowed\" combinations, and seem to be giving expected results. In any case, it would be good to test the following, previously introduced workflows:\r\n- 0.75\r\n- 0.751\r\n- 0.753\r\n- 0.754\r\n- 0.755\r\n\r\nA presentation at an HLT Upgrade meeting and at a TRK POG meeting will be arranged to discuss more details.\r\n\r\nFYI @slava77 ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 7, "comments": 5, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1744824526", "deletions": 19, "labels": ["hlt-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "tests-started", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 47891, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Introduce a single LST-seeded, CKF-building iteration based on Patatrack pixel tracks for Phase 2 HLT", "updated_at": "1744825641", "user": "VourMa"}

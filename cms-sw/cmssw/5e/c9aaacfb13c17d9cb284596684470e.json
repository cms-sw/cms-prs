The default implementation is the absolute value. Hence, I named the new variable collections as signed parameters. The output of this HLT producer will now have three more variable collections. The corresponding change to computation time is expected to be negligible, as there is no additional computation required for these variables.\r\n\r\nMore details can be found in the following [Scouting Meeting Presentation](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1366361/#8-scouting-2024-egamma-updates).\r\n\r\nPR validation:\r\n * Standard set of code checks and code-formatting done.\r\n * Suggested test in [CMSSW PR instructions](https://cms-sw.github.io/PRWorkflow.html) passed successfully.\r\n * An HLT configuration was re-run on 100 events on a single thread and the output was manually verified. As expected the new collections had different signs (+ or -) compared to the previous collections. However, the absolute value was identical. The test configuration and output files are on AFS at /afs/cern.ch/work/a/asahasra/public/ScoutingStudy/For2024ScoutingEGUpdate/CMSSW_14_0_0_pre2/src/TestSignedOutput_scoutingPFMC.py and /afs/cern.ch/work/a/asahasra/public/ScoutingStudy/For2024ScoutingEGUpdate/CMSSW_14_0_0_pre2/src/TestSignedOutput_outputScoutingPF.root respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 8, "comments": 8, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1706014500", "deletions": 33, "labels": ["hlt-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "number": 43774, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "open", "title": "Added signed GSF track variable collections to the HLT producer: 14_0", "updated_at": "1706018213", "user": "Sam-Harper"}

That way we can have tau discriminators available, and better offline tau reference object selection.\r\n\r\nThe DQM plots contain now two sets, one with default medium working point tau against jet selection, and another with decayModeFinding only. The latter plots are named with string 'LowPurity'.\r\n\r\nAs the offline tau selection changes, expecting differences between new and old plots, however, old plots and new low purity plots should be identical.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "comments": 21, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1722940693", "deletions": 69, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-rejected", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 45648, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 4, "state": "open", "title": "HLTTauDQM: support for PatTau ref objects", "updated_at": "1741204877", "user": "slehti"}

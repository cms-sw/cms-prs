This means that, if a file cannot be opened for any reason, our TFileAdaptor throws an exception, which JIT makes into a call to terminate(). This fix uses a thread local static std::exception_ptr to\nstore the exception instead of immediately throwing it. Then the caller of TFile::Open can check if there was an exception and rethrow it.\nAttempts to open a TFile outside of cmsRun jobs do not have this problem, because they use the standard ROOT adaptor, which does not throw.\nThis request has been tested with the short relval matrix. There were no errors.\nPlease merge this in a timely manner.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_ROOT6_X", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1391837987", "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1391820394", "deletions": 10, "labels": ["core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "26c777825919cfc7df046dca1f2f82d686006661", "merged_at": "1391837987", "merged_by": "davidlt", "number": 2372, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Propagate exceptions from TFile opening", "updated_at": "1392221666", "user": "wmtan"}

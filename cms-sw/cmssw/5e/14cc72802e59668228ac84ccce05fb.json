If the outer state is not defined, now it will use the position and momentum at the closest approach for propagation to calorimeters.\r\n\r\nResults shown in this talk [1] is a good proof that this propagator fix does a reasonable job for patatrack pixel tracks in PF.\r\n\r\nThis PR should have no effect on PF based on full tracking (i.e. any matrix tests in jenkins).\r\n\r\n[1] https://indico.cern.ch/event/894094/contributions/3797556/\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nResults presented in [1] may serve as validation.\r\nAlso, I made sure the that 11634.0 (TTbar_14TeV+TTbar_14TeV_TuneCP5_2021_....) runs fine.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\nThis is not a backport.\r\n\r\n@bendavid @jsalfeld \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1585298847", "comments": 11, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1585181155", "deletions": 9, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "ca100799d82b9f27240a571d376f571dadba7df0", "merged_at": "1585298847", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 29307, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "PF track propagator fix for pixel tracks", "updated_at": "1585298847", "user": "hatakeyamak"}

At the same time I updated sample config files, and reorganized the debugging output of CSCGasCollisions (ready for studies of those simhits which do not lead to CSC digis - mainly low energy electrons that do not cross a CSC gas layer.) As part of this updating I also had to remove cout in the CSC Digis themselves - that pull request has already been accepted in 75X. I have thoroughly tested these updates in 732 but I have not been successful in running in a 75X IB - assert failure in calorimeter digitization, which of course has nothing to do with this pull request.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 13, "closed_at": "1425583512", "comments": 10, "commits": 9, "created_at": "1425552094", "deletions": 289, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "fully-signed", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "f08aa7626306a239955435431e84c0ecd879305b", "merged_at": "1425583512", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 8088, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "CSCDigitizer cout to MessageLogger and updates", "updated_at": "1425583512", "user": "ptcox"}

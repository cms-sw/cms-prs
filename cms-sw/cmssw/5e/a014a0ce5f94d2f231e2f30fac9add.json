Previously, the const\nmethod 'correct' was using a member data for a temporary buffer\nwhich was being changes on each call to 'correct'. To make the\nroutine thread safe we now use a buffer on the stack if only a small\nbuffer is needed and use a std::vector if a larger buffer is needed.\n\nThis problem was caught by the static analyzer.\nAutomatically ported from CMSSW_7_4_X #7682\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1424249029", "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1424172234", "deletions": 10, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "6d4eaeec1125c9de574c0a9dc3e3689e3b2f9550", "merged_at": "1424249029", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 7784, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Made FFTJetCorrector thread safe", "updated_at": "1428429706", "user": "cmsbuild"}

I've done it only for the ones I am most familiar with. Also the changes fall in the AlCa area, but it would be wise to assign dqm category as reviewers as well.\r\n\r\nThe changes have been tested via `runTheMatrix.py -l 1001.0` and the output harvested files have been uploaded to a local development GUI.\r\nI am attaching here the results of the test:\r\n\r\n   * `SiStripGainsAAG`:\r\n\r\n![screenshot 2017-06-20 18 36 57](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5082376/27344926-567db09a-55e8-11e7-895b-c27f6ca3990c.png)\r\n\r\n   * `SiStripGains`: \r\n\r\n![screenshot 2017-06-20 18 37 20](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5082376/27344932-597f7c6a-55e8-11e7-8928-a0ffc4be3211.png)\r\n\r\n   * `SiPixelAli`:\r\n\r\n![screenshot 2017-06-20 18 37 40](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5082376/27344938-5cccf0f0-55e8-11e7-861d-c9c0500ada10.png)\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1498298405", "comments": 12, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1497969938", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["alca-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "52907a4c023e2d9cd105a7a2eaf82074acaa889f", "merged_at": "1498298405", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_2_X", "number": 19385, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "[92X] Adding the DQMEventInfo module in SiStripGains and SiPixelAli PCL sequences", "updated_at": "1498803896", "user": "mmusich"}

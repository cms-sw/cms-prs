Otherwise, we get a warning. We had the same situation with [FWCore/SOA](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/CommonTools/Utils/BuildFile.xml#L5) (see https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/31459#issuecomment-692737732). I just noticed it because even thought missing this flag results in only a warning with scram, it causes my [experimental CMSSW Arch linux package](https://github.com/guitargeek/PKGBUILDs/tree/master/cmssw) to not compile.\r\n\r\nThis PR further fixes a typo I made in the previous PR https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/33019.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCMSSW compiles.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nNo backport intended.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 15, "closed_at": "1615903711", "comments": 31, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1615408092", "deletions": 16, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "generators-approved", "geometry-approved", "hlt-approved", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "4ea81695513b7a0925dd762d8b4669369f12ece9", "merged_at": "1615903711", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 33143, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "Clean BuildFiles, fix typo and add source_only flags to fix warnings", "updated_at": "1615903711", "user": "guitargeek"}

The new modifier is not used in the `run3` era though and so the default ratio timing algorithm is used in Run 3 reconstruction.\r\n\r\nThe change can run out of the box with the current prompt and express GTs but for better handling a new prompt tag with the calibrations and a new express tag with the offsets for ratio timing will be prepared to replace the HLT tags in the GTs.\r\n\r\n[1] https://indico.cern.ch/event/1424192/contributions/5990405/attachments/2872238/5028943/ecal_cctiming_ppd_20240606.pdf\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nNo syntax errors in python configuration.

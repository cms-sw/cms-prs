This PR changes all put calls in alignment and calibration to use std::unique_ptr instead of std::auto_ptr. Some other instances of std::auto_ptr in alignment and calibration may also have been changed to std::unique_ptr. Also, at the request of @ghellwig, make_unique was used throughout, and some raw pointers that could cause problems were changed to unique_ptr.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 67, "closed_at": "1463549609", "comments": 18, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1462307651", "deletions": 555, "labels": ["alca-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "39355f84423b3731b78dd359d6e263f0fee860ad", "merged_at": "1463549609", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 14361, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 9, "state": "closed", "title": "Use unique_ptr, not auto_ptr, in Alignment/Calibration", "updated_at": "1464229942", "user": "wmtan"}

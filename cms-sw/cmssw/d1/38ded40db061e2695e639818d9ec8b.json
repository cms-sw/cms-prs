This should not affect 8_1 production.\r\n\r\nEMY is a configuration of Geant4 electromagnetic physics (so, called EM option3)recommended for more accurate simulation at relatively low energy (HEP detector studies, medical, space science). This configuration force >2 steps of a charged particle inside any volume, and more strong step limit near any geometry boundary. This may be useful for more accurate simulation of MIP particles in Si sensors. We can expect factor 2 slowdown of simulation for HGCall test-beam. This Physics List already used by CALICE developer to understand test-beam results of sampling calorimeter with a small sampling fraction, other EM configurations were not sufficiently accurate.", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1479927556", "comments": 22, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1479225408", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "5c9267912204b87eedc3bbb4ce785c1182ee2b19", "merged_at": "1479927556", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 16585, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Added PhysList for study of HGCAL TB", "updated_at": "1479927556", "user": "civanch"}

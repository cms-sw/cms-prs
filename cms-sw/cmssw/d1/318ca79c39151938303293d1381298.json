This should bring some memory usage improvements in multicore jobs.\n\nTrial of converting a package that used TMVA::Reader to GBRForest + use edm::GlobalCache.\nUnderlying regression weights were gradient boosted, despite method name (read from xml).\n\nAt most, some jitter may be expected, otherwise expect no physics impact.\nAlso expect some reduction in RSS.\n\n@bendavid \n\n@Dr15Jones You might be interested in this too if you want to look for thread safety issues. FYI GBRForest is threadsafe.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 11, "closed_at": "1437804784", "comments": 71, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1436593487", "deletions": 245, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "bb1385aa1707bee715c9d7dd2a8342747b4343bb", "merged_at": "1437804784", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 10143, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 9, "state": "closed", "title": "Try converting RecoParticleFlow/PFTracking to GBRForest + GlobalCache", "updated_at": "1437804784", "user": "lgray"}

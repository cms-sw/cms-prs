This PR allows to store TOTEM's T2 digis as the latter, to make it compatible with the rechits storage. As no dataset has been produced with the earlier data format, no conversion rule is required.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles, and runs.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

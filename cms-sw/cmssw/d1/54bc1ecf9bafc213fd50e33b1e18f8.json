This goes together with PR cms-data/L1Trigger-CSCTriggerPrimitives#6. Follow-up of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/33570\r\n* Quality assignment functions were moved to `LCTQualityAssignment`\r\n* GEMCSC LUT producer was updated to reflect cms-data/L1Trigger-CSCTriggerPrimitives#6\r\n* LUT functions for physical ALCT-CLCT crossings were moved to `CSCALCTCrossCLCT`\r\n* New procedures for Run-3 GEM-CSC trigger were added\r\n\r\n**In the next PR** we will be updating the GEM-CSC matching procedures with 1/2-strip resolution and 1/8-strip resolution. The former is intended to be compatible with Run-2 EMTF. The latter would be compatible with Run-3 EMTF. The CSCUpgradeMotherboardLUT will be deleted (all luts in cms-data). CSCGEMMotherboardME11 and CSCGEMMotherboardME21 will be merged into CSCGEMMotherboard. CSCMotherboardME11 will be merged into CSCUpgradeMotherboard. This will be possible since we don't split up the LCT finding in ME1/a and ME1/b. Sorting and readout functions will be streamlined as well.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested with WF 11634.0.

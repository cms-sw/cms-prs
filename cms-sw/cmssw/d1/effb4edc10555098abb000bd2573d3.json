I have the impression that it should have been initialized to `true` within every iteration of that loop. Coul the responsibles of the code (@cms-sw/dqm-l2 should know how to contact them) have a look at it?\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nIt compiles\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 17, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1630132405", "deletions": 13, "labels": ["dqm-approved", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "hold", "code-checks-approved", "trk-dpg-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "number": 35058, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Remove an unneeded assignment for passcuts_hit in SiPixelPhase1TrackEfficiency", "updated_at": "1630991078", "user": "perrotta"}

The new implementation allows to use the same tag for more record+labels in a GT, which was producing an error previously.\nThis is fully back-ward compatible ( while a new GT with more then one entry with the same tag will be readable only by this code )\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1463726295", "comments": 12, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1463322584", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["comparison-available", "db-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-rejected"], "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 14508, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix for GTEntry_t hash function", "updated_at": "1463726295", "user": "ggovi"}

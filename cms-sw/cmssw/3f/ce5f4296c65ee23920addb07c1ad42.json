This is in the first place in preparation for a backport to 80X, where this issue occurs. By default and for CMSSW>=8_1_X the parameter will be false. \r\n * adding a producer plugin (PATTauIDEmbedder) that allows to write a slimmedTau collection back into the EDM event content with updated MVAIsolation and MVA electron identification. \r\n\r\nAll these changes are \"high level\" with effect only on the analysis level on already existing miniAOD. They are meant for the currently ongoing analyses with the actual target to be backported down to CMSSW_8_0_X. \r\n\r\nNeither unit/matrixTests nor DQM plots tracking physics performance should be affected by these changes. \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nRoger\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "changed_files": 15, "closed_at": "1491212199", "comments": 15, "commits": 9, "created_at": "1487949932", "deletions": 89, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-rejected", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "number": 17624, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 10, "state": "closed", "title": "Developments to provide facilitated access to new TauID information (all high level changes)", "updated_at": "1510909325", "user": "roger-wolf"}

Also added relevant include headers in a number of places to get the serialisation up and running. Please include asap into the 7.1.boostio branch so we can see what else is missing. \n\nThanks,\n    cheers, andreas\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_BOOSTIO_X", "changed_files": 111, "closed_at": "1390380703", "comments": 7, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1390380658", "deletions": 102, "labels": [], "merge_commit_sha": "ab99b2690f7a6140c6d148b6fbc1ee8c0c8a0e99", "merged_at": "1390380703", "merged_by": "davidlt", "number": 2124, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "cleared out wrongly merged stuff from 7.0.x/7.1.x and fixed several serialisation issues", "updated_at": "1390396132", "user": "apfeiffer1"}

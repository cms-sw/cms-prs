Even though this PR does not include a better validation plugin (for example, to provide monitoring with respect to GEN objects), I think it would already be good to start with this cleanup. A future (generic) validation plugin for HLT-Top can go under `HLTriggerOffline/Common/`, and I think there would be no need to keep a separate package (like the current `HLTriggerOffline/Top/`).\r\n\r\nTwo HLT-DQM modules of B2G were based on one of the plugins removed in this PR; these monitors have been updated to use a different plugin (`TopMonitor`); this maintains (and improves) the monitoring of those paths for B2G; the corresponding harvesting clients were updated accordingly.\r\n\r\nChanges in the comparisons are expected from the removal of the HLT-Top folders listed in [1], and the aforementioned B2G updates (two sub-folders under `HLT/B2G/Dileptonic/*`).\r\n\r\n[1]\r\n\r\n`HLT/TOP/DiElectron/`\r\n`HLT/TOP/DiMuon/`\r\n`HLT/TOP/ElecMuon/`\r\n`HLT/TOP/SemiElectronic/`\r\n`HLT/TOP/SemiMuonic/`\r\n`HLT/TOP/SingleTop/`\r\n`HLT/TopHLTValidation/`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested with `runTheMatrix.py -l 11634.0`\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\n\r\nNot a backport, and no backport of this is planned.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 41, "closed_at": "1573072375", "comments": 14, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1572867106", "deletions": 6106, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "core-approved", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "619b1aa756a2181a5d946f22b4bba8c96c57b84d", "merged_at": "1573072375", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 28343, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "[DQMOffline/Trigger] [HLTriggerOffline/Top] cleanup of HLT-DQM sequences for Top", "updated_at": "1573072375", "user": "missirol"}

The regressions are taken from the conditions database as suggested by @slava77 . We also added the option of reading from a local sqlite file. General instructions for the users are described here:\r\n\r\nhttps://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/EGMRegression\r\n\r\nWe still need a bit of work to release this product (for instance, the EGMSmearer has to be rederived for this specific regression), but the code is ready so I am doing the PR right now so that we have time to review it while these last steps are taken.\r\n\r\nA similar PR will exist for 81X and 90X but it will modify the RECO sequence as well. However, before I do these PR, I would like that my TAGS are included in the GT. I am in contact with AlCa to add them:\r\n\r\nhttps://hypernews.cern.ch/HyperNews/CMS/get/calibrations/2774.html\r\n\r\nThis PR is not supposed to have any effect in any validation step. \r\n\r\nAttention: @fcouderc , @ikrav , @gzevi \r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": "1485765082", "comments": 24, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1481473230", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 16968, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "80X EGM Regression ", "updated_at": "1485955668", "user": "rafaellopesdesa"}

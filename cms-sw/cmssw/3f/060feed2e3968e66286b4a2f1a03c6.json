The data operations are notably faster with numpy operations than with python for-loops.\r\n\r\nFollowup to: https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/48249\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI ran the notebook locally and on a large computer, and it is indeed faster. I checked all events by hand to confirm the numpy operations give identical results as the python operations. Chatgpt and gemini also approve of the approach.\r\n\r\ncc @GNiendorf @slava77 \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 7, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1750108474", "deletions": 62, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "tracking"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 48335, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Vectorize data pre-processing when training track embeddings in LST", "updated_at": "1750148400", "user": "alexandertuna"}

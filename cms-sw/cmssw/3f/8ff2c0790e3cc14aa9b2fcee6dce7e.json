Useful for the production of MC used to study the recent small systems run.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis PR was validated by generating a soft QCD sample using this option. Details for the NeNe tests using standard CMS driver commands (as well as the OO running) can be found in [this dropbox paper.](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/OO-MC-Sample--CpzSMQPfNjhOEvA5m1k3saJYAQ-5oQWgcDnV9PM22rQ5ZYDC)\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

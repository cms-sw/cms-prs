Some reasons:\r\n\r\n* Broken since at least 2015 (no consumes, it would throw)\r\n* Not compiled currently (would fail compilation since January 2023 because it's legacy)\r\n* Last substantive edit in 2010\r\n\r\nIf this is actually useful, then I could migrate but this really looks like ancient junk.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nNone. This only deletes unused files.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1706651654", "deletions": 247, "labels": ["daq-approved", "l1-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "number": 43818, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Delete last daq legacy type module", "updated_at": "1707132967", "user": "wddgit"}

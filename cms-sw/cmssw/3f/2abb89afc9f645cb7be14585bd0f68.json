This happens mainly for low pt tracks, since they have a higher possibility for very large incidence angles, not covered by the templates.\r\n\r\nSolution: The re-weighting function returns with an error in case no matching template was found. This pulls the flag `reweighted` to `false`, causing the signal to be digitized without re-weighting (see [here](https://github.com/schuetzepaul/cmssw/blob/pixelClusterChargeReweightingBugfix/SimTracker/SiPixelDigitizer/plugins/SiPixelDigitizerAlgorithm.cc#L1311)). Therefore the signal is not fully correct in terms of radiation damage, but it's not lost.\r\n\r\nAs noted in #22911 the feature of charge re-weighting is still turned of by default. It can be used with the following lines in the configuration (switching on the Re-weighting and loading the templates via the GT candidate):\r\n```\r\nfrom SimGeneral.MixingModule.pixelDigitizer_cfi import *\r\nprocess.mix.digitizers.pixel.UseReweighting = cms.bool(True)\r\n\r\nfrom Configuration.AlCa.GlobalTag import GlobalTag\r\nprocess.GlobalTag = GlobalTag(process.GlobalTag, '102X_upgrade2018_realistic_Candidate_2018_06_10_00_16_33', '')\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe validation of the simulated data with this fix is ongoing.\r\n\r\nInterested users: @tvami @tsusa @veszpv @pmaksim1 ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 0, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1528957870", "deletions": 2, "labels": [], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 23583, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Bugfix in pixel detector's cluster charge re-weighting", "updated_at": "1528957884", "user": "schuetzepaul"}

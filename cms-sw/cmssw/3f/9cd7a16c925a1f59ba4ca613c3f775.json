By default we propose to store it in the precision with 10 bits.\r\n\r\nRef: https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/44285\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nrunTheMatrix tests have been successfully run for the following workflow :\r\n runTheMatrix.py -l 12434.0\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

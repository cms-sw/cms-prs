This approach didn't prove effective in a pileup environment, and instead we implemented the chargePerCM cut in stripCPEfromTrackAngle.  I have left a null refineCluster member function that can be overwritten in a derived class to facilitate studies.\nThis PR obviates the need to address three of the four parameters cited in this JIRA ticket:\nhttps://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSTRACK-120\nsince doRefineCluster, occupancyThreshold, and widthThreshold have been removed.\nThis PR has no effect on production with the default parameters.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1424794366", "comments": 26, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1424581669", "deletions": 61, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "9eaa03849c727094d2897b1ea6117ba51799d432", "merged_at": "1424794366", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 7894, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Remove occupancy-based flagging of merged clusters", "updated_at": "1424890762", "user": "wmtford"}

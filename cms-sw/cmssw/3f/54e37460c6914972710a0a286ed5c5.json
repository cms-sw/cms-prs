The comparison is performed by filling a set of histograms from differences of several quantities that are expected to be equal within the numerical accuracy (two exceptions being \"diffNdof\" and \"diffHitPatternNumberOfLostPixelHits\", to be documented on some twiki page).\n\nI also decided to include #9564 here since it is a prerequisite and its integration hasn't progressed yet. Without it the code would sooner or later throw an exception with\n\n```\nException Message:\nAssociation: index in the map out of upper boundary\n```\n\nTested in CMSSW_7_5_X_2015-06-06-2300 with wf 11325. No other changes expected than new histograms under \"Tracking/PackedCandidate\" folder.\n\n@rovere @VinInn @arizzi @gpetruc \n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1435550754", "comments": 22, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1434434486", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "985541944f01e04ca658f8753f6a02314b9825e6", "merged_at": "1435550754", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 9630, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add module for validating tracks in miniAOD and fix track-to-PackedCandidate association", "updated_at": "1476956375", "user": "makortel"}

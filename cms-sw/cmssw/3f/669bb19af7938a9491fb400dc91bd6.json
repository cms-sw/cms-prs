I profit of this PR to add some more histograms concerning the Beam Spot monitoring to an existing analyzer and to improve the unit test suite.\r\nIn addition it fixes some miscellaneous problems in the Tracker alignment di-muon validation code:\r\n   * do not use range-based loops to create the candidate, which duplicated the entries in the histograms;\r\n   * fix the pseudo-rapidity range for creating the input histograms\r\n   * fix the inclusion of the auto-generated cfi file in the validation configuration file \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nPrivate tests, plus run successfully the augmented unit tests.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

It returns nothing with result of failing in later steps or in offline analysis when we try to access them. This is important for samples with PU=0 were the possibility to have events w/o tracks is non-negligible. \r\n   Solution: Straightforward just added the empty containers. The change is transparent, just the minimum to prevent the crashes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1664859500", "comments": 12, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1663831092", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["l1-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "upgrade-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "97723d27d71712c3c12b3b26a2e9c47abaa3f69a", "merged_at": "1664859500", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_6_X", "number": 39479, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 7, "state": "closed", "title": "Bug fix on L1TrackJetEmulator", "updated_at": "1664859500", "user": "gkaratha"}

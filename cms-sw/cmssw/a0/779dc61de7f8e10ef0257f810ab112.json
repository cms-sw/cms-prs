It returns nothing with result of failing in later steps or in offline analysis when we try to access them. This is important for samples with PU=0 were the possibility to have events w/o tracks is non-negligible. \r\n   Solution: Straightforward just added the empty containers. The change is transparent, just the minimum to prevent the crashes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1663831092", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["l1-approved", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_6_X", "number": 39479, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 7, "state": "open", "title": "Bug fix on L1TrackJetEmulator", "updated_at": "1664855839", "user": "gkaratha"}

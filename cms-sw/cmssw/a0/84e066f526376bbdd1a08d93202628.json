This is nearly the same issue as #50170 only somewhat simpler.\r\n- Fixes an uninitialized variable use in L1Trigger/CSCTriggerPrimitives by reordering a conditional to test the always initialized value first\r\n- Fixes an uninitialized variable use in L1Trigger/TrackFindingTMTT, where a pointer was being dereferenced without being initialized\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCompiles, appears to fix the relevant crashes and valgrind memcheck warnings.  No performance impacts expected.\r\n\r\nResolves https://github.com/cms-sw/framework-team/issues/1944\r\nResolves https://github.com/cms-sw/framework-team/issues/1945\r\nResolves https://github.com/cms-sw/framework-team/issues/1947\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 6, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1771533890", "deletions": 8, "labels": ["l1-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_1_X", "number": 50200, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "L1TrackJetClustering and other fixes for gcc15 crashes", "updated_at": "1771550960", "user": "dan131riley"}

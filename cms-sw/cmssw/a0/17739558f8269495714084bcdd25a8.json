Spefically:\r\n- Added `136.899` for standard cosmics processing with CRAFT2021 data\r\n - `138.1/138.2/138.3` remain unchanged (apart minor update in name) and are:\r\n   - `138.1` prompt wf on cosmics\r\n   - `138.2` express wf on cosmics\r\n   - `138.3` splashes for 2021 data\r\n- Newly introduced `138.4/138.5` are prompt and express (respectively) on 2021 collision data (MinBias, is it ok?)\r\n- Newly introduced `139.00X` cycle (as suggested by @bbilin) for standard (whatever it means) pp processing:\r\n   - `139.001` for MinBias\r\n   - `139.002` for ZeroBias\r\n   - `139.003` for HLTPhysics\r\n   - `139.004` for NoBPTX\r\n\r\n_**Important Notes:**_\r\n- ~`139.001` is failing at step4 (harvesting), see https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/36133#issuecomment-969185385  Any help would be much appreciated.~\r\n  - EDIT: fixed in 341ea11 thanks to @mmusich and @jfernan2 \r\n- ~`SimL1EmulatorRepack_Full_cff.py` has been modified to account for GEM unpacker thanks to suggestions from @missirol and @dildick, but step3 of `139.002` is still failing with the same exception (see https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/36133#issuecomment-969185696) and I don't understand why...any suggestion?~\r\n  - EDIT: fixed in 2c398a5 thanks to @dildick \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nValidation for this PR can be run with:\r\n`runTheMatrix.py -l 136.897,136.899,138.1,138.2,138.3,138.4,138.5,139.001,139.002,139.003,139.004 -j8 --ibeos`\r\n\r\n#### Backport:\r\nN/A", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1637331430", "comments": 47, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1636996468", "deletions": 28, "labels": ["dqm-approved", "l1-approved", "operations-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "pdmv-approved", "orp-approved", "upgrade-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "a52d821ff1ca408b84d5cd4b9634f8e36ecacbc2", "merged_at": "1637331430", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_2_X", "number": 36133, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add PilotBeam data in relval matrix tests", "updated_at": "1637331430", "user": "francescobrivio"}

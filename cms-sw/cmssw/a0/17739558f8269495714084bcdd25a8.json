Spefically:\r\n- Added `136.899` for standard cosmics processing with CRAFT2021 data\r\n - `138.1/138.2/138.3` remain unchanged (apart minor update in name) and are:\r\n   - `138.1` prompt wf on cosmics\r\n   - `138.2` express wf on cosmics\r\n   - `138.3` splashes for 2021 data\r\n- Newly introduced `138.4/138.4` are prompt and express (respectively) on 2021 collision data (MinBias, is it ok?)\r\n- Newly introduced `139.00X` cycle (as suggested by @bbilin) for standard (whatever it means) pp processing:\r\n   - `139.001` for MinBias\r\n   - `139.002` for ZeroBias\r\n   - `139.003` for HLTPhysics\r\n   - `139.004` for NoBPTX\r\n\r\n_**Important Notes:**_\r\n- `139.001` is failing at step4 (harvesting), see https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/36133#issuecomment-969185385  Any help would be much appreciated.\r\n- `SimL1EmulatorRepack_Full_cff.py` has been modified to account for GEM unpacker thanks to suggestions from @missirol and @dildick, but step3 of `139.002` is still failing with the same exception (see https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/36133#issuecomment-969185696) and I don't understand why...any suggestion?\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nValidation for this PR can be run with:\r\n`runTheMatrix.py -l 136.899,138.4,138.5,139.001,139.002,139.003,139.004 -j8 --ibeos`\r\nbut as stated above 139.001 and 139.002 will fail.\r\n\r\n#### Backport:\r\nN/A", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 6, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1636996468", "deletions": 24, "labels": ["operations-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_2_X", "number": 36133, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[RFC] Add PilotBeam data in relval matrix tests", "updated_at": "1636997098", "user": "francescobrivio"}

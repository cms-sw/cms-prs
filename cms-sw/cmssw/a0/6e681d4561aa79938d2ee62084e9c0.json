It adds a process modifier for automatically activating the flag \"IsSlepton\", needed for production of signal samples involving long-lived sleptons.\r\n\r\nAlso, two additional minor modifications are introduced:\r\n1. The changes added in PR #47165 are propagated to Generator3.cc.\r\n2. Flag \"IsSmuon\" is renamed to \"IsSlepton\", as it applies for selectrons as well.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with a description of the feature proposed or problem addressed, specifying:\r\n  - what changes are expected in the output if any, \r\n  - what other PRs or externals it depends upon if any,\r\n  - link to any additional material useful to provide a documentation for this PR (slides, JIRA tickets, related pull requestes, hypernews, TWiki or Indico pages)  -->\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis PR has been validated with signal samples of smuon pair production decaying to a muon and a gravitino (SMuon -> muon + G).\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with a description of which tests have been performed to verify the correctness of the PR, including the eventual addition of new code for testing like unit tests, test configurations, additions or updates to the runTheMatrix test workflows -->\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nThis PR needs to be backported (together with #47165) to 10_6_X, 12_4_X and 13_0_X for Run2 and Run3 signal sample productions.\r\n\r\n@civanch @kpedro88 @tvami @jaimeleonh ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "comments": 19, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1738076998", "deletions": 7, "labels": ["simulation-pending", "operations-approved", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_0_X", "number": 47197, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Process modifier for displaced SUSY simulation fix", "updated_at": "1738499079", "user": "24LopezR"}

For studies of the behavior of the zero suppression algorithm, it is useful to run the same code on non-zero-suppressed real data. In the case of real data, however, there are no such instance labels. This PR introduces a configuration parameter that allows for disabling instance labels in the InputTags for the digi collections so that HcalRealisticZS can be configured properly in this case.\r\n\r\nAs the default behavior is unchanged, no changes are expected in any standard workflow.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1525886212", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["code-checks-pending", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 23181, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Allow use of HCAL digi collections without instance labels in HcalRealisticZS", "updated_at": "1525886294", "user": "christopheralanwest"}

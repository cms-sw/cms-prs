This will be changed once it's in the GlobalTags.\n\nThis PR is also pending some final validation from the developer of the regression weights.\n\nAlso:\nbarrel seeding threshold goes from 3 GeV to 1 GeV\nendcap seeding threshold goes from 5 GeV to 1 Gev\nThere is a corresponding increase in superclustering timing.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 9, "closed_at": "1383038229", "comments": 30, "commits": 11, "created_at": "1380723543", "deletions": 54, "labels": ["operations-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "c247f7f158e323714fb6bd714118a5a913d310a8", "merged_at": "1383038229", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_0_0_pre8", "number": 972, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 10, "state": "closed", "title": "Apply regression corrections from database in PFECAL-SuperClusters, decrease PF-SC seeding thresholds", "updated_at": "1383038229", "user": "lgray"}

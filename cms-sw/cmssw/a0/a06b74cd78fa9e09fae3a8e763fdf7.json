In EventFilter/SiPixelRawToDigi/python/SiPixelDigiToRaw_cfi.py \"InputLabel\" is set to \"simSiPixelDigis\" and there is no PixelFEDChannelCollection with that label, instead PixelFEDChannelCollection has the label \"mix\" or \"mixData\". In order to fix the problem, the same label \"simSiPixelDigis\" is also set for PixelFEDChannelCollection in digitizer.\r\n\r\n@mmusich @tvami @leaca @veszpv", "branch": "CMSSW_10_5_X", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 0, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1551470066", "deletions": 4, "labels": [], "number": 26043, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[10_5_X] Add alias for PixelFEDChannelCollection", "updated_at": "1551470091", "user": "tsusa"}

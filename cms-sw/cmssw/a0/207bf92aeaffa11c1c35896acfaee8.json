Previously, each ME that contained a pattern in the configuration file was stored, leading to the storing of some unneeded MEs with overlapping names.\r\n\r\nMore information on the context of this PR can be found in this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VvDBvkMlKeJWKg9km30Kg3f1Lv3KB2HXE9Ne4HBbKLo/edit?usp=sharing) (note: under development, subject to change).  \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nWe performed the tests as listed [here](http://cms-sw.github.io/PRWorkflow.html) (in 'Before making your pull request').\r\nApart from that, the modified selection and configuration was used to produce nanoDQMIO files locally. No issues were observed and the content of the nanoDQMIO file in terms of ME content is as expected.\r\n\r\n#### Backport\r\n\r\nThis PR is intended for the reprocessing of 2022 data, most likely in 12_4_X.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 9, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1670580510", "deletions": 74, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "number": 40266, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "modify nanoDQMIO configuration", "updated_at": "1670917010", "user": "LukaLambrecht"}

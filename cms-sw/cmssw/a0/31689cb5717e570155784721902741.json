This is a minimal fix to the PR https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/21022 and should close this development step for the time being. We will envisage a better solution using eras in the midterm. All changes are on the level of final cfg files in test directories. Upon an independent test I confirm that tauID-related problems are indeed fixed. \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nRoger\r\n\r\n(*)\r\nhttps://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/21022#issuecomment-341917032\r\n ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 14, "closed_at": "1511453998", "comments": 21, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1509980393", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "orp-approved", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "56584e3ae63cbb5bd06e4f0f5bb396b5f681849f", "merged_at": "1511453998", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_0_X", "number": 21186, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Temporary fix of TQAF unit tests after TauID update ", "updated_at": "1511871527", "user": "roger-wolf"}

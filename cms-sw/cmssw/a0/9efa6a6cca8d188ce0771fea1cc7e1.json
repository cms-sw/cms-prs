This is in anticipation of future DQM studies which can check the track quality (called MVA1) variable among different CMSSW differences.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe changes are minimal and does not change how anything in the DQM tools are being run. I have checked that the code additions work as expected by running the DQM tools on a RelVal TTbar sample and checking the histogram outputs. All of the basic tests were run and succeeded as well.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 8, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1689628288", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "trk"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_3_X", "number": 42288, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Add track MVA1 to DQM tools for future studies", "updated_at": "1689711726", "user": "cgsavard"}

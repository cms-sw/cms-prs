This causes the DQM application to crash. This problem has been present for a few months at least, but its frequency has increased over the last few weeks.\r\n\r\nThis fix adds a try-catch block around the offending line in the DQM code so that such digis are ignored, but at least the calibration application does not crash; in addition, a detailed warning is written to the logs to help ECAL experts with more detailed troubleshooting.\r\n\r\nLink to PR for CMSSW version deployed at P5: https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/20901", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 13, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1507750576", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-rejected", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_0_X", "number": 20902, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "open", "title": "Patch to ignore events causing ECAL DQM Calibration application crashes.", "updated_at": "1516259732", "user": "tanmaymudholkar"}

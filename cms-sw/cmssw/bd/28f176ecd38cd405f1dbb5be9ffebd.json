A dR03 ID is added to the selection which adds some new taus, but altogether the number decreases.\r\n\r\nBackport to 10_6_X for nanoAOD v9 intended.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nInspected some distributions by hand which change as stated above.\r\nCode/format checks passed, unit tests passed, matrix tests passed\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1620340491", "comments": 35, "commits": 8, "created_at": "1619166240", "deletions": 35, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved", "xpog-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "353c5c347835df4ba7dfb9f01a3684329dd9e087", "merged_at": "1620340491", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "number": 33513, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 5, "state": "closed", "title": "Clean up tau related nanoAOD content", "updated_at": "1620340491", "user": "swozniewski"}

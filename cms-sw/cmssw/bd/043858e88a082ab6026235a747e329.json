This prompted me to check for their usage, and there is a misleading piece of code in the HI reco where a EcalClusterShapeFunction is created and passed around, but never actually used. It's probably better to remove this. On the way I also removed a few more unneeded includes of `EcalClusterFunctionBaseClass.h` and `EcalClusterFunctionFactory.h`, placed a few `const` and replaced a variable called `theAlgo` with `algoId`, to not get it confused for a member variable.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCMSSW compiles and local matrix tests pass.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\n\r\nNo backport intended.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 12, "closed_at": "1574452808", "comments": 20, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1574206736", "deletions": 209, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "8d6e9d8c215fb5d25195183b7c29c44fe025e473", "merged_at": "1574452808", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 28428, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "No actual use for EcalClusterShapeFunction in HiEgammaAlgos", "updated_at": "1574452808", "user": "guitargeek"}

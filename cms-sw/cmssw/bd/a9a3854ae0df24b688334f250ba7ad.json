Developers - V.Palichik and N. Voytishin\nThis algorithm shows better performance for all types of particles that can be registered by the CMS endcap muon system comparing to other existing algorithms. The best improvement is achieved for high Pt muons and events with high RecHit multiplicity in chamber.\nThe RoadUsage(RU) CSC segment building algorithm is added in the configuration files.\nThe file CSCSegmentAlgorithmRU_cfi.py contains the parameters set for the algorithm.\nIn order to use the RU algo, in line nr. 13 of the cscSegments_cfi.py file the 5th algo needs to be chosen.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1468490094", "comments": 73, "commits": 12, "created_at": "1464761213", "deletions": 48, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "0c2007c8be1e11f2b39d899ee795ad43b6abd8bb", "merged_at": "1468490094", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 14718, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 30, "state": "closed", "title": "New CSC segment builder - RoadUsage(RU)", "updated_at": "1468490095", "user": "nvoytish"}

This would solve the visualization issues when displaying these in the GUI overlaid with a previous run. \r\nI leave the possibility to produce histograms instead via a dedicated configuration flag, since that might be useful when run in standalone mode. Additionally I restrict the range of the &mu;&mu; pair  &Delta;&eta; for the Z&mu;&mu; case.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI've run successfully the unit tests  of this packages via `scram b runtests_testDiMuonVertexMonitor use-ibeos`\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

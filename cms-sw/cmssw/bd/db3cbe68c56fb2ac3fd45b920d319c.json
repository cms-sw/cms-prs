It looks like that these two places were not accessed with the standard configuration (and in fact there are no changes in reco outputs in jenkins) but they must be fixed anyhow.\r\n\r\n@drkovalskyi @folguera ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1510684897", "comments": 25, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1510302070", "deletions": 13, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "f7af67c1261982a1b877b4d11c8182ebf201fe03", "merged_at": "1510684897", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_0_X", "number": 21251, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Solve static check issues and bugs for reco muon tracking tools", "updated_at": "1510817378", "user": "perrotta"}

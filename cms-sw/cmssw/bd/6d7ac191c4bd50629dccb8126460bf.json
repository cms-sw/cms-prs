Please see for a presentation on its development:\r\n\r\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/594656/contributions/2403265/attachments/1390281/2117550/nmccoll_12_16_16_ME0Newsigis.pdf#search=Mc%20Coll\r\n\r\nWhile it is useful for granularity/neutron/# of layer studies, I added in a feature to simply use the granularity as defined by the geometry. This allows for the digitization, and merging, of hits as expected for the ME0 granularity. It also adds a new collection, which is simply a map of integers...pointing from input digi index to new digi index. Since we filter and merge inputs, it is a many to one map with empty entries.\r\n\r\n(moved from: https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/18112)", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1491125989", "comments": 34, "commits": 9, "created_at": "1490744202", "deletions": 279, "labels": ["comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-approved", "upgrade-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "04fee3df126b9acdd18a72dffbcefadfbce8c2f7", "merged_at": "1491125989", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_1_X", "number": 18113, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 34, "state": "closed", "title": "ME0 pseudo digitizer update", "updated_at": "1491128320", "user": "nickmccoll"}

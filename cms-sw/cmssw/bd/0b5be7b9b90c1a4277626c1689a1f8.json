The model is trained with the flat-m(H) HH4Q samples and QCD samples (same as used in the ParticleNet-MD tagger), and uses the same ParticleNet architecture. The training target is the generated particle mass for the Higgs jets, and gen-jet soft drop mass for the QCD jets. The resulting regressed mass shows a significant improvement in the mass resolution compared to the soft drop mass and also reduces the tails at low/high SD mass values. This new algorithm is being used by the full Run2 VHcc merged-jet topology analysis and the VBF HH4b boosted analysis and brings significant gain in sensitivity. More details of the algorithm can be found in the talks at [ML Forum](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1001994/contributions/4242705/attachments/2205712/3731859/ML%20forum%20-%20ParticleNet%20for%20jet%20tagging%20and%20mass%20regression.pdf) and [JMAR](https://indico.cern.ch/event/998668/#80-large-radius-jet-mass-regre).\r\n\r\nThis algorithm is requested to be included in NanoAODv9 by a few analyses. Therefore, a new training using the UL samples is performed and used in this PR. The performance of the UL training is summarized in [this presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1M-CitzrkEGFhrUQH6ut1WZTZvJacTL4siGS74EXHpM8/edit#slide=id.g7f9c7af312_0_1). \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nValidated with a UL NanoAOD workflow. \r\n\r\nMemory/time increase should be the same as `pfMassDecorrelatedParticleNetJetTags` as the network architecture is the same, i.e., ~20M and ~30ms per high pT AK8 jet.\r\n\r\n@selvaggi @gouskos @pmaksim1", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1620382282", "comments": 25, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1618954505", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "requires-external", "tests-approved", "xpog-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "074f0c69af4f4669623b0ef33c8c73f73d8d287f", "merged_at": "1620382282", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "number": 33483, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 7, "state": "closed", "title": "Add ParticleNet mass regression", "updated_at": "1620382282", "user": "hqucms"}

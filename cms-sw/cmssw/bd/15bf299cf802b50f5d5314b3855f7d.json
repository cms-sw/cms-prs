The changes are the exact copy of the other perturbation for \"Lpx\". The correction was suggested by J. Kaspar.\r\n\r\nAt line 174 the parameter \"a\" has been update to 2.66 instead of 0.42. The simple calculation is\r\n\r\n                 a = delta(dLy/ds) / delta(xi) = (0.24 %) / (0.14 - 0.05 ) = 2.66 % \r\n\r\nthe change of the uncertainty band with xi (in percent).

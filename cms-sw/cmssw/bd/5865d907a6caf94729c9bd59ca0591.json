Tested if each one of the files would load properly in python. A few failed because of a file in <SubSystem>/<Package>/python which had the same name as the generated 'module construction' file. I made PRs changing those file names.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 23, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1710509756", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["core-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 44424, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[RFC] Be able to generate dummy _cfi.py files for ConfDB parsing", "updated_at": "1711461445", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

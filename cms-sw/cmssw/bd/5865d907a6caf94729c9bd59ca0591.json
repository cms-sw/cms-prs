Tested if each one of the files would load properly in python. A few failed because of a file in <SubSystem>/<Package>/python which had the same name as the generated 'module construction' file. I made PRs changing those file names.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1716208271", "comments": 32, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1710509756", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "e95546f0a9c574532fe038a6483fb99e0a98a7b7", "merged_at": "1716208271", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 44424, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Be able to generate dummy _cfi.py files for ConfDB parsing", "updated_at": "1716208272", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

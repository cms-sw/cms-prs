It is meant to be used with Powheg samples containing taus so that no Powheg events are lost.\r\nSince DecayHandler is meant to decay one particle at a time, while the standard Pythia tau decayer decays the correlated pair, part of the decay history is saved and then used to fill the products of the second (correlated) tau.\r\n\r\nNote that code-format makes this PR look bigger than it is.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nValidation plots for W and Z, things look as expected: https://mseidel.web.cern.ch/mseidel/cms/PDG_TAUS/\r\n\r\nIn particular, here is the number of tau->charged lepton decays in Z events:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1311783/81648578-37dfa980-942f-11ea-87d3-7255cd1eeee7.png)\r\nAs expected, 0 lepton is depleted completely, and the ratio betwen 1 and 2 leptons stays the same.\r\n\r\nTo check spin correlations, here is a plot of the dPhi between the two charged leptons, in case of both taus decaying to charged leptons:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1311783/81648708-6a89a200-942f-11ea-9ae7-1e2d2228ea32.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nBackport of #29567, needed for UL MC\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1589298855", "comments": 9, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1589268678", "deletions": 685, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "generators-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "0a20a214609a5f3d98672bb4d62c045e0ab38b5e", "merged_at": "1589298855", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 29808, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Backport of #29567 (biased tau decayer) to CMSSW_10_6_X", "updated_at": "1589298855", "user": "intrepid42"}

The previous implementation sometimes reported helpers within the DQMStore, or functions with missing debug symbols that could not be printed. With these improvements, it gives a meaningful attribution for all histogram bookings.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1457457348", "comments": 8, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1456392024", "deletions": 9, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "dc9190210b4328850b5dde0c7deb2cf2ccffc439", "merged_at": "1457457348", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 13475, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Improve print_trace in DQMStore", "updated_at": "1457457348", "user": "schneiml"}

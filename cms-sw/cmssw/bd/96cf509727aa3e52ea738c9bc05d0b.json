The current pull request has been announced since we started the overall integration campaign and discussed e.g. in the last RECO/AT meeting (*).\n\nThe following changes are only small modifications to files to enable the plugin for readout from pat::Taus:\n- RecoTauTag/RecoTau/interface/AntiElectronIDMVA6.h\n- RecoTauTag/RecoTau/src/AntiElectronIDMVA6.cc\n\nThe following files have been added to form the new plugin:\n- RecoTauTag/RecoTau/plugins/PATTauDiscriminationAgainstElectronMVA6.cc\n- RecoTauTag/RecoTau/python/PATTauDiscriminationAgainstElectronMVA6_cfi.py\n\nThe last two files contain modifications that have been made for our internal testing of the new (-> from miniAOD) and old (-> from AOD/standard) readout and to proof in a unit test that both lead to the same output:\n- RecoTauTag/RecoTau/test/rerunMVAIsolationOnMiniAOD.cc\n- RecoTauTag/RecoTau/test/rerunMVAIsolationOnMiniAOD.py \n\nSimilar statements apply as for https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/15778: the code changes concern code that is run on user level. They are detached from standard reconstruction sequences. In addition this pull request makes use of the infrastructure that has been introduced for https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/15778. It thus is not as extended as I had thought initially. \n\nUsual tests have been made and no problems have been spotted. Additional tests that we do internally have been positive. We do not expect any change to the outcome of existing RelVal tests. This PR (for the time being) closes the development cycle we expected for 81X in spring this year. Thanx a lot for the quick integration of the preceding PR's, on which this one relies.\n\nCheers,\nRoger\n\n(*)\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/570119/contributions/2305878/attachments/1340889/2019361/TauPOG-2016-09-21-RECO-AT.pdf\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1476456195", "comments": 20, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1475132720", "deletions": 24, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved", "urgent"], "merge_commit_sha": "4200ba2f5fc8e480399005d59d70b667fd5b2618", "merged_at": "1476456195", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 16030, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 6, "state": "closed", "title": "Extension of infrastructure to readout tau discriminators from miniAOD to anti-electron discriminator", "updated_at": "1487932736", "user": "roger-wolf"}

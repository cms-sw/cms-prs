Over 500 CMSSW macros do not compile in ROOT6. Since that is too many macros to be fixed centrally, it was decided by David Lange to centrally fix only those 45 macros with compilation errors that have been modified since the switch over to git, since those are the ones most likely to be used. Several of these 45 macros are in the Analysis L2 category. This pull request fixes them.\nNote: While this PR fixes all the compilation errors in these macros, one macro, MultiHistoOverlap_Upsilon.C still has a link error that I was not able to easily fix. Still, the fact that now compiles is an improvement.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 9, "closed_at": "1431367566", "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1429031244", "deletions": 102, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "77c576b8912eaf2b93a4bfc3125c60486bd8ed48", "merged_at": "1431367565", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 8743, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Macros need to compile in ROOT6 (Analysis) (7_4_X)", "updated_at": "1431368904", "user": "wmtan"}

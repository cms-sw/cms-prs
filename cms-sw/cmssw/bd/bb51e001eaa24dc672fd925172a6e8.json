Otherwise, the generation is controlled by R and R is sampled in the range `[RMin, RMax]` \r\n- this PR also fixes a bug introduced by #36460\r\n   - https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/36460/files#diff-40127cfb5d2379d718d6b82ffc0d5e900b6eeb1bae875f44fa81f63655e06365R84 `PartID` should be taken randomly from `fPartIDs`, instead was sampled between [0, `fPardIDs.size()`].

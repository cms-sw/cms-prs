I also checked that a  2026 upgrade workflow still runs correctly. Running with the new geometry requires changes upstream of geometry and will be made later.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with any link to  -->\r\n\r\nBefore submitting your pull requests, make sure you followed this checklist:\r\n- verify that the PR is really intended for the chosen branch\r\n- verify that changes follow [CMS Naming, Coding, And Style Rules](http://cms-sw.github.io/cms_coding_rules.html)\r\n- verify that the PR passes the basic test procedure suggested in the [CMSSW PR instructions](https://cms-sw.github.io/PRWorkflow.html)\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 8, "closed_at": "1589263321", "comments": 42, "commits": 10, "created_at": "1588578338", "deletions": 60, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "671524010b9ea977f7cc6d1ba2f14e72d62d8832", "merged_at": "1589263320", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 29624, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 20, "state": "closed", "title": "GE0 geometry builder", "updated_at": "1589263321", "user": "watson-ij"}

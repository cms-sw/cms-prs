Use this information StripCPEfromTrackAngle to fall back to the larger \"legacy\" CPE errors for these clusters. The flag lives on the high bit of the firstStrip_ private data member of the SiStripCluster. Configurable thresholds in the sensor occupancy and strip width are used to discriminate between un- and merged candidates. The cluster refiner is turned off as configured for this PR. (Note that it's also overridden by useLegacyError = cms.bool(True) in StripCPEfromTrackingAngle_cfi.)\n\nI'm closing PR #6348, which was based on 7_2_0_pre6, in favor of this one, based on 7_3_0_pre2, though I haven't tested execution in this release.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_3_X", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1416138118", "comments": 27, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1415768836", "deletions": 8, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "1b5ca285bb638a677b349bc5f03cda0e3e109d6e", "merged_at": "1416138118", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_3_X", "number": 6349, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 18, "state": "closed", "title": "Flag merged clusters for relaxed CPE errors", "updated_at": "1416851744", "user": "wmtford"}

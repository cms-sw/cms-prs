The main reason for this is that PUPPI treats particles with fromPV1&2 different than CHS.  It was found that PUPPI rejects one prong hadronic taus that most of the time has `fromPV==2` and `pT < 20 GeV` (`pT > 20 GeV` are protected by PUPPI already). This PR is supposed to recover the loss of hadronic tau candidates by keeping charged particles with `pT > 4 GeV` and `fromPV==2` while maintaining the jet energy resolution, eff and purity for jets. A comparison of different options was done in this presentation: https://indico.cern.ch/event/1364503/#5-puppi-tau-tune\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\npasses the usual runTheMatrix test: `runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos`", "branch": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1712125833", "comments": 13, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1711577746", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "backport-ok", "tau", "jetmet"], "merge_commit_sha": "d6a355d36bf41d36b13f79019bba03390896abe2", "merged_at": "1712125833", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "number": 44566, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "[Puppi] Backport of #44050 (Hadronic tau recovery with protection for fromPV==2 charged particles) to 14_0_X", "updated_at": "1712125834", "user": "nurfikri89"}

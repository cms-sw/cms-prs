Tested if cmssw well compiles with new codes (scram b) : works fine\r\n2. Followed \"before making your pull request\" and \"code quality checks\" part on this link : http://cms-sw.github.io/PRWorkflow.html\r\n3. Ran Muon HLT ntupler with new classifier added, checked it working fine.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

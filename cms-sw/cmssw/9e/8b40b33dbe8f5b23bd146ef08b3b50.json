For the same reason, it cannot be tested with the present workflows or addon tests (this is just FYI). \n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1390471964", "comments": 20, "commits": 8, "created_at": "1389867054", "deletions": 12, "labels": ["fully-signed", "hlt-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "d2b70a286136df519808fa77a1550341407b2035", "merged_at": "1390471964", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_0_0", "number": 2042, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fixed new fast pv3", "updated_at": "1402973210", "user": "perrotta"}

Specifically, it runs on top of the RAW+RECO data tier to allow analyzers to access detailed hit information (RECO) and to use the dataset for analysis R&D (RAW), such as ML and other reconstruction improvements.\r\n\r\nWe have realized that the needs of the EXO analyses differ in a non-negligible way from the existing JME HighMET skim [1]. The JME goals with such a skim are to study the behavior of high-MET tail and to develop and test different noise cleaning strategies. They have found for example that the RAW data tier is not so relevant for their use-case. They also don't need all the events collected for this purpose.\r\n\r\nThe proposed skim selects events on or near the plateau of the MET trigger efficiency, with MET pT > 200 GeV. There is currently no additional filter on the event content of the skim. The skim rate as tested on a file in the MET 2018A dataset is 2.7%, selecting 194 out of 7219 events.\r\n\r\nThis skim will be useful for several analyses, for example [2]:\r\n\r\n- Delayed jets (EXO-19-001)\r\n- Inelastic dark matter (EXO-20-010)\r\n- Disappearing tracks (EXO-19-010)\r\n- LLP hadronic decays in the ECAL\r\n- Fractionally charged particles (EXO-19-006)\r\n- Heavy Stable Charged Particles (HSCP)\r\n\r\nAnd we believe others will also benefit from it.\r\n\r\n[1] https://indico.cern.ch/event/1042443/contributions/4379421/attachments/2257197/3831154/HighMETSkim_JME_3June2021.pdf\r\n\r\n[2] https://indico.cern.ch/event/1086811/contributions/4568933/attachments/2329715/3969638/EXO_skim_plans_run3_JME_20211018.pdf\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis has been verified on CMSSW_12_4_0_pre3 with two test configs: `Configuration/Skimming/test/test_EXOHighMET_onQCD_cfg.py` and `Configuration/Skimming/test/test_EXOHighMET_onData_cfg.py`. Both in terms of number of events and file size, we get a roughly 2.7% rate on data. For completeness, we also test on a very high pT QCD MC sample, and here the skim rate is 12%.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1652076950", "comments": 16, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1651262465", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["fully-signed", "tests-approved", "pdmv-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "fb4cb761046e2a1d8b7b3cee48145ae4f4505f88", "merged_at": "1652076950", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 37749, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Skim EXO HighMET", "updated_at": "1652076950", "user": "afrankenthal"}

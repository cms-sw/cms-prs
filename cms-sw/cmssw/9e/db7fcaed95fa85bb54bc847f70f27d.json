If those plugins are actually there, nothing is\nchanged since the local cache file has precedence. If the plugin was not\nbuilt, e.g. it was removed in the local area, the plugin manager will\ncomplain about not finding the library specified by the dummy entry.\n\nThis patch alone will not introduce any change in behavior and will\nrequire scram to generate the poison file in order to turn on the new\nfunctionality.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_3_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1415266026", "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1415200385", "deletions": 8, "labels": ["comparison-available", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "8e5e3d99b56dac2f379bd5f7149b9868235d23cb", "merged_at": "1415266026", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_3_X", "number": 6220, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add support for noticing and complaining about removed plugins.", "updated_at": "1415266026", "user": "ktf"}

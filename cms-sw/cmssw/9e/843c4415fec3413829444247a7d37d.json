This lead to PR https://github.com/dmwm/T0/pull/5025 where these producers are removed from the from Raw Prime PDs to reduce output volume.\r\nTo avoid having to manually change again Tier0 configuration in the future, I propose this PR to allow prescales in `AlCaRecoTriggerBits` for the two mentioned producers.\r\n This follows the same pattern used for https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/42965. \r\n \r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n`runTheMatrix.py -l 1000.0 -t 4 -j 8` runs fine.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

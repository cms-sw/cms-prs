The PNet training used currently in the DQM (older training) is not supported for Puppi, only for CHS jets. The new training for 13-0-X is only evaluated at the MiniAOD level, not at RECO, and for this reason, we revert to using CHS jets for the DQM monitoring.\r\n\r\nBackports needed in:\r\nCMSSW_13_1_X\r\nCMSSW_13_0_X", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 5, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1684236279", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "bug-fix", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_2_X", "number": 41694, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Reverting to AK4 CHS jets for DQM PNet monitoring", "updated_at": "1684237242", "user": "marinakolosova"}

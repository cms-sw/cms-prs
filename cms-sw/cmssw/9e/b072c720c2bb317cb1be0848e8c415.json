This is needed for proton-lead data and MC in 80X.  This also includes a customization that modifies the tracking cluster limits \nThis python script also contains a function that modifies the limits on the number of clusters for the pp tracking.  That was implemented in 75X for reprocessing of peripheral PbPb data.  I deactivated it by default, since the customization in 80X is intended for pPb, not PbPb.  \n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1467741353", "comments": 20, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1467186944", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "91dd7efa036ae00cee30b78effad98de5ef1d58e", "merged_at": "1467741353", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 15048, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "Customization of pp reco for heavy ions (backport from 81X)", "updated_at": "1467741353", "user": "mandrenguyen"}

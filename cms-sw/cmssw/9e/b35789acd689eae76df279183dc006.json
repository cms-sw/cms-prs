The change will affect the cluster charge distribution for L1, the lower edge will shift from 2000\r\nto 4000e.\r\n\r\n![Cluster_charge](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4885289/136060774-786b1fe4-bb8b-45f8-a22c-677a7ce85dcb.jpg)\r\n\r\nIn addition, the PR sets the `SiPixelClusterProducer` `ChannelThreshold` at the HLT to 10 to make it in sync with the offline reconstruction.\r\n\r\nThis is a resubmission of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/35506 with the additional Run 3 modifiers for the GPU code and the related HLT modifiers.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRun RECO on raw data from the cosmic run 344420.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nNo backport needed.\r\n\r\n@dkotlins @mmusich \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 33, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1633290144", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "hlt-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "number": 35518, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Increase SiPixel L1 cluster threshold from 2000 to 4000e, synchronize channel threshold between HTL and offline", "updated_at": "1633443256", "user": "ferencek"}

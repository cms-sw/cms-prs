This is to avoid ambiguity as to whether the muon passing the HLT really did pass the correct L1 trigger as well, a necessary assumption to factorize the L1 and HLT efficiencies.  This was discussed with Hugues Brun, muon HLT contact.\n\nPractically this has very little impact.  I tested on a few thousand Wmunu MC events and saw no difference compared to the previous behavior.  \n\nThe code is backwards compatible - if no L1 collection is given, no L1 matching is attempted.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_3_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1414781498", "comments": 8, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1414758863", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "fully-signed", "hlt-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "e6dff5fb5c57ad31160d2b12b675ec9fbb2f5264", "merged_at": "1414781498", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_3_X", "number": 6137, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Explicit L1 match in single tkmu trigger", "updated_at": "1414783857", "user": "olivito"}

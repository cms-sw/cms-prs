This is possible because we're actually saving the `hltOnlineMetaDataDigis` to `DQMOnlineScouting` stream (see also [CMSHLT-3585](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSHLT-3585)).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n`scram b runtests_TestDQMOnlineClient-scouting_dqm_sourceclient` runs fine and without warnings.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nNot a backport, but it will be backported to CMSSW_15_0_X for data-taking operations.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 6, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1753771328", "deletions": 215, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "hlt-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 48646, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Improvements to `ScoutingCollectionMonitor`", "updated_at": "1753771946", "user": "mmusich"}

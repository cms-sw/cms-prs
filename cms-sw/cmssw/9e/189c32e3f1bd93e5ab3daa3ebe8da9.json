This PR fixes the issue.\r\n\r\nThe attached plots show the compressed ET in data versus emulation for ieta=16 before and after this fix for a run in which charge is injected into individual channels of HEP17 one at a time.\r\n\r\nThis PR should have no effect on data or MC samples that do not include an upgraded HE. For MC samples with an upgraded HE, the effect should still be essentially negligible; the fix is needed primarily to resolve spurious data vs. emulation discrepancies.\r\n\r\n[run297917_ieta16_before_fix.pdf](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/files/1138725/run297917_ieta16_before_fix.pdf)\r\n[run297917_ieta16_after_fix.pdf](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/files/1138727/run297917_ieta16_after_fix.pdf)\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1499870205", "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1499766314", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "3ad8a88ea3b9fbc6a43fd6e821cf75046d2b1266", "merged_at": "1499870205", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_3_X", "number": 19679, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix TP ET emulation for ieta=16", "updated_at": "1499879656", "user": "christopheralanwest"}

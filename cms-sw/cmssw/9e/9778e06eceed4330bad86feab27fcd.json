Per @l-cadamuro 's suggestion I changed the `deg_to_rad` function back to the definition in https://github.com/cms-l1t-offline/cmssw/blob/l1t-phase2-v2.37.2/L1Trigger/L1TTrackMatch/interface/L1TkMuMantra.h#L85. \r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested the TP, DynamicWindows and ManTra versions on 2900 events in `/store/mc/Phase2HLTTDRSummer20ReRECOMiniAOD/DYToLL_M-50_TuneCP5_14TeV-pythia8/FEVT/NoPU_pilot_111X_mcRun4_realistic_T15_v1-v1/100000/FE80A42E-0B59-FD45-A1E5-56A34EFA3DB9.root`. Tested the ManTra version again after the fix on the same sample. Efficiency plots can be found here: https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSLITDPG-908.

There is a similar LHEPtFilter, but it only filters outgoing particles. This filter does the filtering on intermediate particles. For example, for a boosted Higgs, we would like to filter on the pT of the Higgs (not the final state partons). The current LHEPtFilter does not do that. This doesn't affect any other PRs or external code. \r\n\r\n(An attempt to extend the current LHEPtFilter was made instead of adding this filter, but difficulties were encountered with the plugin and I hope to get this addition added soon so we can ask for a small production of the sample.)\r\n\r\nI would like to backport this also to 10_6_X to that it can be used for a Run 2 UL thesis.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 15, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1670363254", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["generators-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "number": 40254, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 8, "state": "open", "title": "add filter for intermediate resonance particles", "updated_at": "1670859112", "user": "jieunyoo"}

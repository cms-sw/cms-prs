By default for >= CMSSW_10_3_0_pre5, the pulse shape data are fetched from DB and the hard-coded values are ignored. The restoration of the hard-coded thresholds are to needed in case an expert tries to use the Phase-I compatibility mode of the class, which is not using the DB, and tries to evaluate the shape(time) on its own. The thresholds are not explicitly used by the Digitization/Reconstruction code of CMSSW.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1541866038", "comments": 12, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1541760980", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "287e9f7064a38e06c753afff7f0814ab8499b5d8", "merged_at": "1541866038", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_4_X", "number": 25170, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "restoring ecal pulse shape hard-coded-thresholds when not using DB", "updated_at": "1541866038", "user": "theofil"}

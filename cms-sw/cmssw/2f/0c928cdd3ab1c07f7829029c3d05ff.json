This scenario is not considered by any relval, as far as I know, so the HI group should confirm that this works as expected.\r\nAs I understood, there is no plan to use virgin raw for the upcoming HI run, but we are submitting this bugfix to have it in place just in case.\r\n\r\nCC: @icali (I cannot find Andre on github, could you ping him?) @alesaggio ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 10, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1539328842", "deletions": 13, "labels": ["code-checks-pending", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_4_X", "number": 24851, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "open", "title": "Regional strip unpacker: support for legacy modes and bugfix for virgin raw", "updated_at": "1539589573", "user": "pieterdavid"}

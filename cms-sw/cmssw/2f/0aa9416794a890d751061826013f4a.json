I expect nothing will change in the output or behavior of anything.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRelies on existing unit tests.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1607418192", "comments": 14, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1607359668", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-rejected"], "merge_commit_sha": "d15e2fb82230ee493af848444caaefc6aa9dadb1", "merged_at": "1607418192", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 32405, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix debug compilation, GCC900 for FWCore/Utilities", "updated_at": "1607418192", "user": "wddgit"}

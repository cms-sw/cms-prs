I'm planning to introduce new vertex associator(s) (separating it out from vertex validation code), and to use them in vertex and track validation code.\n\nOn the same go, the definitions of `reco::VertexBaseRef`, `reco::VertexSimToRecoCollection`, and `VertexRecoToSimCollection` were moved to more proper places (the first one pulls quite a lot of packages...).\n\nTested in CMSSW_7_5_X_2015-05-12-2300. No changes expected in results.\n\n@rovere @VinInn \n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 36, "closed_at": "1432677432", "comments": 16, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1432277418", "deletions": 363, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "1750fcd75543b31a5bfad9e56ae2001b3c64129e", "merged_at": "1432677432", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 9223, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Transform VertexAssociatorByTracks to EDProduct style", "updated_at": "1476956329", "user": "makortel"}

For these reasons, we add new gen fragments and will later create a JIRA ticket with the relevant RelVal requests to the PdmV group. Two things to notice, as PdmV told us (@siddhesh86 ) : \r\n- Since separate workflows with unique numbers would be preferred as all the relvals can be submitted in one go, we have added the GEN fragments we wish to use. \r\n- In all cases we tried to stay with a name of low string length, since high string length names  are not getting submitted lately. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, we are shooting in front of: \r\n- The scintillator part of CE-H Coarse.\r\n- The silicon part of CE-H Coarse.\r\n- CE-H Fine in the 3 different thicknesses of Silicon cells.\r\n- CE-E in the 3 different thicknesses of Silicon cells. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nWe have used in the past the CloseByParticleGun with a pair of unconverted photons for calibration studies [1]. \r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\n\r\nThis is not a backport. \r\n\r\n@rovere @felicepantaleo @amartelli @gouskos @siddhesh86\r\n\r\n[1] https://indico.cern.ch/event/813555/contributions/3400815/attachments/1831509/2999508/Psallidas-Checks.pdf\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 9, "closed_at": "1565029014", "comments": 18, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1564400107", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "generators-approved", "orp-approved", "pdmv-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "839c333ba6d070b8f6e4a0fbb453b3ac947baa49", "merged_at": "1565029014", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27631, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "[HGCal] New fragments for special HGCal RelVal requests", "updated_at": "1565029015", "user": "apsallid"}

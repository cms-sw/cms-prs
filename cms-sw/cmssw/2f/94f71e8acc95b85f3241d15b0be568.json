This causes most release validation tests in ROOT6 to fail.  This pull request adds a specification for the two enumerations.  The relvals will still fail for a different reason, but that does not remove the need for this absolutely critical fix.\nPlease merge this pull request before the next IB if at all possible.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_ROOT6_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1423509072", "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1423508576", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["alca-pending", "comparison-pending", "db-pending", "l1-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "a907998c306c83d17aad9567e96bc4e2f4582080", "merged_at": "1423509072", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "number": 7638, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "ROOT6 needs to know about enumerations", "updated_at": "1423510164", "user": "wmtan"}

We intend this as a first PR to request feedback and comments. It includes contributions from @alexstrel that were squashed in during the porting to 14_2.\r\n\r\nThe content of the PR was previously discussed on:\r\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/1442046/#4-status-of-offline-vertexing\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nWhen running the code-checks there are several warnings such as:\r\n\r\n> >> Processing tmp/el9_amd64_gcc12/code-checks/RecoVertex/PrimaryVertexProducer_Alpaka/plugins/alpaka/PrimaryVertexProducer_Alpaka.cc.yaml\r\n>   Deleting: No Diagnostics found\r\n> \r\n\r\nwhich I'm not sure about their origin.

The difference is more in EB than EE.\r\n EGM report here : https://indico.cern.ch/event/1340058/contributions/5641368/attachments/2742887/4771900/Photon_scEta_difference.pdf\r\nFrom Hgg analysis team, similar difference in the supercluster Eta has also been seen. \r\nHgg report here[Slide 8] : https://indico.cern.ch/event/1233738/contributions/5474144/attachments/2675923/4640510/2023_LMComparions_UL18_Hgg.pdf\r\nSince it is an important variable, we think it may be stored in NanoAOD.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nrunTheMatrix tests have been successfully run for the following workflow :\r\n\r\n- runTheMatrix.py -l 12434.0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Backport\r\nWe target this to go in Nano V13 for now. backport might be  required if the Nano production happens in the earlier CMSSW release.\r\n\r\nTagging EGM L2 convenors @a-kapoor and @RSalvatico \r\nHgg convenors @lfinco , @fcouderc, @JaLuka98", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1699265355", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "xpog-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_3_X", "number": 43198, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Add superclusterEta of photon in NANOAOD", "updated_at": "1699278518", "user": "Prasant1993"}

Delta t is initialised to zero. This behaviour was enforced by adding spurious IOVs in the database. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nCheck that delta t was properly propagated from the plugin EcalLaserCorrectionService to EcalLaserServiceDb the EcalLaserService and t_laser is properly set for events with t.< t3 and t > t3 + delta\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1593230629", "comments": 54, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1592249260", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["alca-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "hlt-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 30254, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 6, "state": "closed", "title": "Protection for extrapolation of laser correction", "updated_at": "1593230629", "user": "fcouderc"}

This workflow was added specifically to test the PPS reco (#32765).\r\n\r\nBrief summary of the history:\r\n- #32003 has integrated the PPS digi in CMSSW\r\n- this caused the error `No 'LHCInfoRcd' record found in the EventSetup.n` (#32340)\r\n- so we temporary removed ctppsProtons from recoCTPPSTask (Run-3 only) #32352\r\n- if I understand correctly from #32356, the `LHCInfoRcd` has been added in the GT. \r\n- the new \"dynamic conditions\" (#32207) will not be used for the time being.\r\n\r\nReverts cms-sw/cmssw#32352\r\n\r\n@mundim @fabferro @jan-kaspar @cms-sw/alca-l2 @cms-sw/reconstruction-l2 \r\n\r\nPS.

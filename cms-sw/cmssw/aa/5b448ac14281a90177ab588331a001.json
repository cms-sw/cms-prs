Should correspond to no greater than 100k events (estimate from 2018 data puts it at ~20k). To be applied to the hadronic physics PDs (i.e. not HIForward/UPCs).\r\n\r\n@mandrenguyen \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested in CMSSW_14_2_X_2024-10-20-0000, compiles and appears to run when tested w/ runTheMatrix.py -l 142.0 -n -e, modifying step 3 to include the newly defined PbPbHighPtJets skim as:\r\n```\r\n-s RAW2DIGI,L1Reco,RECO,SKIM:PbPbHighPtJets,PAT\r\n```\r\nThe output appears correctly sensitive to specified trigger path and threshold cuts. \r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

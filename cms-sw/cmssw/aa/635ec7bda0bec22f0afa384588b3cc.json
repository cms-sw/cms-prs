This PR fixes this problem.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nRan the unit tests for the PixBary job:\r\n```\r\nscram b\r\ncd Alignment/OfflineValidation/test\r\n./testingScripts/validateAlignments.sh\r\n./testingScripts/test_unitPixBary.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

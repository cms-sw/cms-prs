And it make a segmentation fault during the test.\r\n* To avoid the problem, we asked the module to check GE+2/1 chamber 16 layer 2 which is in the geometry since 2022 instead of the ghost chamber.\r\n* A backport to CMSSW_14_0_X is needed.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n* The change is tested with the customized geometry which is basically 2023 geometry, but changing gem21 to 2024 scenario.\r\n* The code format passed with `scram b code-format` and `scram b code-checks`\r\n\r\n@watson-ij @bsunanda ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1708927582", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["l1-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 44083, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[GEM][bug fix] avoid the segmentation fault caused by the 2024 GEMGeometry", "updated_at": "1708955519", "user": "yeckang"}

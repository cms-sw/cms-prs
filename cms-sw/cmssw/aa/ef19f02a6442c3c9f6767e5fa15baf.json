This can be useful for e.g. MVA training to have a single branch telling if a track is true or fake, and to reduce the size of the ntuple.\r\n\r\nAlso an example script `analyseMVA.py` plotting the MVA and the input variables is added to serve as a starting point for further studies.\r\n\r\nTested in 9_1_0_pre3, no impact on standard workflows.\r\n\r\n@rovere @VinInn @hajohajo", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1499016320", "comments": 11, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1497611950", "deletions": 101, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "72e9f449382455b68638c3fcfb990ba13aad70ee", "merged_at": "1499016320", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_3_X", "number": 19281, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add track selection MVA and all the input variables to TrackingNtuple", "updated_at": "1499016320", "user": "makortel"}

No test is added to the standard matrix, as the workflows is fully functional up to GEN-SIM, the RECO geometry needs to be updated. Anyway the availability of the definition is useful to perform tests and debugging;\r\n\r\n- update of Validation/Geometry adding the materials needed by the new ETL. This allows the user to produce material budget plots for the new scenario D53, showing the increase in the ETL region due to the double disk structure.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4058194/73515733-9f309b00-43f6-11ea-95d5-db0b0db4b9d5.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe produced material budget plot is linked above.

Only GEMEtaPartitions were made properly before with GEMSuperChambers and GEMChambers using the same dimensions as GEMEtaPartitions (ME0 is still like this). This wasnt an issue before as chambers were not used.\n- had wrong local to global direction in half of the chambers due to odd and even chambers have different rotations\n- made Geometry/GEMGeometryBuilder/data/GEMSpecsFilter.xml, this needs to be added for all geometries using GEM so that GEMGeometryBuilderFromDDD can find GEMChamber and its associated GEMEtaPartitions \n\nfixed GeometryExtended2015MuonGEMDev so that we can run full muon upgrade software in 81X\n\nGEMDetId.h\n- used layer = 0 for superChamber (better to have separate DetId for super chamber and chamber)\n- needed 1 more bit for layer, which results in a change in the rawID\n- added superChamberId() function\n\nGEMGeometry.h \n- better superChamber() function\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 10, "closed_at": "1462357152", "comments": 15, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1461936057", "deletions": 232, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "e3767a48bc448a7347b0e3e9b0230c993af8cced", "merged_at": "1462357152", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 14305, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 4, "state": "closed", "title": "Gem Geometry fix for 81x", "updated_at": "1462357152", "user": "jshlee"}

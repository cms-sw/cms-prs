Isolation for the case of photons is computed based on particleFlow collection, and \"reducedEgamma\", \"reducedPhotonPfCandMap\" map is used for the footprint removal. For puppi weight is taken from the map produced by PuppiProducer that should be available during miniAOD. \n- particleBasedIsolation is configurable now in CITK.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 411, "closed_at": "1476190505", "comments": 75, "commits": 196, "created_at": "1475247972", "deletions": 21318, "labels": ["alca-pending", "analysis-pending", "comparison-pending", "core-pending", "db-pending", "dqm-pending", "fastsim-pending", "generators-pending", "geometry-pending", "hlt-pending", "l1-pending", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-rejected", "tests-pending", "visualization-pending"], "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 16055, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 20, "state": "closed", "title": "Puppi isolation miniAOD electrons & photons", "updated_at": "1476190505", "user": "ishvetso"}

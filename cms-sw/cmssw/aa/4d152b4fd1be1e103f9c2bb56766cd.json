The content of this new skim is stored in MiniAOD. After testing on ~5000 minbias events from 2024 PbPb data, the size of the old skims (PbPbEMu + PbPbZEE + PbPbZMu) is about 3% of 2024 RawPrime PDs while the new EW skim is only 1%, reducing the skim PD size by a factor of 3 in 2025 PbPb while enhancing the physics potential (looser selection). The relval 143.203 is added to test the new skim.\r\n\r\n@flodamas @mandrenguyen \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested with relval 143.203\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

It is not appropriate for Phase-2 simulation and leads to storing too many low weight neutral pileup particles in high-pT jets, particularly in the endcap.\r\n\r\nWhile this change is too late for production, it would be useful to validate this change as an analysis recipe.\r\n\r\nOne round of jenkins tests including upgrade workflows would be useful.

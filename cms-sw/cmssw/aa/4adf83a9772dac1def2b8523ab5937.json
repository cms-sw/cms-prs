Over 500 CMSSW macros do not compile in ROOT6. Since that is too many macros to be fixed centrally, it was decided by David Lange to centrally fix only those 45 macros with compilation errors that have been modified since the switch over to git, since those are the ones most likely to be used. Only one of these 45 macros is in the Visualization L2 category. This pull request fixes it, plus other macros in the same package with the same problem.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1429482430", "comments": 6, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1428951428", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "visualization-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "5f729b28d23f49d71f0dbd29359b029ea88af31d", "merged_at": "1429482430", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 8712, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Macros need to compile in ROOT6 (Visualization)", "updated_at": "1431031571", "user": "wmtan"}

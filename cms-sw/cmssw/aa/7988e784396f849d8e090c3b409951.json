This was unfortunately missed during the scrutiny of the PR. Although the test is technical, and most likely these skims will not be reused in any close future, this PR restores them so as to minimize changes to tests and keep PA skims around for memory.\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid interferences with the new PbPb skims, the names of modules and paths are all updated adding the PA label. With this update wf 140.54 runs again.\r\n\r\nWith the occasion, the new skims are added to the 2018 HI data test workflows 140.56 and 140.57, as well as the ALCA step (as in the PPRECO tests on MC).", "branch": "CMSSW_10_3_X", "changed_files": 6, "comments": 8, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1541105903", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["backport-ok", "comparison-available", "operations-approved", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "upgrade-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_3_X", "number": 25095, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Restore PA skims, update HI 2018 data test workflows, backport to 103X", "updated_at": "1541144033", "user": "fabiocos"}

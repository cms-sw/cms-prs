This update was originally designed to make a better agreement between TP energy for the PFA1' scheme and MAHI energy, but recently we found that it also has affected TP energy for the PFA2 scheme(old TP algorithm), by reducing its energy scale by 3~4%.  And because we haven't applied this update in the PCC algorithm for RecHits(Method 0), currently there exists a discrepancy between PFA2 and Method 0, which we don't want. Therefore, this PR applies the update on the PCC algorithm described in PR #34572 also for method 0, by adding a shared configurable parameter switching on the PCC update both in TP and Method 0. The impact of this PR is shown in [this presentation](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1084544/contributions/4559681/attachments/2324926/3959938/Commissioning_1TS_Scheme_21Oct08.pdf).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nA basic technical test was performed: runTheMatrix.py -l limited \r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nThis PR is not a backport.

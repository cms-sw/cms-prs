There were two contributing factors:\r\n1. The producers for the scouting collections were not in the MC HLT menu.\r\n2. The event content definitions did not include the scouting collection names.\r\n\r\nThis PR solves both issues. (Thanks to @dsperka for providing an updated HLT menu with the producers included, from which I extracted only the relevant and necessary configurations and added them to the existing menu.)\r\n\r\nNo content is changed; just new scouting collections are added. Therefore, this should be a viable update for future UL16 MC requests.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nReran private signal production and observed the desired collections with the expected content (jets, etc.).\r\n\r\nattn: @tresreid @cericeci\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1675762058", "comments": 6, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1675453125", "deletions": 7, "labels": ["hlt-rejected", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 40691, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "HLT scouting event content and producers [80X]", "updated_at": "1675762059", "user": "kpedro88"}

In addition, it is useful to view these events in a wider time window than the default configuration. This PR changes the timing windows and removes a chi-square constraint to make DQM more useful during splash events. This is not meant to be merged into CMSSW.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nValidated by the standard DQM configuration. No issues seen.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1634741072", "comments": 10, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1634657192", "deletions": 9, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "number": 35734, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "(Splash only) Special timing plot configuration for splash events", "updated_at": "1634741072", "user": "abhih1"}

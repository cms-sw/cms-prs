It allows for the use of the full dynamic range of the track parameters. Additionally, this PR updates some of the ancillary code used by the GTT developers.\r\n\r\nPorting local https://github.com/cms-l1t-offline/cmssw/pull/1037\r\n\r\n#### PR validation\r\n\r\nThis PR was validated by passing the resulting test vectors through the Xilinx HLS firmware generation stage. We also performed many of the calculations by hand in order to validate that the code was performing the correct operations. Finally, we ran the scram code-checks and code-format commands to make sure the code complied with the CMS code rules.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1664948999", "comments": 14, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1663325960", "deletions": 30, "labels": ["l1-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "upgrade-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "7e399a248d4da4fa3f4d66270190ce864ba76498", "merged_at": "1664948999", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_6_X", "number": 39418, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "[L1T] Update track z0 in the fastHistoEmulation algorithm of VertexFinder", "updated_at": "1664948999", "user": "cecilecaillol"}

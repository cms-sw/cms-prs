A new GT has been prepared by AlCa, and we have slightly edited relval workflow 158.0 to pick up this new GT so testing will still function.\r\n\r\nWe find that the reconstruction timing and event content size go down only very slightly, while we see a massive reduction in fake rate at the cost of a small efficiency loss.  More information on the performance and strategy can be found at [1].\r\n\r\n[1] https://indico.cern.ch/event/754818/contributions/3127986/attachments/1709774/2768010/MVA_PR_Sept13_2018.pdf\r\n\r\n@mandrenguyen", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 13, "comments": 29, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1536872046", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pdmv-approved", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_3_X", "number": 24537, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Update to pp_on_AA_2018 era track selection with new MVAs", "updated_at": "1537376027", "user": "abaty"}

In addition, skeleton code was added to pack/unpack CSCShowerDigi. \r\n\r\nNeither addition modifies the CSC packer/unpacker. \r\n\r\nI also cleaned up the configuration of `cscpacker` in `cscPacker_cfi`. The same definition is already in the C++ module (fillDescriptions) and then again as commented Python code in the same file. I removed the duplicates. So `cscpacker` is now defined as a clone of `cscPackerDef` which is automatically generated by the compiler.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles and runs with WF 11634.0. There should not be any changes in any workflows.\r\n\r\n```\r\n11634.0_TTbar_14TeV+2021+TTbar_14TeV_TuneCP5_GenSim+Digi+Reco+HARVEST+ALCA Step0-PASSED Step1-PASSED Step2-PASSED Step3-PASSED Step4-PASSED  - time date Thu Apr 15 12:32:46 2021-date Thu Apr 15 12:03:53 2021; exit: 0 0 0 0 0\r\n1 1 1 1 1 tests passed, 0 0 0 0 0 failed\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nBefore submitting your pull requests, make sure you followed this checklist:\r\n- verify that the PR is really intended for the chosen branch\r\n- verify that changes follow [CMS Naming, Coding, And Style Rules](http://cms-sw.github.io/cms_coding_rules.html)\r\n- verify that the PR passes the basic test procedure suggested in the [CMSSW PR instructions](https://cms-sw.github.io/PRWorkflow.html)\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 16, "closed_at": "1619588481", "comments": 39, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1618501614", "deletions": 74, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "9f77c3d3de6ff3f086a52237dd58ade156fb2b73", "merged_at": "1619588480", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "number": 33444, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "Load CLCT pre-trigger digis in CSC packer.

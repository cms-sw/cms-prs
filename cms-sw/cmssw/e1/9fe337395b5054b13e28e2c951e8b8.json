If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nNot a backport, to be backported to CMSSW_14_1_X and CMSSW_14_0_X for data-taking operations purposes.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 4, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1725375737", "deletions": 37, "labels": ["db-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved", "trk"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_2_X", "number": 45867, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Add certificates handling to `G2GainsValidator.py`", "updated_at": "1725379249", "user": "mmusich"}

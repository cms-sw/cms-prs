A new class, FWLiteEnabler, replaces AutoLibraryLoader.\nThe AutoLibraryLoader class is kept for now just in case any private user code is using it.\nIn ROOT macros and python scripts, FWLiteEnabler::enable() replaces AutoLibraryLoader::enable()  In C++ code, class FWLiteEnabler is not needed, and the free function fwlite::enable() can be called instead.\nAny remaining use of AutoLibraryLoader:;enable() will work for now, but a warning message will be given.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 164, "closed_at": "1432755189", "comments": 14, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1432749313", "deletions": 310, "labels": ["alca-pending", "analysis-pending", "comparison-pending", "core-pending", "db-pending", "dqm-pending", "fastsim-pending", "generators-pending", "hlt-pending", "l1-pending", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending", "visualization-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 9303, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "Rename AutoLibraryLoader (FWLite), which is misnamed", "updated_at": "1432802611", "user": "wmtan"}

The `edm::ExternalWork` is removed from modules that do not need it and the kernel is modified to be able t run with any number of threads and blocks.\r\nThe PR also adds new matrix workflows for Phase 2 ECAL developments with GPUs (*.612). The existing *.61 workflows remain CPU only.\r\n\r\nNo changes to the output are expected.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nNo changes observed.\r\nTested also with WF 28234.61 by manually adding the gpu modifier to the reconstruction step of the WF.\r\nPasses 32234.61 and the new 32234.612.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1662699542", "comments": 30, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1661436891", "deletions": 88, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "pdmv-approved", "orp-approved", "upgrade-approved", "code-checks-approved", "heterogeneous-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "5a67ff982fd611a27ef75d11b669351e1b686d7c", "merged_at": "1662699542", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_6_X", "number": 39195, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "ECAL - Implement follow up issues for Phase 2 GPU reconstruction", "updated_at": "1662699542", "user": "thomreis"}

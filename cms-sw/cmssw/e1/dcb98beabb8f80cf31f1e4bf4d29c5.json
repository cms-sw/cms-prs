Same goes for begin/end lumi, but they are less common. I allow `dqmBeginRun`, since it logically makes sense and is also mostly save (It's hard to do anything illegal with DQM objects before `bookHistograms`).\r\n\r\nThe full API is still available in `DQMOneEDAnalyzer`, and the few modules having non-trivial `endRun` today where migrated to it. However, the majority was just debug printouts, which I simply removed.\r\n\r\nThis is separate PR (separate form the coming bigger changes, PR #28622 ), to make the changes affecting subsystem code more visible and allow a validation independent from the coming bigger PR.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCompiles, and no changes to *file* output are expected.  There will be less log output in some configurations.\r\n\r\nSome \"summary\" printouts where removed; these might be useful, but should not be part of DQM modules.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 154, "closed_at": "1578558839", "comments": 42, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1575478665", "deletions": 442, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "generators-pending", "hlt-approved", "l1-pending", "orp-approved", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved", "xpog-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "1f5425d0a21a6b3b77062a91274730edf0855e44", "merged_at": "1578558839", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 28552, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "DQM: Remove dqmEndRun in DQMEDAnalyzer", "updated_at": "1578558839", "user": "schneiml"}

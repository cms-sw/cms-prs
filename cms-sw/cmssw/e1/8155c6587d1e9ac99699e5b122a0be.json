This separate process is controlled by ExternalGeneratorFilter and cooperatively shares the CPU with cmsRun.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nAdditional unit tests were added to compare the output of Pythia8GeneratorFilter run directly within cmsRun and run via the ExternalGeneratorFilter. With just 1 stream/thread the output is identical. With multiple streams, the GenLumiInfoHeader, edm::HepMCProduct, GenEventInfoProduct and the GenRunInfoProduct are identical. The GenLumiInfoProduct is nearly identical exception the XSec value and errors are different.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 34, "closed_at": "1587451476", "comments": 56, "commits": 14, "created_at": "1586471539", "deletions": 87, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "generators-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "8869156d5090e24074cf0d6c00f7dca9296ba925", "merged_at": "1587451476", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 29445, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 5, "state": "closed", "title": "Run GeneratorFilter modules in an external process controlled by cmsRun", "updated_at": "1587451477", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

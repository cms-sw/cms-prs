Fix to https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/37791.\r\nFollowing the discussion in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/38025#discussion_r878162570, this PR uses `copy` to avoid propagating changes done in Repack.py back to the RawEventContent object\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nUsed [RunRepack.py](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/Configuration/DataProcessing/test/RunRepack.py) to generate a test configuration. The resulting PSet had the required output module attributes and the repack job was executed correctly using cmsRun. The produced RAW file included the expected products.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\nThis is a backport of #38049. Needed to avoid dropping necessary products from T0 RAW files.\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1655467907", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["operations-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 38408, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[12_4_X] Copies RawEventContent compression settings for Repack jobs", "updated_at": "1655467932", "user": "germanfgv"}

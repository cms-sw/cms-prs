The new DQM GUI has been designed to host also DQM root legacy files with single LS granularity, which in the end would need to be produced from this new nanoDQMIO datasets.\r\n\r\nMore info in the evolving twiki: https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/PerLsDQMIO#nanoDQMIO_data_Tier\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCurrently being tested with all the runTheMatrix flavours and in discussion with O&C", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1625035976", "comments": 10, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1624430115", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "05226f47afccf67f1b6207aa29e13ad85e3f9df2", "merged_at": "1625035976", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "number": 34220, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "RFC: [DQM] First prototype of nanoDQMIO with single LS granularity", "updated_at": "1625035977", "user": "jfernan2"}

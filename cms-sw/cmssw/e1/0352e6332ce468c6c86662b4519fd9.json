Call tool with `--mergeOfflineParallel`-flag to activate the feature.\r\n\r\n-`statistical measures`: Several statistical measures of potential interest are printed out for each DMR validation. Includes several p-Values to judge the significance of differences between the distributions and an estimate for the alignment uncertainty.\r\n\r\nFurther details can be found at:\r\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/649310/contributions/2673094/attachments/1502539/2340536/presentation.pdf\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1503425033", "comments": 11, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1502269854", "deletions": 30, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "dbd8653f98656d364a0000b5d4134ebd48491af1", "merged_at": "1503425033", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_3_X", "number": 20094, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "additional features for alignment validation dmr plotting tool", "updated_at": "1503425033", "user": "ssthr"}

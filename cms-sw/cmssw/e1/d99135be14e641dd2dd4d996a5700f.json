The resolution is measured separately for the first vertex in the given collection (a clone of `goodOfflinePrimaryVertices` by default) and for the other vertices. Plots include resolutions and pulls of x, y, and z coordinates as\r\n- inclusive distribution\r\n- vs. number of tracks\r\n- vs. sum(pT)\r\n- vs. number of vertices (in the same collection)\r\n- vs. instantaneous luminosity (from `LumiScalers`)\r\n\r\nThe splitting method uses random numbers to assign the input vertex tracks to two sets. In order to have reproducible results the random number generator is seeded by a combination of event, lumi, and run numbers (anyway the event number is already assigned randomly-enough wrt. the physics content of the event).\r\n\r\nTested in 9_3_0_pre3, expecting new histograms and no changes in existing histograms.\r\n\r\n@rovere @VinInn @sarafiorendi @rmanzoni @mtosi ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1505195176", "comments": 25, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1504506758", "deletions": 13, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "e9432dc90cb37347a79f0564a669fca7585ac1e1", "merged_at": "1505195176", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_4_X", "number": 20362, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add primary vertex resolution to tracking DQM", "updated_at": "1505195176", "user": "makortel"}

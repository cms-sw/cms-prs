The seed is based on the event run/lumi/event numbers and the chi2 value of the first track. (The last quantity is added to ensure different seeding when the producer is called with different collections. Currently two versions of it exist in the Phase2 reco sequences, one for general tracks and another for GSF electron tracks.)\r\n\r\nI checked the `t()` value of the 4D vertices after running 20034.2 with step3 on 1 thread vs 4 threads. In the default release, I see a change; with this PR, there is no change.\r\n\r\nShould this be backported to 93X? It runs in RECO, while with 93X we only plan to do re-miniAOD.\r\n\r\nattn: @lgray, @bendavid ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1511596236", "comments": 45, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1510930690", "deletions": 35, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "31ef92c7d105bd4baa7d05a5ee6dac209a08a8d3", "merged_at": "1511596236", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_0_X", "number": 21354, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "use deterministic seed for time smearing producers", "updated_at": "1511596236", "user": "kpedro88"}

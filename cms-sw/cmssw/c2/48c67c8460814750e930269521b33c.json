The related ESProducer is also added. The logic of the ESProducer (to choose which one of the two possible online beamspot records to be propagated to the HLT reconstruction) may change in the future but this would not affect the data formats of the records.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nI have run a private test to check the consistency of the code. \r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 186, "closed_at": "1594183708", "comments": 3, "commits": 34, "created_at": "1594183438", "deletions": 17721, "labels": ["alca-pending", "code-checks-pending", "comparison-pending", "db-pending", "dqm-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 30587, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "BS online code for HLT menu: introducing a transientRecord and the related ESProducer", "updated_at": "1594183737", "user": "gennai"}

This PR includes the last 2 Core packages. These are the only Core packages where clang format was not already run and the results already in a merged or pending PR. The one exception is the Skeletons package, where there is in an issue to remind us of the problems that need to be resolved.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe only test I performed was checking that the revised packages compile and build.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1558420342", "comments": 16, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1558011392", "deletions": 362, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "05cc4e18a93c1b6741da6fc75848d5fe7e50888b", "merged_at": "1558420342", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 26807, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Changes from scram build code-format-all", "updated_at": "1558420342", "user": "wddgit"}

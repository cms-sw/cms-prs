In the latter, the update of the `egmGsfElectronIDsForDQM` module to include (via VID) only new Run3 electron IDs had created issues to non-EGM DQM, such as TOP, B2G and ParticleNet. In order to address this, the current PR updates the electron IDs used by non-EGM DQM too. Other POGs and PAGs have been informed and have followed up on [CMSHLT-2876](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSHLT-2876).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nrunTheMatrix.py -l 12434.0\r\n\r\nThis did not show the issues that were there in #42049, #42216, #42217, where for example the TopMonitoring was unable to get a handle of the electron ID.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 10, "comments": 5, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1689674692", "deletions": 15, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved", "egamma"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_3_X", "number": 42294, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Update electron IDs in OfflineDQM", "updated_at": "1689677167", "user": "RSalvatico"}

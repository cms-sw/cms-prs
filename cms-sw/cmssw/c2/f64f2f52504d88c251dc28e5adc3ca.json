Would that be compatible with naming and code rules?\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles, matrix tests run without errors.\r\n\r\nCC: @robervalwalsh @mdelcourt @mmusich @tsusa ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 70, "closed_at": "1625356501", "comments": 14, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1625039370", "deletions": 586, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "db-approved", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "2dd764fdd357f16539e9101a9282541d421b1462", "merged_at": "1625356501", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "number": 34285, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "SiStripDetInfoFileReader refactoring and cleanup", "updated_at": "1625356501", "user": "pieterdavid"}

Add new plots.\n   - strip_phi_dist plots on every chamber are added.\n     - These plots can be used to acquire strip's global phi degrees from GEMGeometry.\n   - strip_dphi plots for each station are added.\n     - These plots include difference between first and last strips from GEMGeometry.\n     - It can be used to compare chamber's (designed) phi angle.\n   - strip_phiz plots on every chamber are added.\n     - These plots has strip digi hit's occupancy plots on chamber.\n     - So, it can be used to check of layer's changes.\n2. Add configuration for plots.\n   - Add configuration to handle global XY plots binning.(by python)\n   - Add configuration to change strip_phiz plot's x-axis starting point(-5 degrees) and step(10 degrees).\n     - egs) first plot has -5~5 degrees. second plot has 5~15 degrees of x-axis[phi].\n3. Bugfix\n   - When the gem hits did not matched any GEM detector, it will fail call GeomDet.(When use different version CMSSW.)\n     - Skip functions are added. To warning, its error is displayed using std::cout.\n4. Macro files\n   - Add MakePlot.py to draw looking good plots easily.\n   - Add Compare.py which generates plots to compare between different geometries.\n5. Migration.\n   - To migration 7X, GetByLabel is changed to GetByToken and consume.( obligation of 7X version )\n   - Validation modules were modified.\n   - Matcher class will be apply later due to refactoring.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "changed_files": 37, "closed_at": "1405504665", "comments": 5, "commits": 38, "created_at": "1405369770", "deletions": 692, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "new-package-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "7169368103a1efbd62147b4221b4118e974091f7", "merged_at": "1405504665", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "number": 4645, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "Update Plots, fix bugs and migration preparation.", "updated_at": "1405504665", "user": "geonmo"}

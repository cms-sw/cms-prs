This is not really legal, since `DQMEventInfo` is a `DQMEDAnalyzer` and not supposed to run in harvesting. \r\n\r\nWhile this worked by coincidence in the past, in #28622 such modules' output is no longer written to file. To fix this, I added a new module that is based on `DQMEDHarvester` which only records the values which make sense in harvesting.\r\n\r\nOn request of @mmusich , who wanted to have this functionality preserved for AlCa harvesting jobs.\r\n\r\nI changed a few configurations where it is rather obvious that `DQMEventInfo` was used in harvesting, however, that list might be not complete.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRuns wf 1001, where the issue was spotted. Some configuration files changed here might not be tested in the PR tests.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 10, "closed_at": "1580496685", "comments": 43, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1580311426", "deletions": 111, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "5ecb68ab680c32ccd3c58cf3f8046d4dab98411d", "merged_at": "1580496685", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 28821, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "DQM: New EventInfo module for Harvesting", "updated_at": "1580496686", "user": "schneiml"}

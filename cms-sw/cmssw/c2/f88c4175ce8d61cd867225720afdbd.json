This allows for a more detailed analysis of the Patatrack pixel tracking performance by providing additional simulation truth for more intermediate objects in Patatrack. This includes triplets and N-tuplets and their respective cuts applied when built in reconstruction.\r\n\r\nThis PR is currently a draft and not ready for review. More detailed information will follow...\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTo be added...\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

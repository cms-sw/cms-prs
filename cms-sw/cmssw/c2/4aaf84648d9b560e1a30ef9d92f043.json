This was causing compile time warnings about mismatched enum types.  This fixes the warnings but likely the logic error is still present.  The GT experts have been notified to investigate and provide a future fix, but this is not needed for 80x.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1455611925", "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1455610504", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-pending", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "ef40d84e3d740a625e80aa2e9b74c9c36255d719", "merged_at": "1455611925", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 13296, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "quiet compile time warnings from Gt Energy Sum correlation condition", "updated_at": "1455804237", "user": "mulhearn"}

More specifically it demonstrates a case where one `PortableCollection` member holds an index to an element of the other `PortableCollection`, and this indirection is hidden as an implementation detail for the user of the EventSetup data product (this is more or less the case that @kakwok has with one of the HCAL EventSetup data products).\r\n\r\nIn addition, the `TestAlgo.dev.cc` is updated to use the `once_per_grid()` helper.\r\n\r\nResolves https://github.com/makortel/framework/issues/721\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nUnit tests run on CPU and on GPU.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 13, "comments": 3, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1704817438", "deletions": 13, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "heterogeneous-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "number": 43682, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Example of Alpaka-based EventSetup data product that uses PortableCollection member variables", "updated_at": "1704817818", "user": "makortel"}

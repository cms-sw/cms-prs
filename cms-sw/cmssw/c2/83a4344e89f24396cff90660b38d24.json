As this is affecting the classification of hits, at present adopted only by MTD for Phase2 simulation, a ```LogError``` is added in ```MtdSD``` for hits associated to tracks with such an id.\r\n\r\nThis is not meant to be a long-term solution, but a fast workaround to allow the production blocked by this issue. This is the first problem reported in 2.5 years during which this mechanism has been in place. Alternative long term solutions can be discussed with more calm after this patch is back-ported to releases used in production.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles and runs (wf. 34434.0).", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1768320134", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["simulation-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-rejected", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_1_X", "number": 49801, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Simulation: prevent exception if trackId larger than 200M", "updated_at": "1768336250", "user": "fabiocos"}

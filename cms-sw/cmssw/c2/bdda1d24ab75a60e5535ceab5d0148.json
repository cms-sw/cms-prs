I realized this is because the \"manual\" zero suppression was set in `SimCalorimetry/HcalZeroSuppressionProducers/python/hcalDigisRealistic_cfi.py` only for phase 2. The ability to set ZS values in that config is useful e.g for making unsuppressed samples. However, for upgrade scenarios it is more consistent to get the ZS values from the hardcode conditions (where most other condition values are already obtained).\r\n\r\nThis PR implements that. Also, for the upgraded HB the level is set to 3, same as the upgraded HE (should have been done a while ago, but was overlooked).", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": "1513710051", "comments": 27, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1513264924", "deletions": 55, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "61370c1075710f86befa74556bab9b729826f1a3", "merged_at": "1513710051", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_0_X", "number": 21719, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 5, "state": "closed", "title": "Get ZS values from hardcode conditions", "updated_at": "1513710052", "user": "kpedro88"}

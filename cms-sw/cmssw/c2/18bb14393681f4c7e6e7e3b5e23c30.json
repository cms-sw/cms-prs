Using the hits will likely produce code crashes or simply bogus results. This PR simply removes the hits from entering the EMTF emulator. This is a temporary solution.\r\n\r\nFurther discussion can be found on the issue above (#21201). \r\n\r\n@abrinke1 , @kpedro88 please check/comment, thanks!", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1510764861", "comments": 12, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1510072862", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "l1-pending", "orp-approved", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "56d188be0a1d64f83df0f324cbed60fb69c82a77", "merged_at": "1510764861", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_0_X", "number": 21203, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix L1TMuonEndCap warning regarding Phase 2 iRPC hits", "updated_at": "1510764861", "user": "jiafulow"}

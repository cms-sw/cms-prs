DQMRootOutputModule is the last module using consumesMany in CMSSW outside of Core unit tests and finishing the consumesMany migration was the initial motivation for this work. Even without that motivation, it is a good thing that output modules now support GetterOfProducts in the same way as producers, filter and analyzers.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis includes a new unit test using GetterOfProducts to read products in a one, a limited and a global output module.\r\n ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 13, "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1682690319", "deletions": 50, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "core-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_1_X", "number": 41460, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 6, "state": "open", "title": "GetterOfProducts for output modules, use in DQMRootOutputModule", "updated_at": "1682946416", "user": "wddgit"}

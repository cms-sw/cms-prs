Even without that motivation, it is a good thing that output modules now support GetterOfProducts in the same way as producers, filter and analyzers.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis includes a new unit test using GetterOfProducts to read products in a one, a limited and a global output module.\r\n ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 13, "closed_at": "1683310657", "comments": 19, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1682690319", "deletions": 50, "labels": ["core-approved", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "25acc7a3832fa981722baf8d5c8adb90b680ecb8", "merged_at": "1683310657", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_13_2_X", "number": 41460, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 6, "state": "closed", "title": "GetterOfProducts for output modules, use in DQMRootOutputModule", "updated_at": "1683310657", "user": "wddgit"}

An analyzer is added to Validation/RecoMuon/src, very similar to the one for standard muons. Also the necessary configuration files are added, and the sequences included in the global configuration.\r\nValidation for standard muon collection is left unchanged.\r\n\r\nSee presentation on MUO POG General meeting: https://indico.cern.ch/event/1389920/#2-displaced-muon-in-the-valida\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nSame validation as in PR #44353. Basic tests (`scram b runtests`) have been run aswell.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nThis is a backport of PR #44353 to release 14_0_X.

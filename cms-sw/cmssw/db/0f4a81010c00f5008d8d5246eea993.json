This was reported at [Tracking POG on October 7, 2024](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1461703/#53-mkfit-status-update). Changes for Run-3 are anyway negligible.\r\n\r\nFor phase-2 mkFit, this PR:\r\n- introduces propagation to plane and Kalman operations on plane during pattern recognition;\r\n- introduces support for scalar operations and VDT in Matriplex.\r\n\r\nPropagation to plane is used as a mkFit-default choice for phase-2 (where mkFit is not deployed yet), being required to select hits on tilted layers, while phase-1 configuration is left unchanged (no significant gain wrt. current default).\r\n\r\nIn addition, standalone mkFit functionalities are also extended/improved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### PR validation:\r\n\r\nPlease, refer to presentation at [Tracking POG on October 7, 2024](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1461703/#53-mkfit-status-update) (including MTV results).\r\n\r\n--> For phase-1 (Run-3), (only physics) performance is only slightly affected, due to a small bug-fix in application of material effects (commit 4a6088d7de22e4f63284527a6556b1b97659b6d0).\r\n\r\n--> For phase-2, mkFit physics performance (mkFit is not used by default so far) is largely improved.\r\n\r\nFYI: @kskovpen", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 71, "comments": 20, "commits": 31, "created_at": "1728485672", "deletions": 1973, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved", "tracking"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_2_X", "number": 46325, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 4, "state": "open", "title": "Phase-2 mkFit: propagation to plane / Kalman operations on plane / Matriplex with support for scalar operations and VDT", "updated_at": "1728650481", "user": "mmasciov"}

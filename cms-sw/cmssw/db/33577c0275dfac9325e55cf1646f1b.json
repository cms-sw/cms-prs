This is dependent on cms-dist PR for the new model (https://github.com/cms-sw/cmsdist/pull/9741, https://github.com/cms-sw/cmsdist/pull/9744) and assumes integration of v5 into the next menu. \r\nA JIRA ticket for the menu changes and new model thresholds is planned imminently. \r\n\r\nThe code has 2 main changes:\r\n\r\n- the eta and phi of muon objects has been modified slightly to better match firmware implementation (ie hwEta->hwEtaAtVtx)\r\n- the model types have been updated for v5\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis code has been validated with the new model version and all standard code checks have been performed. \r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_15_0_X", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 13, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1741666412", "deletions": 11, "labels": ["l1-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "requires-external"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_0_X", "number": 47552, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 6, "state": "open", "title": "Changes to prepare for AXOL1TL v5 (15_0_X)", "updated_at": "1741977462", "user": "quinnanm"}

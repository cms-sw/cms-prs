Note, the method is still accessible, but will be cleaned up in a later PR. \r\n* Instead of `mergeSpecifics()`, now `DDFilteredView` can be constructed from a `DDCompactView` and a `DDFilter`:\r\n```c++\r\n  const cms::DDFilter filter(\"OnlyForHcalSimNumbering\", \"HCAL\");\r\n  cms::DDFilteredView fv(cpv, filter);\r\n```\r\n* Use `regexp` as `keys` in a `Filter` to speed it up a bit\r\n* <strike>Add a print filter method to allow easier debugging</strike>\r\n* Remove methods that are not needed any more\r\n* Use Hcal parameters builder as a user story study\r\n\r\n@bsunanda - you may want to remove the `BenchmarkGrd` and disable the `MessageLogger` for the `Geometry`.\r\n\r\nIt's slightly slower to merge the filter registry:\r\n```\r\n< Benchmark 'DTGeometryESProducer Filter Registry' took 0.057576 millis\r\n---\r\n> Benchmark 'DTGeometryESProducer Filter Registry' took 0.052404 millis\r\n```\r\nbut, it's ~8% faster to build the DT geometry:\r\n```\r\n< Benchmark 'DTGeometryESProducer' took 8082.02 millis\r\n---\r\n> Benchmark 'DTGeometryESProducer' took 8713.86 millis\r\n``` \r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with a description of the feature proposed or problem addressed, specifying:\r\n  - what changes are expected in the output if any, \r\n  - what other PRs or externals it depends upon if any,\r\n  - link to any additional material useful to provide a documentation for this PR (slides, JIRA tickets, related pull requestes, hypernews, TWiki or Indico pages)  -->\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with a description of which tests have been performed to verify the correctness of the PR, including the eventual addition of new code for testing like unit tests, test configurations, additions or updates to the runTheMatrix test workflows -->\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with any link to  -->\r\n\r\nBefore submitting your pull requests, make sure you followed this checklist:\r\n- verify that the PR is really intended for the chosen branch\r\n- verify that changes follow [CMS Naming, Coding, And Style Rules](http://cms-sw.github.io/cms_coding_rules.html)\r\n- verify that the PR passes the basic test procedure suggested in the [CMSSW PR instructions](https://cms-sw.github.io/PRWorkflow.html)\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 22, "closed_at": "1584518477", "comments": 28, "commits": 8, "created_at": "1584290496", "deletions": 338, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "cab9f3b216ef59d0fba83c5cba93876ddae55d35", "merged_at": "1584518477", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 29208, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "[DD4hep] DD Filtered View: Add Debug Print, RegExp Speed Up and Clean Up", "updated_at": "1584518477", "user": "ianna"}

At the moment, it's quite messy (spanning 540 lines). I would like to put all PSets for ALCT, CLCT, TMB, MPC and CCLUT in \r\n```\r\npython/\r\n* alctParams_cfi\r\n* clctParams_cfi\r\n* tmbParams_cfi\r\n* auxiliaryParams_cfi\r\n* cclutParams_cfi\r\n```\r\nrather than directly in `cscTriggerPrimitiveDigis_cfi`, reducing it to less than 100 lines. \r\n\r\nI'm not satisfied yet with the proposal. For instance, [this section](https://github.com/dildick/cmssw/blob/23e7af8087a5ca460b7b32675dfec5f869757b62/L1Trigger/CSCTriggerPrimitives/src/CSCBaseboard.cc#L42-L79), in CSCBaseboard is too complicated, and it does not even include the cases when the CCLUT algorithm is switched on... I think I would need an extra layer in python with a bunch of functions that do this customization, rather than hard-code them in CSCBaseboard. If someone knows a way in python to configure the ALCTs, CLCTs and TMBs for each scenario depending on the master switches, let me know.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nNot yet validated.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n@tahuang1991 ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 8, "closed_at": "1599761493", "comments": 12, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1599615557", "deletions": 523, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-notrun", "l1-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-rejected", "upgrade-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 31401, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 4, "state": "closed", "title": "Clean-up CSC trigger configuration for Run-3 and Phase-2", "updated_at": "1599761494", "user": "dildick"}

Apart from the configurations discussed above, only the following configurations remain for Phase 2 HLT:\r\n- `trackingLST`: single iteration, CA-extended Patatrack, LST for building.\r\n- `trackingMkFitFit`: single iteration, CA-extended Patatrack + LST for seeding, mkFit for building, mkFit (instead of CKF) fitting.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the above, the workflows of intermediate configurations have been removed. Together with that, the updates of #49755 (and this PR is superseded by this one) have been included here, to avoid conflicts.\r\n\r\nThe NGT scouting configurations have been touched as apart of the aforementioned simplifications but all of the previous configurations are still supported.\r\n\r\nThe PR has been validated by running all the supported configuration and making sure that they produce exactly the same results as before the changes, i.e. this PR is purely technical for those configurations:\r\n<details><summary>Current baseline (click me for validation plot)</summary>\r\n<img width=\"1321\" height=\"889\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0ffdb40-392e-43b9-9c49-14e35f815ce8\" />\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Current baseline but with legacy (instead of Patatrack) quads (click me for validation plot)</summary>\r\n<img width=\"1321\" height=\"889\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dfaf94bf-2762-487d-a23d-58bc4f089ec6\" />\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details><summary>New baseline (click me for validation plot)</summary>\r\n<img width=\"1321\" height=\"889\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f2b1099-8b98-4b84-bcde-35ec3939c258\" />\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details><summary>`trackingLST` (click me for validation plot)</summary>\r\n<img width=\"1321\" height=\"889\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f25e7fc-40a6-4a80-a1d7-521bb297f7dc\" />\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details><summary>`trackingMkFitFit` (click me for validation plot)</summary>\r\n<img width=\"1321\" height=\"889\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8aba902d-d0ad-4b80-91f3-1a34865f5c34\" />\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details><summary>`ngtScouting` (click me for validation plot)</summary>\r\n<img width=\"1321\" height=\"889\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c64675e-62e1-4812-8c82-9f5a6e36ddf1\" />\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details><summary>`ngtScouting,trackingLST` (click me for validation plot)</summary>\r\n<img width=\"1321\" height=\"889\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3bfdcda-5ca6-46e2-a49c-1af800eec122\" />\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nFYI @rovere ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 44, "comments": 64, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1770280104", "deletions": 717, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "hlt-pending", "operations-approved", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "code-checks-approved", "tracking", "trk"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_1_X", "number": 50040, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 24, "state": "open", "title": "Switch to the new tracking baseline (single iteration, CA-extended Patatrack + LST, mkFit) as Phase 2 HLT default", "updated_at": "1770920606", "user": "VourMa"}

It extends VecArray accordingly, in particular, adds a small set of operators/helpers (e.g., element-wise ops, dot, axpy, norms) with constexpr  device-compatible implementations and keeps existing VecArray APIs intact.  This functionality is required for Alpaka electron seeding algorithm implementation (currently WIP). \r\nresolves https://github.com/cms-sw/framework-team/issues/1516#issue-3304464621\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 10, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1755008085", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "heterogeneous-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 48727, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 26, "state": "open", "title": "Alpaka math vector", "updated_at": "1755261928", "user": "alexstrel"}

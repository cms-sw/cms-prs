See [here](https://cms-talk.web.cern.ch/t/request-for-new-run3-hi-mc-gt-realistic-bs-for-12-5-x/21522/5)\r\n- The GT change includes the tag `BeamSpotObjects_Realistic2022PbPbCollision_v5_mc` as can be seen in the diffs:\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/131X_mcRun3_2022_realistic_HI_v1/131X_mcRun3_2022_realistic_HI_v2\r\nand\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/131X_mcRun3_2023_realistic_HI_v1/131X_mcRun3_2023_realistic_HI_v2\r\n\r\n- Relval wfs (322-324, 161.01) that use an input dataset are also added but commented out until input samples can be produced\r\n- For 2022 workflows, cleaned up outdated nomenclature by fully changing `2021` to `2022`\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nwfs 160.0, 160.02, 160.03, 160.1, 160.2, 160.3 were tested with the option -j0.  The cmsDriver commands run successfully, but the cmsRun commands are left for the jenkins tests.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

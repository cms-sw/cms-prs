It needs the record LHCInfoRcd and CTPPSOpticsRcd, which are in process of being integrated into the GT\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nAll standard test has been done: scram b runtests, scram b code-checks and scram b code-formats\r\n\r\nThe runTheMatrix  -l limited -i all --ibeos ran without any error with the official GT, but in this case, since the record below is not in any official GT, an ESSource has been provided on config. \r\n\r\nThen the essource was removed and runTheMatrix was tested with the GT 113X_mcRun3_2021_realistic_Candidate_2021_04_06_19_59_53 with no error, however, the correct GT should be 113X_mcRun3_2021_realistic_Candidate_2021_04_09_15_03_03 (14TeV scenario), in which case, there was some wf that failed, however, the wf that runs PPS works fine (the GT above was proposed to solve the problem of #33266 )\r\n\r\nIn summary: this PR needs the GT 113X_mcRun3_2021_realistic_Candidate_2021_04_09_15_03_03 to be integrated.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 9, "closed_at": "1618985532", "comments": 20, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1618183779", "deletions": 120, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "8385c0cb1136379efc6bba5bb6ef3a6c37e85d0c", "merged_at": "1618985532", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "number": 33405, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Changing the proton propagator to the Optical Function method", "updated_at": "1618985532", "user": "mundim"}

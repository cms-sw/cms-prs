This causes problems with the `find()` function of the `edm::DataFrameContainer`, which only works for sorted detector IDs.\r\nSorting the collections produced by `EcalCPUDigisProducer` fixes this.\r\n\r\nThis also adds some code simplifications to `HLTEcalPhiSymFilter`, which is the module for which the issue manifested itself first.\r\n\r\nAddresses https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSHLT-2335\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe digis collection stored by `hltEcalPhiSymFilter` matches between CPU and GPU machines after sorting the collections.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with any link to  -->\r\n\r\nBackport of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/38321 needed for ECAL calibrations", "branch": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 5, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1654874135", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "hlt-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "backport"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 38323, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "ECAL - Sort digis collections coming from GPU unpacking - 124x", "updated_at": "1654889966", "user": "thomreis"}

This causes problems with the `find()` function of the `edm::DataFrameContainer`, which only works for sorted detector IDs.\r\nSorting the collections produced by `EcalCPUDigisProducer` fixes this.\r\n\r\nThis also adds some code simplifications to `HLTEcalPhiSymFilter`, which is the module for which the issue manifested itself first.\r\n\r\nAddresses https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSHLT-2335\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe digis collection stored by `hltEcalPhiSymFilter` matches between CPU and GPU machines after sorting the collections.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with any link to  -->\r\n\r\nBackport of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/38321 needed for ECAL calibrations", "branch": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1655186279", "comments": 13, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1654874135", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["hlt-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "urgent", "backport-ok"], "merge_commit_sha": "72365c18876637c87c68e5b0db71554db1329cb7", "merged_at": "1655186279", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 38323, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "ECAL - Sort digis collections coming from GPU unpacking - 124x", "updated_at": "1655186279", "user": "thomreis"}

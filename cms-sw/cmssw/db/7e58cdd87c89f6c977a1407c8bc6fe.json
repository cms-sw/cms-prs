The GEM only outputs bunch crossing information, and from what I've been told there's no plan to include timing, so I think this info is unused and not planned to be used in the future. Let me know if you prefer to reverse these changes.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with a description of the feature proposed or problem addressed, specifying:\r\n  - what changes are expected in the output if any, \r\n  - what other PRs or externals it depends upon if any,\r\n  - link to any additional material useful to provide a documentation for this PR (slides, JIRA tickets, related pull requestes, hypernews, TWiki or Indico pages)  -->\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI checked runTheMatrix 24821.0 (TenMuE) with the GE0Geometry in Geometry/GEMGeometry up to DIGI + GEM RecoHit/Segment reconstruction. Segments look to be made correctly, all stations (including GE0) are producing them with the current setup.\r\nI also checked the GE0SegAlgRU produces segments, but we should compare the ME0Segments and GE0Segments produced later, once the whole pipeline is working.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with a description of which tests have been performed to verify the correctness of the PR, including the eventual addition of new code for testing like unit tests, test configurations, additions or updates to the runTheMatrix test workflows -->\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with any link to  -->\r\n\r\nBefore submitting your pull requests, make sure you followed this checklist:\r\n- verify that the PR is really intended for the chosen branch\r\n- verify that changes follow [CMS Naming, Coding, And Style Rules](http://cms-sw.github.io/cms_coding_rules.html)\r\n- verify that the PR passes the basic test procedure suggested in the [CMSSW PR instructions](https://cms-sw.github.io/PRWorkflow.html)\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 10, "closed_at": "1601011561", "comments": 70, "commits": 13, "created_at": "1600240238", "deletions": 23, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "df16751c6c0b37335ae3e39b4975434c5e8e9bba", "merged_at": "1601011561", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 31480, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 39, "state": "closed", "title": "Changes to improve GE0  GEMSegments", "updated_at": "1601011561", "user": "watson-ij"}

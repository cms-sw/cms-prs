Since the package was originally intended to be used in PF, he suggested to take a look at it in the scope of the recent PF cleanup.\r\n\r\nSo here we go: according to indico [1] the package was part of a project to improve tracking in PF by finding the vertices of nuclear interactions and refitting the tracks. However, it seems abandoned as there were no non-technical changes since 2008 [2] and the person responsible for that project (Roberfroid Vincent) apparently left CMS in 2008.\r\n\r\nThe 3 config files in RecoParticleFlow that were referring to NuclearInteractionProducer are also orphans, so they can be safely removed.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, this package is indeed a good candidate for the cleanup.\r\n\r\n@hatakeyamak @bendavid\r\n\r\n[1] https://indico.cern.ch/event/32195/contributions/746713/attachments/622247/856187/vincent.pdf#search=nuclearinteractionproducer\r\n[2] https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/commits/master/RecoVertex/NuclearInteractionProducer\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCMSSW compiles and local matrix tests pass.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\n\r\nNo backport intended.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 16, "closed_at": "1561486910", "comments": 14, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1560802871", "deletions": 862, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "17e8ebbeaa08293a137a81f9632d6ef214786232", "merged_at": "1561486910", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27230, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Remove RecoVertex/NuclearInteractionProducer package", "updated_at": "1561486911", "user": "guitargeek"}

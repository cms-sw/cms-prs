In this particular case, it also avoids the use of `.icc` files that not everyone is familiar with and that are often not syntax-highlighted correctly.\r\n\r\nThe changes made in this PR are only copy-paste and sorting includes to make the review easy.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCMSSW compiles.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nNo backport intended.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1634387288", "deletions": 93, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "number": 35703, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Merge .h files with .icc files in `TrackingTools/GsfTools/plugins`", "updated_at": "1634425236", "user": "guitargeek"}

It is the adaptation of the Alpaka-based `PFRecHitSoAProducer` and `PFClusterSoAProducer` to read Hcal thresholds from GT similar to #43025. Included are some fixes to naming conventions that were missed in the initial implementation of #43130.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nPR was validated using local testing of cluster-level comparison and PF Jet Response comparison as in #43130. The results are consistent between Alpaka and Legacy for the entire variety of configurations: Alpaka CPU and GPU backends with `usePFThresholdsFromDB` set to `true` or `false`.\r\n\r\nThe basic suite of tests, `runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos`, has also been passed.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nPR is not a backport.\r\n\r\n@hatakeyamak @swagata87 \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 17, "comments": 6, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1702586181", "deletions": 87, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "heterogeneous-pending", "pf"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "number": 43574, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Adapt Alpaka-based PF Clustering to read Hcal thresholds from GT", "updated_at": "1702638099", "user": "jsamudio"}

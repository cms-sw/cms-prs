This could occur, for example, if the input jet and PF-candidate collections fed to the producer are inconsistent (and the constituents of the input jets are not available anymore).\r\n\r\nThis type of crash was observed in a recent IB build (see [this comment](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/35863#issuecomment-953519150)); the underlying misconfiguration related to that crash is to be fixed in `ConfDB`, and is under investigation.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nPrivate tests.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nN/A", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1635591895", "comments": 17, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1635436472", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["hlt-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "requires-external", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "6a71c60466d9b1295dbb2bdcef135c5c306d46bd", "merged_at": "1635591895", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_2_X", "number": 35889, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "added check to avoid seg-fault in HLTScoutingPFProducer", "updated_at": "1635591895", "user": "missirol"}

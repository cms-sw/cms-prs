We will make it regular once the comparisons are available.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\n\r\nThis is not a backport\r\n\r\ncc: @tsusa @tvami @leaca", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1560710066", "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1560331212", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "9514f37d2a60c7004d03bc43dd45fece464933a5", "merged_at": "1560710066", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27181, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "update Pixel digitizer thresholds for Run3", "updated_at": "1560710066", "user": "mmusich"}

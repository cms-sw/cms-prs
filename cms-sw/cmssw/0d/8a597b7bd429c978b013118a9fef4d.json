The scenario D73 has been effectively replaced by scenarios D75 and D76 (Identical in terms of MTD content), and it has no more reason to exist, as it was made just for ETL v5 integration. The update of this geometry causes D73 to fail, but there is no benefit in fixing this, as its removal was already scheduled in discussions with the Upgrade software coordinator.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nAll the instances of the D73 string referring to the scenario in LXR look to have been addressed, and\r\n\r\n```\r\n10:38 cmsdev25 5309> runTheMatrix.py -n | grep D73 | wc -l\r\n0\r\n10:38 cmsdev25 5310> runTheMatrix.py -n --what upgrade | grep D73 | wc -l\r\n0\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe list of existing wfs is preserved (with the second commit).", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 11, "closed_at": "1613311760", "comments": 19, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1613119189", "deletions": 419, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "operations-approved", "orp-approved", "pdmv-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "b68775c36f80fa2e48af23b439aef7f78fd3fc05", "merged_at": "1613311759", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 32886, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "MTD geometry: remove obsolete geometry scenario D73, superseded by D75 and D76", "updated_at": "1613311760", "user": "fabiocos"}

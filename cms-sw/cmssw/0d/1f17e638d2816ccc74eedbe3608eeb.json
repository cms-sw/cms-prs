Commonly-used functions and constants are relocated to `CalibCalorimetry/HcalAlgos`, and some unused variables in the SiPM code are removed (along with other minor cleanup). The SiPM reco pulse template for HE is now calculated transparently by numerical convolution in `HcalPulseShapes`, instead of being calculated by the same algorithm in a private macro on my computer and then pasted in as a vector of non-reproducible values.\r\n\r\nBecause of the last change, there will be minor fluctuations in M2 results for 2017 HE, entirely caused by changes in rounding of the values in the reco pulse template.

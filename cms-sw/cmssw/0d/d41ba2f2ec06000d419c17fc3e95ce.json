In ROOT 5, this call was unnecessary, but caused no observed problems. In ROOT 6, this causes unnecessary unloading and reloading of ROOT plugins. CMS has no need for unloading, ever.\nThis pull request will remove the same call in the 7_1_X branch (ROOT5).  This maintains code commonality, and removes an unnecessary call that may adversely affect performance.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1398181629", "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1398110151", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["comparison-available", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "eee93cdb68c31a52311b0890ceda2800dea39307", "merged_at": "1398181629", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_1_0_pre7", "number": 3415, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Remove unnecessary call that causes unloading in ROOT6", "updated_at": "1398262755", "user": "wmtan"}

The diff in GTs is just in the visible IOVs:\r\n * https://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/126X_dataRun3_HLT_frozen_v1/126X_dataRun3_HLT_frozen_v2\r\n * https://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/126X_dataRun3_Express_frozen_v1/126X_dataRun3_Express_frozen_v2\r\n * https://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/126X_dataRun3_Prompt_frozen_v1/126X_dataRun3_Prompt_frozen_v2\r\n * https://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/126X_dataRun3_v1/126X_dataRun3_v2\r\n\r\nThere is a lot of things using `auto:run3_data`\r\nhttps://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/search?p=2&q=auto%3Arun3_data\r\nwhich we should probably revise, but that is beyond this PR.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntest parameters:\r\n  - workflows = 139.004\r\n ```\r\nruns fine.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

In that case Idle state is reflagged as Fwk (except if input source is waiting for input). This will cover time spend outside modules by threads from the pool.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nUnit tests pass.\r\nTested in DAQ3VAL system.\r\nMicrostate screenshot:\r\n<img width=\"797\" alt=\"image_thread_us\" src=\"https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/assets/5859622/f0a00bf2-81c8-4b11-94bb-5b1f57e3c396\">\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 13, "comments": 16, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1700682305", "deletions": 292, "labels": ["daq-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "number": 43368, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "DAQ - add ability to sample of per-tbb-thread microstate (14_0_X)", "updated_at": "1701283361", "user": "smorovic"}

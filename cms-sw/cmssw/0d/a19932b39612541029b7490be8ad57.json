It is planned to run the HG alignment in parallel to the LG alignment, with only the LG alignment updating the conditions. More details can also be found in [1].\r\n\r\nIn detail the following things are changed/added in this PR:\r\n\r\n- Adapt `MillePedeFileReader` and `MillePedeDQMModule` to read and store the high granularity alignment\r\n- Read and use the new thresholds in `MillePedeDQMModule` and `MillePedeAlignmentAlgorithm`\r\n- Store/read the pede results for the HG alignment in/from a separate folder, to avoid overwriting the LG result in the harvesting step.\r\n- Two new methods in the new HG threshold object, to get and store the float maps\r\n- Add workflows for the production and the harvesting required for the HG alignment in `CommonAlignmentProducer`\r\n- Add the new workflows to the PCL configuration\r\n- Add the LG and HG alignment to the `1001.2` workflows, which can be used with the `runTheMatrix.py` command\r\n- Add a relval customizer in `CommonAlignmentProducer` to override the 20 LS veto and required entries per structure in the HG aligment\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nThe PR can be tested using the adapted relval workflow with `runTheMatrix.py -l 1001.2`.\r\n\r\ncc:\r\n@mmusich, @connorpa, @antoniovagnerini, @consuegs\r\n\r\n[1] https://indico.cern.ch/event/1167313/contributions/4906905/attachments/2461217/4219804/AlCaDB_Meeting_13_06_22.pdf\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 34, "closed_at": "1656070606", "comments": 44, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1655804000", "deletions": 123, "labels": ["alca-approved", "operations-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "pdmv-approved", "db-approved", "orp-approved", "urgent", "upgrade-approved", "code-checks-approved", "trk"], "merge_commit_sha": "0f0c0f386988fd5bab9233ee34166f43bc4c6c18", "merged_at": "1656070606", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 38449, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 33, "state": "closed", "title": "New high granularity pixel alignment for the PCL", "updated_at": "1656070607", "user": "dmeuser"}

Note that only \"One\" type modules that declare\nTFileService as a shared resource will be able to use it\nin multithreaded mode. TFileDirectory is now a thread local\nmember instead of being a base class of TFileService. This\nchange required some code that uses to the service to be\nmodified. Add Framework code that keeps track of the modules\nactive on the current thread and make this available to\nthe service through the context passed to the service.\nRemove a couple unneeded includes in RecoParticleFlow\nthat were causing problems.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 28, "closed_at": "1378919725", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1378473653", "deletions": 245, "labels": ["alca-pending", "analysis-approved", "core-approved", "dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "28edc536f21f8fa75ac5bd875921d7f1e84cb8dc", "merged_at": "1378919725", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_0_0_pre4", "number": 731, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Multithreaded TFileService", "updated_at": "1383934632", "user": "wddgit"}

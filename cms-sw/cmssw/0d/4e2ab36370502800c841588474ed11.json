One of these is OwnVector, which also supports unique_ptr. This PR changes every user of OwnVector that uses auto_ptr to use unique_ptr instead. and removes support for auto_ptr in OwnVector. It also uses std::make_unique when appropriate.\nThis PR also changes a very small number of auto_ptr's to unique_ptr's unrelated to OwnVector in files that were modified anyway.\nIn cases where auto_ptr was passed by reference (a bad practice), the code was modified to pass unique_ptr by value in those cases where ownership is being transferred, and to pass a bare pointer (get()) in cases where ownership is not transferred,\n This PR is totally technical.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 15, "closed_at": "1460457594", "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1460293897", "deletions": 83, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-available", "core-approved", "fastsim-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-rejected"], "merge_commit_sha": "cdf09f0b28f93694033d7d6c84799218403a40b8", "merged_at": "1460457594", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 14009, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "OwnVector should use unique_ptr, not auto_ptr", "updated_at": "1464230070", "user": "wmtan"}

There should be no effect in standard phase0/1/2 workflows. I guess in principle the special workflows `10024.[23]` (employing `Run2_2017_trackingRun2` era) could be affected via jetCore iteration, but with 10 events in runTheMatrix I saw no differences.\n\n@rovere @VinInn \n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1471495110", "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1471428481", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["comparison-available", "new-package-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "a1d95b4b046aef9a7d5f9d93f376ed6ef6ecce9e", "merged_at": "1471495110", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 15495, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add run2_HE2017 to 2017 special tracking eras", "updated_at": "1471495111", "user": "makortel"}

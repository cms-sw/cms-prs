(Or, alternatively, tell me how to test it: wf  136.8522 does not seem to pick it)\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nIt builds without errors\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1608247701", "comments": 15, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1608209399", "deletions": 36, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "d12b014d9dc6ae8ce897d45143c9fc738df4e2ae", "merged_at": "1608247701", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 32521, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Range based loop in PPSFilteredProtonProducer", "updated_at": "1608247702", "user": "perrotta"}

There were 11 .cc files containing 'cout' in print() functions, They have all been converted to LogVerbatim. I've only tested some of them but that's fine because they're never used in production anyway - they're used for expert debugging only. The standard  \"runTheMatrix.py -s --useInput all\" tests run fine, unsurprisingly, in 7_5_X. I was assured by Chris Jones that making this change should not affect the Digi structure, or break compatibility in any way :)\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 11, "closed_at": "1425406339", "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1425400593", "deletions": 99, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "845e320d891875c68f42adb51b54fa2e343aa14f", "merged_at": "1425406339", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 8041, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "cout replaced by LogVerbatim", "updated_at": "1425406340", "user": "ptcox"}

This can cause thread safety problems in a multithreaded framework.  This pull request registers the empty parentage vector once up front during event processor initialization, and removes the registration from the output module.\nThis request also makes two C++ 11 improvements to RootOutputFile.cc\n1) The use of range for loops when appropriate.\n2) Use of nullptr rather than 0 when appropriate.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1376468568", "comments": 2, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1376429169", "deletions": 78, "labels": [], "merge_commit_sha": "8aa8a7b1d8cb124e6ff49820e231f07120b3d954", "merged_at": "1376468568", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_0_0_pre3", "number": 308, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "Register empty parentage up front", "updated_at": "1404155639", "user": "wmtan"}

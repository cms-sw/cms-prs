If a file written prior to CMSSW_5_0_0 is read in CMSSW_5_0_0 or later, this \"LHC\" process is added retroactively, which affects the process history.  The process history must then be retroactively modified.\nThis worked fine until CMSSW_6_2_0, when a bug was introduced.  There is a map used to map the old process history to the new.  In 6_2_0, the entry for an empty old process history was incorrectly omitted from the map.  Real raw data prior to CMSSW_5_0_0 had an empty process history.  So, the process history ID for real raw data was not found in the map. and a fatal assert fired.\nThe fix is to simply add the missing entry to the map.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1392931131", "comments": 4, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1392748017", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["core-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "845240b77bff94f7ac0a8115a5d9c51aba53493c", "merged_at": "1392931131", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "number": 2521, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Don't try to update empty process history ID", "updated_at": "1393008231", "user": "wmtan"}

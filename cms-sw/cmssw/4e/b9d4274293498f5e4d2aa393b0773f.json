The produced configurations before and after this PR are not exactly the same. Functionally they are, with the exception that with this PR the castor reconstruction modules are run (following #13591).\n\nThe only non-straightforward part was the treatment of non-splitted `siPixelClusters` for the `Phase1PU70` tracking. The issue was discussed in #13381 and in March 3 RECO meeting https://indico.cern.ch/event/505422/contribution/5/attachments/1237476/1817746/slides_trk_phase1_era.pdf, and the impelemented way is to use both `siPixelClustersPreSplitting` and `siPixelClusters` for non-splitted clusters for `Phase1PU70`.\n\nNext step is to switch the default 2017 tracking to the one in #13149 (`Phase1PU70` will be left as a reference that can be switched on with `Run2_2017_trackingPhase1PU70` era).\n\nTested in CMSSW_8_1_X_2016-03-08-2300 (`runTheMatrix.py -i all -l limited,25202.0,10024.0,10224.0`), no changes expected in monitored quantities.\n\n@rovere @VinInn \n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 21, "closed_at": "1458030985", "comments": 10, "commits": 9, "created_at": "1457533026", "deletions": 113, "labels": ["comparison-available", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "09ffd22211ace4a7036b1560f38316d970671d99", "merged_at": "1458030985", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 13666, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Migrate remaining 2017 reco customizations to era", "updated_at": "1476957170", "user": "makortel"}

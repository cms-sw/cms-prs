If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nYes this is a Backport to 14_0_X of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/44691 . A backport is needed so these changes can be included in NanoAODv14.\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 4, "commits": 13, "created_at": "1712919178", "deletions": 148, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-rejected", "orp-pending", "xpog-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "number": 44723, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[14_0_X] Add Unified ParT to tau NanoAOD (Backport)", "updated_at": "1713027529", "user": "lucasrussell01"}

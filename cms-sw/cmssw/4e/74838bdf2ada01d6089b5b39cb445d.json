The changes proposed does not affect the performance of the l1 trigger. The extra member `ptNoVtx` will only be filled in phase-2 scenarios where displaced muon triggers are enabled. It should not be used in Run-2 or Run-3 scenarios. The default value is 0.\r\n\r\n@tahuang1991", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1505241982", "comments": 29, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1500309640", "deletions": 8, "labels": ["code-checks-pending", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_9_4_X", "number": 19780, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add displaced pT measurement to L1T::Muon object", "updated_at": "1512593612", "user": "dildick"}

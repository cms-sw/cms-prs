This is needed to address the issue #40090, which describe crash in Geant4 tracking due to corrupted pointers in some special condition. Similar report was discussed at the recent Simulation meeting, which concerns on StackingAction at the same place, when Run-2 simulation is performed in 12_6_X release. The problem is not very frequent but should be fixed.   \r\n\r\nAny physics result should be not affected.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nprivate\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

This only affects\nunit tests.\n\nPreviously, the test forked a process to\nmake input files and then was supposed to\nwait for it to finish, but sometimes it\ndid not wait for reasons I do not understand.\nI simplified this by splitting it into two\ntests and used the scram PRE_TEST flag to\nsequence them.\n\nThe DataFormats/FWLite tests used the same\nfilenames as the FWCore/FWLite unit tests\nin the same directory. I renamed the files\nand modified the test to run in the tmp\nsubdirectory to avoid potential clashes if\nthe tests were run at the same time.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 8, "closed_at": "1427918696", "comments": 9, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1427905862", "deletions": 46, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "e40c317f1ebc8a6a902768d1d75fa7ceaa1a02df", "merged_at": "1427918696", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 8634, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix unit test", "updated_at": "1432057523", "user": "wddgit"}

It has been introduced the possibility to check if the selection done on DetId bits and the one done using the TkTopology are the same. \n@boudoul @delaere @venturia\n", "branch": "CMSSW_6_2_SLHCDEV_X", "changed_files": 584, "closed_at": "1452607176", "comments": 7, "commits": 296, "created_at": "1449922344", "deletions": 90057, "labels": ["alca-pending", "analysis-pending", "comparison-pending", "dqm-pending", "fastsim-pending", "geometry-pending", "l1-pending", "pdmv-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "Next CMSSW_6_2_SLHCDEV_X", "number": 12771, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "Fixing tracking reconstruction", "updated_at": "1452607176", "user": "ebrondol"}

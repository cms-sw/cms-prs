The algorithm iterates over T5s to identify duplicates eligible for merging, requiring that they pass a set of selections and originate from different layers. A new kernel, ExtendTrackCandidatesFromDupT5, merges hits from the highest-scoring duplicates into LST track candidates. About 70% of LST T5 and pT5 track candidates gain additional hits, improving pT resolution and increasing track candidate length with negligible impact on timing.\r\n\r\nMore info:  [LST Duplicate Merging.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/24135950/LST.Duplicate.Merging.pdf)\r\n\r\n<img height=\"400\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-12-11 at 11 40 44PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b71b8253-b17b-4228-a070-136035e9f7d1\" />\r\n\r\ncc. @slava77 ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 16, "closed_at": "1765874253", "comments": 10, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1765571723", "deletions": 143, "labels": ["core-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved", "tracking", "changes-dataformats"], "merge_commit_sha": "5e0394e4f4aa52d65693f4aa1a527b460c1f8ee0", "merged_at": "1765874253", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_16_0_X", "number": 49623, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "LST: T5-T5 Duplicate Merging", "updated_at": "1765874254", "user": "GNiendorf"}

Perhaps @cms-sw/rpc-dpg-l2 can decide that a more convenient fix could be simply to remove it from CMSSW as a whole, thus avoiding having to maintain some code which is not needed any more\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nIt builds\r\n`runTheMatrix.py -l 136.787` ends without errors\r\n\r\nI did not check with UBSAN, because this error is apparently not listed any more in the UBSAN IB builds, see e.g. https://cmssdt.cern.ch/SDT/html/cmssdt-ib/#/relVal/CMSSW_12_4/2022-05-06-1100?selectedArchs=slc7_amd64_gcc11&selectedFlavors=UBSAN_X&selectedStatus=failed\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1652762224", "comments": 40, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1651903464", "deletions": 22, "labels": ["dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "bug-fix", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "3f9cbd7f6c08fd60dddda5b633c41cc9f469b407", "merged_at": "1652762224", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 37853, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix DQM_L1TMonitor_L1TStage2EMTF: there are four RPC planes in the Endcaps", "updated_at": "1652762224", "user": "perrotta"}

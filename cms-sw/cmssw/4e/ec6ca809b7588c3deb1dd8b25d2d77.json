Currently a constant resolution of 25 ps is used for both the BTL and the ETL. \r\nThe code update proposed in this PR introduces more realistic parameterizations for the RecHit time uncertainties.\r\n\r\nIn the case of ETL, for the time being a constant value is used, but the framework has been setup for a more realistic function dependence.\r\n\r\nDetails are provided in [this](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1019342/contributions/4278150/attachments/2212249/3744576/casarsa_rechitTimeError.pdf) presentation at the MTD DPG Meeting on 19/03/2021.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe updated code has been tested with a TTBar sample (WF 34634) in the CMSSW release 11_3_0_pre4.\r\nThe values of the RecHits amplitudes and times match 1-to-1 and the RecHits time errors are consistent with the provided parameterizations.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1617277696", "comments": 27, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1616161607", "deletions": 12, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "requires-external", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "80b1dba752db6f78915569fed5af97f1948fadcd", "merged_at": "1617277696", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 33223, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 6, "state": "closed", "title": "MTD local reconstruction: new parameterizations for the RecHits time uncertainty  ", "updated_at": "1617277696", "user": "casarsa"}

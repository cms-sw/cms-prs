The PortableCollection interface does not provide a way to check the state, and therefore a caller has no way to know if `PortableCollection::buffer()` leads to defined or undefined behavior (because [`std::optional<T>::operator*()` leads to undefined behavior if the `optional` does not contain value](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/optional/operator*)). This PR takes one attempt to add a function `PortableCollection::isValid()` that allows checking the validity, and adds `assert()`s to all accessors (plus `size()` to be able to access the SoA size without the `assert()`. I'm not sure if this the behavior we really want, but at least it is a starting point for a discussion.\r\n\r\nThe tests for 0-size SoA Layout and PortableCollection are for ensuring valid behavior when the SoA has also scalars in addition to columns. (and now I'm wondering what should be the behavior of a 0-size PortableCollection for a SoA that has only columns?)\r\n\r\nThe PortableObject and PortableMultiCollection should also be treated consistently, but I wanted to get feedback first on the direction we want to go first.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nUnit tests pass\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

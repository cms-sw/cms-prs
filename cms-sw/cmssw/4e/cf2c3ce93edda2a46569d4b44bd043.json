In particular, it adds a check for tracks in ETL with hits in both forward discs, and an alternative study using reconstructed tracks, matched with a ```TrackingParticle``` which is found to have given origin to MTD hits. This association is built in ```Validation/MtdTracksValidation``` based on the track and event id stored in ```PSimHit```. A dedicated study, switched off by default and activated with a flag ```optionalPlots``` allows the study of the performance of this matching approach.\r\n\r\nA BTL local reconstruction harvesting is also added to study the BTL reconstructed hits occupancy as a function of energy.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe code has been extensively used on 100k single muons and pions (private production) and on RelVal TTbar events from CMSSW_12_5_0_pre2.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 7, "comments": 2, "commits": 12, "created_at": "1655734951", "deletions": 205, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 38444, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "MTD Validation: expand track-hits matching efficiency", "updated_at": "1655735353", "user": "fabiocos"}

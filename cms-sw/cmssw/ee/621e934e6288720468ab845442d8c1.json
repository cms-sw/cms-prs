We are still finalizing the NanoAOD integration and testing for parsing corner cases. We expect these tests to be wrapped up in a couple of weeks, but because of the scale of the changes, it would be useful to have feedback already (I'm sure there will be lost of coding suggestions).\r\n\r\nThis builds on the work of several people, including @dteague @sroychow @guitargeek @cericeci\r\n\r\n@agrohsje and @kpedro88 have contributed to the design and review.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nWe have validated MiniAOD --> NanoAOD, adding products to the event, and GEN-->NanoAOD instantiating products to files. A large testing campaign will take place before NanoAOD v9 and we will report the status here.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 47, "comments": 40, "commits": 268, "created_at": "1605645236", "deletions": 1207, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "generators-pending", "operations-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending", "xpog-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 32167, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "open", "title": "[WIP] Refactoring gen weight storage in EDM + Nano integration", "updated_at": "1641470222", "user": "kdlong"}

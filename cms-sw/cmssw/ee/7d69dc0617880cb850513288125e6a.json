I only looked at files using the deprecated JetCorrector class.\r\n\r\nThis migration was easy, although it took a bit of time to read through the files to decide what to do. I deleted all of them. These are all ancient \"example modules\". The problem is that all of them are so full of deprecated non-functional code that it would be harmful for someone to read as an example. 10 to 15 years ago these might have been useful, but at this point deleting them is a positive thing independent of the JetCorrector issue. We should not be using resources to distribute, build, and maintain code like this.\r\n\r\nSome of the problems:\r\n\r\n- Don't call consumes and use getByLabel (fails).\r\n- Use deprecated JetCorrector (fails).\r\n- No unit tests or relVal tests.\r\n- Nothing references any of these other than test configs also deleted\r\n- Configs load cff files that no longer exist\r\n- Use corrections that no longer exist\r\n- Ancient input files that probably no longer exist\r\n- There is nothing deep and useful that really needs saving\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nOnly deletions. Nothing to test. Nothing could be using them because they don't work anymore.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 11, "comments": 0, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1666804944", "deletions": 1466, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_6_X", "number": 39864, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "JetCorrector Migration, RecoJets/JetAnalyzers", "updated_at": "1666804962", "user": "wddgit"}

If this poses a problem it could be mitigated in a follow-up using ad-hoc LS-merging.\r\nAlso in real data applications https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/42995 might play a role.\r\nOpening as a draft for comments for now.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n`runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos` runs fine.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

We added a protection in the combination code to only use the Ep combination MVA at high energies when the track pT error is smaller than 10 times the track pT. It is a pretty safe cut that removes these badly measured tracks from the determination of the electron energy.\n\nReference: https://hypernews.cern.ch/HyperNews/CMS/get/physTools/3446/1/1/1/1.html\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1456218666", "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1455632469", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "d7a3c8e20c1c7b61384b6110a4356c72e0a8cc1b", "merged_at": "1456218666", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 13301, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Ep combination protection reco 76", "updated_at": "1485955640", "user": "rafaellopesdesa"}

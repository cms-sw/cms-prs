These plots are built by a dedicated module ElasticPlotDQMSource which is by default not included in the processing sequence. It is agreed with the DQM team that the module can be included for the special runs upon our demand.\r\n\r\nThe updated code was tested on the data from the 2018 CTPPS run with this config: DQM/CTPPS/test/all_ctpps_dqm_test_from_aod_cfg.py.\r\n\r\n``runTheMatrix.py -l limited`` gave ``23 22 21 17 9 1 1 1 1 tests passed, 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 failed``. The two failing tests\r\n  * 4.22: Step0-DAS_ERROR\r\n  * 136.7611: Step1-FAILED\r\n\r\ndon't seem related to this PR.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 12, "comments": 22, "commits": 22, "created_at": "1524232694", "deletions": 660, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "orp-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 23025, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "CTPPS: DQM update", "updated_at": "1525346231", "user": "jan-kaspar"}

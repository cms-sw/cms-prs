The efficiency is computed using the standard DQMGenericClient,\nusing as numerator the number of valid hits for each tracker\ncomponent, and as denominator the sum of valid and missing hits. All\ncategories of missing hits are considered. Hits flagged as inactive or\nbad are not taken into account, but anyway recorded in other\nhistograms, in case we want to monitor also their efficiencies. The\nefficiencies are computed wrt the number of good vertices found in\neach event. The selection of \"good vertex\" is the recommended one:\nndof>=4 and isFake is False. Only events with at least one good vertex\nare monitored. The code is active by default in Tier-0 processing and,\nin general, everytime standard DQM Tracking is active. Both\ngeneralTracks and highPurityTracks/pt_1 are monitored separately. The\nTracker Geometry has been used as much as possible to make the code\nUpgrade friendly.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 8, "closed_at": "1479228016", "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1443435210", "deletions": 52, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 11524, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add tracking hit-finding efficiency from HitPattern", "updated_at": "1479228017", "user": "rovere"}

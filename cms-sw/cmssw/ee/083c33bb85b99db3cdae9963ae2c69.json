Previously, these cuts were effectively hard-coded. This is a follow up of an observation presented e.g. in [Proton POG meeting 26 Nov 2019](https://indico.cern.ch/event/865518/contributions/3648775/attachments/1951600/3240029/kaspar_dpg_timing_eff.pdf) (slide 5), showing that the current cuts a little too strict. In order to maintain the backward compatibility, this PR keeps the default cut values as before.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe plot below compares proton reconstruction results for different periods (rows) and different CMSSW versions/settiings (colours). Comparing blue (before this PR) with red dashed (this PR, default cuts) shows that there is no difference in results. Comparing red dashed (default cuts) with green (enlarged cuts) shows that more reco-proton objects include non-zero number of timing-RP tracks.\r\n\r\n![make_cmp](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17830858/70791259-0f2b8900-1d97-11ea-8210-9dd68eb6e9fb.png)\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1576570865", "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1576227690", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "9df6b3ea4f96df2c698c699eb715782ae23161e1", "merged_at": "1576570865", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 28621, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "PPS: configurable timing-tracking cut", "updated_at": "1576570865", "user": "jan-kaspar"}

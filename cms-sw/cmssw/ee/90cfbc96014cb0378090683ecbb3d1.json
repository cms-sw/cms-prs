However, some of the fits are failing. This was not resulting in errors so far, but with the switch to Minuit2 by default in ROOT 6.30 it will.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that it uses chi-square fits to fit slices with many empty bins, which is not appropriate. Doing a likelihood fit with the `\"l\"` option is one way to fix the problem, because it can better deal with empty bins.\r\n\r\nThanks to @lmoneta for this suggestion!\r\nSee https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/13852\r\n\r\nCloses #42979.\r\n\r\n@smuzaffar, needs to be tested with ROOT master or 6.30 if possible.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1698178816", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_3_X", "number": 43106, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Use likelihood fit instead of chi-square fit in DQMServices slice fits", "updated_at": "1698254327", "user": "guitargeek"}

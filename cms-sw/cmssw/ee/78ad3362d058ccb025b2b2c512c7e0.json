This PR extends the matching to recover such cases, by adding the possibility that electrons can be matched to gendressed particles. This issue has been reported here:\r\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/962278/contributions/4060711/attachments/2136665/3599026/electron_matching_nano_nov4.pdf\r\n\r\nand further discussed here:\r\n\r\ncms-nanoAOD#552\r\n\r\nThe electron matching is performed as follows:\r\n\r\n    Electrons are first matched to a collection of dressed electrons. This collection is identical to the GenDressedLepton collection that is stored in nanoAOD, but with a looser pt cut. If there's a match, the Electron_genPartFlav variable is set to 1 or 15, depending on the mother of the dressed lepton. Electron_genPartIdx is the index of the electron en GenPart that corresponds to the constituent of the matched dressed leptons with highest pt and abs(pdgId)==11.\r\n    For the electrons not matched in the previous step, the logic is the same as in the previous implementation: electrons are matched to GenPart and then Electron_genPartIdx and Electron_genPartFlav are assigned according to this match.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1622365776", "comments": 26, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1617726973", "deletions": 155, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "backport-ok", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved", "xpog-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "effc7e1d776bd18469d4db5754f2ac9c22cf109a", "merged_at": "1622365776", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 33347, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "Extension of electron matching in nanoAOD (backport)", "updated_at": "1622365777", "user": "sscruz"}

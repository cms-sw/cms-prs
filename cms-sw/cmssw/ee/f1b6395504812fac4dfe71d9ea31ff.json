The upgraded PhaseII Link Boards would be able to measure more precisely the RPC time, thus enabling precise time for the whole RPC system. The PR enables upgraded PhaseII Link Board readout to be simulated.  \r\n\r\nWe have added also an option to turn on/off electron digitization in the same way as it's done in the following PR:\r\n#https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/17898", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 8, "closed_at": "1493961870", "comments": 52, "commits": 9, "created_at": "1493241927", "deletions": 23, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "4c8ecd13ebd62fbb3a597440c959e2094f13d399", "merged_at": "1493961870", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_2_X", "number": 18488, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Link board upgrade", "updated_at": "1493961870", "user": "bapavlov"}

The two PRs are not mutually exclusive (in principle, both could be integrated).\r\n\r\nIn this PR, the edge case where `ldir.z() == 0` inside the `fastProp` method of `RecHitPropagator.h` is handled gracefully by returning an invalid `TrajectoryStateOnSurface`, which is then skipped in the method `TkGluedMeasurementDet::doubleMatch` (which is the only method that makes use of `fastProp`).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nManual checks with the reproducers in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/40174#issuecomment-1598702425 and https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/40174#issuecomment-1625219782.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

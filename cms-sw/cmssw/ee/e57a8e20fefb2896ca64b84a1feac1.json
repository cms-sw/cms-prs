Now the warp size is taken from the `__AMDGCN_WAVEFRONT_SIZE` macro for HIP and uses 32 for CUDA.\r\n\r\nNote that `alpaka::warp::getSize(acc)` cannot be used because it's evaluated at runtime.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\ntested on wf 12834.402", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1729247666", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1729176031", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved", "trk"], "merge_commit_sha": "7f10436c35ccaec6fe3e60ca69cbde026e41eeb2", "merged_at": "1729247666", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_14_2_X", "number": 46426, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Generalize warp size in pixel clustering kernel", "updated_at": "1729247667", "user": "AuroraPerego"}

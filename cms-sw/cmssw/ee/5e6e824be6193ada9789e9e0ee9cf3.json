It can even handle interleaving Events from two different LuminosityBlocks before the previous LuminosityBlock ends.\r\n\r\nThe PoolSource can read files containing such interleaved Events. When reading back, it returns all the Events for one LuminosityBlock before going onto the next LuminosityBlock. [We already did such behavior in the cases where the output file was created by a job which read the LuminosityBlock from different files].", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 8, "comments": 25, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1519938240", "deletions": 77, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "core-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-started"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_1_X", "number": 22406, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Make ROOT file support concurrent LuminosityBlocks", "updated_at": "1520457562", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

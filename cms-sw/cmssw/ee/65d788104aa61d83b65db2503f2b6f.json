The segfault is due to two things:\n1) A missing dictionary for a class that needs a TypeWithDict constructed\n2) An incorrect check in TypeWithDict for the presence of the dictionary.\nThis pull request fixes the invalid check, so that test 1001 will throw a proper exception due to the missing dictionary.  The missing dictionary will be added lter in a separate pull request.\nThis pull request also converts many calls to abort(), used for testing purposes, to throw exceptions instead.\nPlease merge promptly unless there are issues.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_2_ROOT6_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1401768431", "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1401749107", "deletions": 77, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "core-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "8a91c028c78ee8885f31bb3c72f42559e1485b99", "merged_at": "1401768431", "merged_by": "davidlt", "number": 4094, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix check for valid type with dictionary", "updated_at": "1402936600", "user": "wmtan"}

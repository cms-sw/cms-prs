This\r\n  makes the HGCAL geometry rendering much much faster than before.\r\n* Use the newly introduced parameters/topology information to gather\r\n  information about a specific HGCAL detId. Avoid detId unpacking.\r\n* Remove ad-hoc magic numbers while offsetting layers in the hadronic\r\n  section.\r\n* Color coding for the Silicon sensor is now bound to their thickness,\r\n  with the following colour coding:\r\n  * red is 120 um sensor\r\n  * blue is 200 um sensor\r\n  * green is 300 um sensor\r\n\r\n##### Improve Trackster{Layer,Hits} Proxies\r\n* Position lines (centres of LayerClusters) [and seed lines for the\r\n  `Hits` Proxy] are now registered to a single `TEveStraightLineSet`.\r\n  They are, as a consequence, a single entity in the GUI, and the\r\n  selection will highlight them all for each trackster, individually.\r\n* Edges are now partitioned in two `TEveStraightLineSet`: non-adjacent\r\n  edges (spans more than one layer) and adjacent edges (between sibling\r\n  layers). Non-adjacent edges are rendered in red, while adjacent edges\r\n  in yellow.\r\n* Add transparency support for the `Layer` proxy. Still not fully\r\n  automated, but working.\r\n* Keep colour memory between consecutive switches between `heat map` and\r\n  full colour rendering.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1634078376", "comments": 7, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1634047586", "deletions": 130, "labels": ["visualization-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "2cc775fc24d2a81f5be088dbff6340d6f00c0fa9", "merged_at": "1634078376", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "number": 35626, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Improve fireworks geometry and proxies", "updated_at": "1634078376", "user": "rovere"}

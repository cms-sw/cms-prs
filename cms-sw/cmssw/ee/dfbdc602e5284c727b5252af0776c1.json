This PR makes the `SwitchProducer` to work with `ConditionalTask` with the following changes\r\n* `SwitchProducer` case module objects get now their module labels set (previously they were not).\r\n  * This change lead to #37562. I checked all other uses of `SwitchProducerCUDA` and the case modules were always either defined inline or cloned from other module objects\r\n* In python, if `SwitchProducer` is on a `ConditionalTask` or in a `Path`, the case modules get treated as if they were in an anonymous `ConditionalTask` associated with the `ConditionalTask`/`Path`\r\n* `SwitchProducer` with an `EDAlias` as a chosen case required adding those `EDAlias`es into the `ProductRegistry` so that the `callWhenNewProductsRegistered()` callbacks in `SwitchProducer` get called, that lead to data product consumption being properly registered, that is needed for the module dependence checks in `StreamSchedule::tryToPlaceConditionalModules()`\r\n  * This step required moving `processEDAliases()` function out from `Schedule.cc`\r\n* The tests I added for `SwitchProducer` with `EDAlias` also revealed that the `EDAlias` treatment was generally broken for `ConditionalTask`. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nFramework unit tests run. The HLT test in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/36938#issuecomment-1090262706 runs as well.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 13, "closed_at": "1650462808", "comments": 21, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1649888463", "deletions": 234, "labels": ["core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-rejected", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "9554e9cdd0db54781f540b940825296725e25219", "merged_at": "1650462808", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 37563, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 24, "state": "closed", "title": "Make SwitchProducer work with ConditionalTask", "updated_at": "1650462808", "user": "makortel"}

These iterations don't change the muon reconstruction efficiency, so removing them saves a bit of time in reconstruction.\n- fixing the algorithm name assigned to tracks found by muon regit, with an existing name. The tracks are assigned the flag \"undefAlgorithm\", this can be changed if someone has a strong opinion about it.\n\nDocumentation of the effect of these changes on the reconstruction performance and resources needed is under finalization and made available very soon. As stated above, the HI muon reconstruction is basically unchanged, only a little bit faster.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 9, "closed_at": "1431918142", "comments": 16, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1431413601", "deletions": 37, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "a16535aa840684656dd5f4fa05a65bac009ddaa1", "merged_at": "1431918142", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 9049, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "Update of muon regional iterative tracking in HI reco", "updated_at": "1431918142", "user": "echapon"}

While running these scripts, I noticed some minor issues I decided to fix.\r\n\r\nThe `create*Payloads.sh` scripts in this PR were issuing an unnecessary warning about a missing optional `txt` file. I added a test to silence it.\r\n\r\nFor the `runDDDvsDBGeometryValidation.sh` script, I added support for scenarios that have names like \"Extended2017Plan1\".\r\n\r\nMore fixes and enhancements could be added to these scripts, but those will have to wait for a later PR.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThese scripts are only run manually, so they don't affect any workflows. I checked that the fixes in this PR do work.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1587048712", "comments": 13, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1586555958", "deletions": 9, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "db-approved", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "cd0b3847cf743336559f79582bf0523f659eb0b2", "merged_at": "1587048712", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 29458, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Small fixes to special DB payload scripts", "updated_at": "1587048712", "user": "cvuosalo"}

Before, the tracks coming from the antiparticles were not looked at, to see if the antiparticles stop in the detector. This is fixed with the one line change in Exotica_HSCP_SIM_cfi.py.\n- To better debug this type of problem in the future, more debug statements were added to RHStopTracer.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1426510782", "comments": 15, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1426270176", "deletions": 39, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "fully-signed", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "1c5771004ba45372ecd849f442ffd9c3d56e654f", "merged_at": "1426510782", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 8282, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "StoppedParticles Bug Fix", "updated_at": "1426516834", "user": "jalimena"}

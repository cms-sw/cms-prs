This simple pull request adds one line of code to keep each of the other two needed product types. Note: This mixing currently works accidentally if only one pileup file is specified, because the first pileup file is opened at construction time, before the list of product types to be dropped is activated. So, Sim/Reco level mixing fails only if more than one pileup file is specified. This pull request fixes the failure.\nThis problem was reported by Jason Gran.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_3_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1422985747", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1422483123", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "313023a8f56f8cc2a58dbb8dcb3dc57ede4e5287", "merged_at": "1422985747", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_3_X", "number": 7439, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Activate all products needed by Sim/Reco-level mixing (in 7_3_X)", "updated_at": "1422987201", "user": "wmtan"}

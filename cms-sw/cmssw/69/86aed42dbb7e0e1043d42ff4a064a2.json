This PR corrects the bug and revives and modernizes an old unit test that would have caught this.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRevived the unit test.  Verified that it segfaulted.  Modified `fwlite::ChainEvent()` to throw instead of faulting, verified that the unit test succeeded.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1619718425", "comments": 13, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1619545028", "deletions": 46, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "b80ddf6ea5e0afcb2b7434e7e70e45cbbde540d9", "merged_at": "1619718425", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "number": 33550, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "Throw on missing file in ChainEvent, revive unit tests that would have caught this", "updated_at": "1619718425", "user": "dan131riley"}

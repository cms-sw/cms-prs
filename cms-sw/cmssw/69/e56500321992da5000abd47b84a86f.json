It has now been fixed. As a result, TTTrack::d0() and TTTrack::getD0() return identical values for the track impact parameter, aside from the small loss of resolution in the latter function caused by the d0 being digitized and then undigitized again.\r\n\r\nThis bug was pointed out by Ryan Mccarthy @ryanm124 .", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1729001115", "comments": 11, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1727704534", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["l1-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "upgrade-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "019916dc74e3941ed81a007ac465f69f84e15fd7", "merged_at": "1729001115", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_14_2_X", "number": 46159, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix d0 bug", "updated_at": "1729001116", "user": "tomalin"}

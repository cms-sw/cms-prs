This can be fixed by including some headers from the standard library:\r\n\r\n1. `#include <limits>` in FWCore/Utilities/interface/ESIndices.h to get `std::numeric_limits`\r\n2. `#include <string>` in FWCore/ServiceRegistry/interface/ActivityRegistry.h to get `std::string`\r\n\r\nI don't know how it compiled before in older gcc. Maybe it got these missing headers indirectly from other standard library headers like `functional`, but they are not in there anymore?\r\n\r\nThis opportunity was taken to also clean the BuildFiles in FWCore: dependencies which are not actually included in the library were removed or moved to the `plugins` BuildFile if appropriate.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCMSSW compiles.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nNo backport intended.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1590415214", "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1590224746", "deletions": 8, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "fa9c02a6e2012ea58594b839b617ddea37c5f07f", "merged_at": "1590415214", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 29961, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add missing std library includes in FWCore", "updated_at": "1590415214", "user": "guitargeek"}

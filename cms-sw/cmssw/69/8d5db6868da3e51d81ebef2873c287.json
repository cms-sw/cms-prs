This PR has the straightforward approach, i.e. to define 6 ESGetTokens and then decide in produce() which of the 6 possible tokens to use for the get().\r\n\r\nBut this approach (alone) is not necessarily what we want, as naively it would lead the framework to load both payloads in prefetching (or those that are available in the GlobalTag, by quick look both are in the run2 offline reco GT).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles, no changes expected.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1560862210", "comments": 8, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1559695094", "deletions": 169, "labels": ["alca-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-notrun", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-rejected"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27099, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "[RFC] Migrate SiStripBackPlaneCorrectionDepESProducer and SiStripLorentzAngleDepESProducer to EventSetup consumes", "updated_at": "1560862210", "user": "makortel"}

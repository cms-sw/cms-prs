All python cfg files have been modified to account for these new parameters (also in DQM/BeamMonitor and in Calibration/TkAlCaRecoProducers).\r\nThe default values of the parameters are set so that nothing changes with respect to the previous situation.\r\nWe added a further switch to prevent the program from crashing when the needed track collection is not found: in that case the PVselection is not applied.\r\nI also did some \"cleaning\" (removed \"tabs\" and useless commented lines) in order to have more or less the same indendation in all the files.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 8, "closed_at": "1495631872", "comments": 29, "commits": 9, "created_at": "1494882274", "deletions": 215, "labels": ["alca-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "09f887db1b894bbed334aa11b8f5b21090685446", "merged_at": "1495631872", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_2_X", "number": 18755, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "CMSSW 92X - Adding the possibility to select the PVs before the BeamSpot fit", "updated_at": "1495631872", "user": "francescobrivio"}

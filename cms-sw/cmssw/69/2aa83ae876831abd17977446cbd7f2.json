This was probably due to the fact that in the past two getByLabels for the different types were sharing the same InputTag. This was probably not seen since the product is only optionally obtained.\n\nThese changes are a prequel to internal framework changes which can affect castTo.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1418221951", "comments": 6, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1418083461", "deletions": 72, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "301f1441a7d4d7dbcfc4afb845a3789e2830e8f1", "merged_at": "1418221951", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 6833, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Removed poor use of Ref classes in PFTracking and fixed getByToken problem", "updated_at": "1422027117", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

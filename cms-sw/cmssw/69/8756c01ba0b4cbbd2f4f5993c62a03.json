These modules can be used for any possible comparisons using pixel tracks: CUDA CPU vs CUDA GPU, Alpaka Serial vs Alpaka Device and Alpaka vs CUDA (both Serial/CPU and Device/GPU). Old DQM compare modules for pixel rechits, tracks and vertices were removed. A new process modifier chain, `alpakaCUDAValidation`, was added to turn on both reconstructions and the Alpaka vs CUDA DQM modules when needed.\r\n\r\nA new workflow offset, `.405`, was added to run DQM with all the possible comparisons using pixel tracks objects. A new customization to run Alpaka vs CUDA comparisons in HLT was also created.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe modifications were tested using wfs `12434.403` (Alpaka validation), `12434.405` (Alpaka vs CUDA validation), and `12434.503` (CUDA validation). All comparisons follow the expectations.

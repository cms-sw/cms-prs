These modules can be used for any possible comparisons using pixel tracks: CUDA CPU vs CUDA GPU, Alpaka Serial vs Alpaka Device and Alpaka vs CUDA (both Serial/CPU and Device/GPU). A new process modifier chain, `alpakaCUDAValidation`, was added to turn on both reconstructions and the Alpaka vs CUDA DQM modules when needed.\r\n\r\nA new workflow offset, `.5041`, was added to run DQM with all the possible comparisons using pixel tracks objects. A new customization to run Alpaka vs CUDA comparisons in HLT was also created.\r\n\r\nThese changes will be back ported to CMSSW_14_0_X for the special validation of the Alpaka vs CUDA reconstruction.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe modifications were tested using wfs `12434.403` (Alpaka validation), `12434.5041` (Alpaka vs CUDA validation), and `12434.503` (CUDA validation). All comparisons follow the expectations.

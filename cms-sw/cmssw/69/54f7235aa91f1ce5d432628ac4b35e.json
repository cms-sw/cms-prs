A special test mode was constructed to emulate conditions of crash and find a fix.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1634319299", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1634248537", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["daq-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "aefd5fd648c1a94d78f0c42a59a117376c8b89f1", "merged_at": "1634319299", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "number": 35682, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "DAQ fix spurious luminosityBlockAuxiliary assertion in HLT (12_1_X)", "updated_at": "1634319299", "user": "smorovic"}

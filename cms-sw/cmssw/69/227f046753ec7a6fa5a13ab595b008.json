It is supposed to be addition of the components in 3 directions. The multiplication of y and z components was corrected to  momentum.x() * diff.x() + momentum.y() * diff.y() + momentum.z() * diff.z().\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nBuild test was successful without error. runTheMatrix had the 190 tests passed and 7 failed.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 4, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1769160260", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved", "tracking"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_1_X", "number": 49907, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Fix calculation in VertexDistance3D.cc", "updated_at": "1769169721", "user": "kaiekange"}

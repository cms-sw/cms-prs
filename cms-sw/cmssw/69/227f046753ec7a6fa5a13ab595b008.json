It is supposed to be addition of the components in 3 directions. The multiplication of y and z components was corrected to  momentum.x() * diff.x() + momentum.y() * diff.y() + momentum.z() * diff.z().\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nBuild test was successful without error. runTheMatrix had the 190 tests passed and 7 failed.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1769199337", "comments": 12, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1769160260", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved", "tracking"], "merge_commit_sha": "4bdbc06b47efc425ef914c167e81f914d79320e3", "merged_at": "1769199337", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_16_1_X", "number": 49907, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix calculation in VertexDistance3D.cc", "updated_at": "1769199338", "user": "kaiekange"}

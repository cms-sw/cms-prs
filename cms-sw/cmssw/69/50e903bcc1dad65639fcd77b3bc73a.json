This is based off of the idea raised in this [CMS-talk](https://cms-talk.web.cern.ch/t/pythia-filter-for-the-4-lepton-channel/41254?u=msrivast) post. Even though the post (and the branch name) imply that the filter is for the 4-lepton channel only, it can easily be used in other channels, as the only inputs are the PDG IDs of the particles you would like.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI've tested the filter to see that it does in fact only let through particles with the IDs that you specify, and that it will only allow events with particles that pass the pt and eta cuts which sum to a vector that has an invariant mass between the specified maximum and minimum values.", "branch": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "changed_files": 15923, "comments": 3, "commits": 10000, "created_at": "1719428487", "deletions": 957380, "labels": ["generators-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 45318, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "adding MCMultiParticleMassFilter", "updated_at": "1719581421", "user": "MohitS704"}

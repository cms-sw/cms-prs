If this is a problem then the calling\nmodule should pass in the full container and not a RefVector.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": "1422018913", "comments": 6, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1421961564", "deletions": 18, "labels": ["comparison-available", "new-package-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "2e7e569257f0dd8c97e7ddabe366ed799891a5e6", "merged_at": "1422018913", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 7333, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Do not call edm::RefVector<>::product in Associators", "updated_at": "1422027092", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

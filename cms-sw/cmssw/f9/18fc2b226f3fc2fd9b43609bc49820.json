CSV>0.7).\nIt uses a jet InputTag only to fill the TriggerFilterObjectWithRefs.\n\nHLTJetTagWithMatching is a filter that loop on a jet collection, and each jet is matched with the jetTag.\nIn this way it use the jet information from the jet collection, and the b-tag information by the jetTag collection.\n\nWith the new module, it will be possible, for instance, to have filter like \"at least one jet with pT>50 GeV and CSV>0.7\". In fact, you can produces a subset of jets and give it as InputTag to this module.\n\nSilvio.\n\"\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_3_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1421166576", "comments": 15, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1420735004", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "hlt-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "97840bbb3ceb1a9c1b1c8162a3d829b23e9adff8", "merged_at": "1421166576", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_3_X", "number": 7087, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Backport of HLTJetTagWithMatching in 73X (#6985)", "updated_at": "1421166576", "user": "silviodonato"}

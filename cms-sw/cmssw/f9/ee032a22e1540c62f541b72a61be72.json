Simply put, the testin for continuing to check for a merge was incorrect, and only ever looked at the first element. This effect was somewhat reduced since a relatively 'nice' ordering ordering of objects was guaranteed in the old version of PFBlockAlgo.\n\nThere is a ~2% effect on the background only in wf25202.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1397624818", "comments": 6, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1397565621", "deletions": 23, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "6b2528f6e35c88f72512dc012e30826261e79a4a", "merged_at": "1397624818", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_1_0_pre7", "number": 3348, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "PFEGamma bug fix : merging loop was terminating early", "updated_at": "1405495314", "user": "lgray"}

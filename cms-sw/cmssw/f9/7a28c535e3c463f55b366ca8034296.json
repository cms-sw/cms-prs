The `simCluster`s are splitted based on the sub detector / layer (for ETL) / module and on the requirement of having hits in adjacents rows / columns. The time associated to these clusters is the average of the hits' time weighted on the energy. These objects will be useful for the Mtd Validation, e.g. to optimize the clustering in the barrel. \r\n- `MtdSimTrackster`: these are created linking `MtdSimLayerCluster`s associated to the same `simTrack`. The time associated to these tracksters is the time of the first `simHit`. These objects will be useful within the TICL reconstruction to improve linking between MTD and HGCAL objects.\r\n\r\nIn addition, a new class `MTDGeomUtil` has been created to ease the process of obtaining hits position, layer, module, etc..\r\n\r\nThis follows the PR #41318 that had the consequence of more `simHit`s being saved in each `simCluster`.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nThe results have been checked on wf 20891.0, looking at single pions.\r\n\r\ncc: @fabiocos @felicepantaleo @waredjeb \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 27, "closed_at": "1687288572", "comments": 45, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1683921615", "deletions": 152, "labels": ["geometry-approved", "simulation-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "upgrade-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "84fc5ddd6396306c8bc92f7748e7edc2699f16a8", "merged_at": "1687288572", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_13_2_X", "number": 41662, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 56, "state": "closed", "title": "MC Truth information for MTD", "updated_at": "1687288573", "user": "AuroraPerego"}

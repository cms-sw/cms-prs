Since Chris Jones may be travelling, please bypass the L2 signature if not signed in a timely manner.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_ROOT6_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1426879633", "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1426878167", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "core-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "607f6d0b65c89a9e05175e3db59885148e991120", "merged_at": "1426879633", "merged_by": "davidlt", "number": 8444, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Redo fix for conddb v1", "updated_at": "1426880151", "user": "wmtan"}

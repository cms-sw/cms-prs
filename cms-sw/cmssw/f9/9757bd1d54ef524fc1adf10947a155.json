That's the point where the final candidate momentum turns to a NaN.\n\n@bachtis please check if fraction=0 makes sense in this case.\nIf confirmed, I'd run more tests and propagate to 75X/76X.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1445354561", "comments": 12, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1442438318", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "3d2113e99e8cbfe4d93f4101ebfc41e03e617be0", "merged_at": "1445354561", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 11302, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "pick ecal fraction of 0 for a candidate with trackMomentum 0", "updated_at": "1445354562", "user": "slava77"}

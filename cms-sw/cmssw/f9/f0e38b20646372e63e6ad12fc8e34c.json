This PR then allows to reuse GEN datasets in future for FastSim validation (few lines of code needed to be enable when datasets are available). \r\n- Adding MiniAOD validation (as in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/38736, but not merged yet)\r\n   - Few modifications on POG validation sequences are needed to support FastSim without HLT\r\n- Adding NanoAOD validation\r\n- Updating harvesting step to support FastSim, and get less complain on missing histograms\r\n\r\nThis PR can take over https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/38736\r\n\r\nExamples of DQM from this PR: https://tinyurl.com/2yb7zl22\r\n- MiniAOD and NanoAOD folders appears as expected. However, POG experts should check if something is missing.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n- There are warning from JetMET analyzer as it looks for HLT. I assume this is a task of JetMET to modify the code to accept NoHLT from FastSim.\r\n```\r\n%MSG-e HLTConfigProvider:   JetAnalyzer:jetDQMAnalyzerAk4PFCHSPuppiCleanedMiniAOD@streamBeginRun  23-Jul-2022 14:31:36 CEST Run: 1 Stream: 0\r\nFalling back to ProcessName-only init using ProcessName 'HLT' !\r\n```\r\n- This PR removes the following sequences from Tau validation sequence, to supprot FastSim/MC.

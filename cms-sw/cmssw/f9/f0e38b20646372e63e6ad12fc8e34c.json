I assume this is a task of JetMET to modify the code to accept NoHLT from FastSim.\r\n- This PR removes few sequence out from Tau validation sequence, to supprot FastSim/MC. This should be reviewed by Tau expert.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nRun the following configs our from `runTheMatrix` give expected results:\r\n`runTheMatrix.py --what upgrade -l 13234.0,13434.0,13240.303  -t 8 --wm init`\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

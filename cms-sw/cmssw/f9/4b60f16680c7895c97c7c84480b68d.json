While in the current geometry the size is constant for all cells, this implementation avoids hard-coding the size and is transparent w.r.t. geometry changes.\r\nThis feature is useful to study shower densities on truth level, and possibly for studying clustering algorithms.\r\n\r\nThe addition was discussed in the HGCAL DPG meeting: https://indico.cern.ch/event/1055901/ \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe code has been validated to produce the right sizes in eta and phi. It is also stable against wrong detID inputs.\r\nSince it implements a new feature, there are no downstream dependencies.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1625817840", "comments": 15, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1625726729", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "76b9b71296dc85c4412bd9858d01e040e2b3bc29", "merged_at": "1625817840", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "number": 34391, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "Added scintillator information to RecHitTools", "updated_at": "1625817840", "user": "jkiesele"}

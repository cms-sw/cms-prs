This yielded a `TestDQMOnlineClient` unit test failure reported in #38987.\r\nThese leftovers are dropped (and replaced by modifications of the newly-introduced `totemT2RawToDigi` sequence) in this PR. This fixes #38987.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n`scram b unittests` raises no failure in `TestDQMOnlineClient` unit test.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

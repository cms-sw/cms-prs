This ID is not supported anymore and we only noticed it during the preparation of the Fall17 V2 ID backport to 9_4_X. It is not enabled by default, that's why we didn't catch this in #24131.\r\n\r\nEven thought it's a deprecated ID, I think it's not appropriate to let it break in the 10_3_0 release in this ungraceful way, so I hope I'm still in time...\r\n\r\nMy personal validation workflow shows now agreement of the Spring15 photon MVAs between this PR and 9_4_9.\r\n\r\nJonas", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 7, "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1539933447", "deletions": 7, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-notrun", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-rejected"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_4_X", "number": 24937, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[10_4_X] Fixed copy-paste typo in Spring15 photon MVA weight file names", "updated_at": "1539953515", "user": "guitargeek"}

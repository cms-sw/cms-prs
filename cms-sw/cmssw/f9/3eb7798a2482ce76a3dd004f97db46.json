This is actually a valid input.\r\n\r\nFastCircle::isLine method is added to make the simple test.\r\n\r\nThere is no change to the physics results of the algorithms. A LogWarning is simply not issued anymore in the case that appears to already have a correct behavior.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_10_1_X", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 8, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1526633776", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["backport-ok", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_1_X", "number": 23242, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "reduce cases of LogWarnings with InvalidHelix category in Pixel/Strip ClusterShape compatibility checks", "updated_at": "1526727338", "user": "slava77"}

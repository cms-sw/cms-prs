Over 500 CMSSW macros do not compile in ROOT6. Since that is too many macros to be fixed centrally, it was decided by David Lange to centrally fix only those 45 macros with compilation errors that have been modified since the switch over to git, since those are the ones most likely to be used. A few of these 45 macros are in the Reconstruction L2 category. This pull request partially fixes the compilation errors. I could not fully fix RecoParticleFlow/PFClusterTools/test/src/testWrappers.C, because I could not find any place in CMSSW where type \"SingleParticleWrapper\" was declared. I chose not to fix RecoParticleFlow/PFClusterTools/test/src/clusterCalibrate.C because its only problem is that a constructor that it needs, pftools::PFClusterCalibration(pftools::IO *) has been commented out. Since it may have been commented out for a good reason, I left this alone. To fix this macro, simply uncomment the constructor.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1429030830", "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1429030799", "deletions": 15, "labels": [], "number": 8739, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Macros need to compile in ROOT6 (Reco) (7_4_X)", "updated_at": "1431368933", "user": "wmtan"}

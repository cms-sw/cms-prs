Here offsetRelativeSumPt parameter was introduced to allow better combine absolute and relative isolation. Say, you want to have absolute isolation <3GeV till 60GeV and above it relative <0.1/Pt. To do so, you need move the latter by 30GeV, ie apply cut as <0.1/(Pt-30). It is new configuration possibility which is not being used by any sequence run by default, so no changes are expected.\n\n@veelken, @mbluj\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_2_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1403602749", "comments": 7, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1403509962", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "e8a583dc6df360b55c0c599db991a7e8eccace8c", "merged_at": "1403602749", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_2_0_pre1", "number": 4347, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Adding offset parameter to the tau isolation", "updated_at": "1403605560", "user": "jpavel"}

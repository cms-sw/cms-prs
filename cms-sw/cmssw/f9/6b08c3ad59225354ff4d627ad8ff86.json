Theses classes are superseeded by TT\\* classes. \n\nAfter discussing with Louise, we agreed to clean them to ease the development of new features.\nThe code in SLHCUpgradeSimulations/L1TrackTrigger that uses these classes hasn't been touched for several years. These are old versions of what now lives in L1Trigger/TrackTrigger, so we think it is safe to remove it.\n\nThe modified code was tested with runTheMatrix.py --what upgrade -l 10800 and runTheMatrix.py --what upgrade -l 12200. Let's hope it was not picking deleted files from the release area.\n\n@boudoul, @skinnari, FYI.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_6_2_SLHCDEV_X", "changed_files": 58, "closed_at": "1454696241", "comments": 13, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1452794851", "deletions": 12630, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "geometry-pending", "l1-pending", "new-package-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "6ecc91bbc96ec6c36d987ecd8e30eec0808147cf", "merged_at": "1454696241", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_6_2_SLHCDEV_X", "number": 12954, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "L1 tkclasses cleaning", "updated_at": "1454696242", "user": "delaere"}

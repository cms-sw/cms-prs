This would lead to productGetter() returning a null value which was then used to attempt a function call. The code now only calls productGetter() once and handles the case where it was changed since the last check.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1434558420", "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1434482630", "deletions": 39, "labels": ["comparison-available", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "8db8f06e407b7cb698d34241fbc239c859f2c440", "merged_at": "1434558420", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 9648, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix a race condition in edm::Ref", "updated_at": "1439569890", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

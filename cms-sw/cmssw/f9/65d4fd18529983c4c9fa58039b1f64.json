E/gamma had asked for QCD b/c->E samples for upcoming Phase2 production. Without this fix, the electrons in those samples will be usable (meaningfully) only up to |eta|<2.5, which is not catastrophic, but if we can produce the MC samples with this fix in, then it would be better, because in that case electrons all the way up to |eta|=3 will be usable for the timing studies (MTD/HGCAL etc) that e/gamma plans to do.  \r\n\r\nSo, once this PR is merged, if possible kindly make a new 12_3_X release and we request to produce the samples using that new release. Again, if this is not possible for some reason, it's not a big problem for us. We can just restrict our phase2 timing studies to |eta|<2.5 range.

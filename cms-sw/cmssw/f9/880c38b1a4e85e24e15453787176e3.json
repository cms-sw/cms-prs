After double checking the GT those values were fine. I tracked it down to this line, which was removed already in 76X and 80X, but 75X was missed. This is necessary for both reference pp and PbPb MC production in 75X.\n\nTesting on a small local re-RECOed sample shows agreement again with the GT settings.\n\n@mandrenguyen @mulhearn you are interested in this.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1452008483", "comments": 27, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1450380999", "deletions": 13, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "f1c99fbab4e98749c7a6f3f8d9e4054a11f4aaeb", "merged_at": "1452008483", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 12820, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "stop overriding GT for CaloParams", "updated_at": "1452008483", "user": "richard-cms"}

These was similar fix for 6_2_X in accepted pull request done by Mark Grimes. This modification do the same thing but move TrackingParticleSelector.h to SimTracker/Common to reduce run time dependence of RECO from mixing module. runTheMatrix.py run is fine but dependences shoud be rechecked. \n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 18, "closed_at": "1380548657", "comments": 1, "commits": 13, "created_at": "1380548212", "deletions": 14, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "geometry-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_7_0_0_pre5", "number": 948, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Sim reco dependency", "updated_at": "1380549616", "user": "civanch"}

In principal these are the final changes (besides 1 more clean up pull request) but there will likely be further PRs to fix problems when I properly go through the validation.\n\nThis is on top of #7839 since it uses the eras added there.  #7841 is also in the queue but largely orthogonal to this, other than sharing #7839 as a base.  Until #7841 is merged you need to also use `run2` to fully configure an era though, e.g.\n\n```\n--era Run2_25ns,run2\n```\n\nOnce #7841 is merged one of `Run2_25ns`, `Run2_50ns` or `Run2_HI` will be sufficient.  However, I wouldn't recommend using the eras for real use until I've completed the validation.\nThe helper customisation function has also been removed, so there's no need to add that anymore.\n\nTo clarify, the roadmap for eras is now\n- #7839 to add support for 25ns, 50ns or HI eras.\n- #7841 to move the old `run2` era to `run2_common`.\n- one clean up pull request on top of #7841 to move the old `bunchspace25ns` to `run2_25ns_specific` (and the same for 50ns) - ready to go but holding off since the changes from #7841 will require loads of signatures.\n- This pull request to add the final changes and take out the helper function\n- Valdiation and pull requests for any fixes required.\n\n@fwyzard\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 15, "closed_at": "1424695768", "comments": 4, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1424349289", "deletions": 58, "labels": ["comparison-available", "daq-pending", "dqm-pending", "fastsim-approved", "l1-pending", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "f8474ab7777170cee7160bc09b7f4f58be1efc47", "merged_at": "1424695768", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 7860, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "Add L1 trigger changes to the Run 2 eras", "updated_at": "1424783080", "user": "mark-grimes"}

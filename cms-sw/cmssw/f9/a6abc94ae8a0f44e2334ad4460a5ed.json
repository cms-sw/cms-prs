Previously, each ME that contained a pattern in the configuration file was stored, leading to the storing of some unneeded MEs with overlapping names.\r\n\r\nMore information on the context of this PR can be found in this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VvDBvkMlKeJWKg9km30Kg3f1Lv3KB2HXE9Ne4HBbKLo/edit?usp=sharing) (note: under development, subject to change).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe modified selection and configuration was used to produce nanoDQMIO files locally. No issues were observed and the content of the nanoDQMIO file in terms of ME content is as expected. The usual runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos tests were run for the original PR to master.\r\n\r\n#### Backport\r\n\r\nThis is a backport of [PR40266](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/40266).\r\nIt is needed since we would use the updated nanoDQMIO configuration for the reprocessing of 2022 data.\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 7, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1670835484", "deletions": 74, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 40286, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[backport to 12_4_X] modify nanoDQMIO configuration", "updated_at": "1670916500", "user": "LukaLambrecht"}

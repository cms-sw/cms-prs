This in turn allows to freely change the parameters in order to optimize for efficiency / acceptance at the cost of increase of timing, as the ALCARECO will be run only on the `NoBPTX` dataset and not in dense events where the seeding and candidate building explodes.\r\n   *  thanks to the first point, the seeding and track building parameters have been optimized. Optimization has been done in order to increase the reconstruction efficiency of real interfill cosmics tracks undergoing the CDC reco.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe results of the parameter optimization have been presented [here](https://indico.cern.ch/event/879451/contributions/3873497/attachments/2045049/3425922/FollowUp_Cosmics_during_Collisions.pdf). The setup chosen here is corresponding to `TEST13`.\r\nDetailed timing studies on the various setups have been produced by @mtosi and are collected in this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1j4X3wbI6CbgSVHQKl8CU-ToU2gyZLaZcnT86hRR79uI/edit#gid=0).\r\n\r\nThis branch has also been technically tested by running the following command.\r\n```\r\ncmsDriver.py stepTest --conditions auto:run2_data -s RAW2DIGI,L1Reco,RECO,ALCA:TkAlCosmicsInCollisions --process reRECO --data --era Run2_2018 --eventcontent RECO,ALCARECO --scenario pp --datatier RECO,ALCARECO --customise Configuration/DataProcessing/RecoTLR.customisePostEra_Run2_2018 -n 10000 --dasquery='file dataset=/NoBPTX/Run2018B-v1/RAW site=T2_CH_CERN' --nThreads=8 --no_exec\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nThis PR is not a backport.\r\ncc:\r\n@mtosi, @connorpa @vbotta \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1592979808", "comments": 14, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1592232502", "deletions": 14, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "operations-approved", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "d3f6abb1559c8d4b05f6b52ae13760335273ae72", "merged_at": "1592979808", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 30248, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Move Cosmics During Collisions Reconstruction to ALCARECO ", "updated_at": "1592979809", "user": "mmusich"}

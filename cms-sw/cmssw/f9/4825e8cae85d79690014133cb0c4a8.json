A summary was given at the last MTD DPG meeting [1].\r\n\r\nThe MTD clusters associations maps are implemented in the following packages:\r\nSimDataFormats/Associations\r\nSimFastTiming/MtdAssociationProducers\r\nand used in the Validation/MtdValidation package.\r\n\r\nSome changes were made also to the following packages:\r\n- SimDataFormats/CaloAnalysis: addition of new members (positions_, idOffset_ ) and methods to the MtdSimCluster class. Class version updated accordingly.\r\n- SimGeneral/CaloAnalysis/plugins/MtdTruthAccumulator.cc updated to:  \r\n   1) produce all the MTD sim clusters, not only those from direct hits in the MTD, relying on the BTL sim hits categorization implemented by F. Cossutti in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/SimG4CMS/Forward/interface/MtdSD.h;   \r\n   2) store the local position of the MTD sim cluster estimated from the true position of the sim hits.\r\n- Geometry/MTDGeometryBuilder: added a new method to the MTDGeomUtil class to return the sensor module DetId starting from the crystal BTLDetId. \r\n\r\n[1] https://indico.cern.ch/event/1376660/#6-mtd-clusters-association-map\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nThe code was tested on the workflows:\r\n24807.0 (SingleMuPt10)\r\n24906.0 (SinglePiFlatPt0p7To10) \r\nand produces the expected results.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 35, "comments": 20, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1707393710", "deletions": 123, "labels": ["simulation-pending", "dqm-pending", "geometry-approved", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-approved", "mtd"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 43913, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 6, "state": "open", "title": "[MTD simulation, validation]: implementation of MTD clusters association maps", "updated_at": "1707863534", "user": "martinamalberti"}

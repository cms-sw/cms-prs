This change handles that case when replacing `.root` with `.rntpl`.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRan on the failing workflow. The file extensions are properly changed. The workflow still fails, for now, because RNTupleSource does not presently support reading more than one file. When that changes this PR will allow this workflow to run properly.", "branch": "CMSSW_15_1_RNTUPLE_X", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1749142804", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "tests-started", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "number": 48258, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Handle multi-file ALCA switch to RNTUPLE", "updated_at": "1749142826", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

It is a common method used in analyses with tau leptons. More information about tau embedding can be found in the paper: [https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-0221/14/06/P06032](https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-0221/14/06/P06032)  \r\nIn principle, one can split the method into 4 steps, but technically there are at least 6 steps that have to be executed.\r\n\r\nTo produce tau embedding samples, one can use the cmsDriver commands shown in this [presentation](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1508508/contributions/6347811/attachments/3007650/5301994/Christian_Winter_status_on_tau_embedding_2025_02_03.pdf#page=27).\r\n\r\nThe PR contains the following changes/commits:\r\n1. 41605d054ab24e6371c66aef001983773c4b4589 : copied folder [`TauAnalysis/MCEmbeddingTools`](https://github.com/KIT-CMS/cmssw/tree/master/TauAnalysis/MCEmbeddingTools) from master branch.

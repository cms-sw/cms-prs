This implementation will be used for the simulation of neutron background in the muon system. \r\nThe cavern geometry was updated with the following elements imported from fluka v3.0.0.0:\r\n- Electronics racks\r\n- HF risers\r\n- YB feet\r\n- realistic implementation of the cavern floor\r\n- elliptical cavern shape\r\n- cavern shaft \r\n@ianna fixed major overlaps. \nAutomatically ported from CMSSW_9_0_X #17674 (original by @amagnani).\nPlease wait for a new IB (12 to 24H) before requesting to test this PR.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 87, "closed_at": "1488961979", "comments": 17, "commits": 63, "created_at": "1488453933", "deletions": 3042, "labels": ["alca-pending", "analysis-pending", "comparison-pending", "dqm-pending", "geometry-pending", "hlt-pending", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-rejected", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending", "upgrade-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_9_1_X", "number": 17689, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "2017 Dev Scenario with Detailed Cavern", "updated_at": "1488961979", "user": "cmsbuild"}

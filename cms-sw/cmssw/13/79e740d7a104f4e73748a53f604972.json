The crash is due to the invalid station assignment and this PR fixes it. \r\n\r\nSince we want to keep this firmware for the next MWGR we want to get this in CMSSW as soon as possible also with a backport to 11_3_X.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with a description of the feature proposed or problem addressed, specifying:\r\n  - what changes are expected in the output if any, \r\n  - what other PRs or externals it depends upon if any,\r\n  - link to any additional material useful to provide a documentation for this PR (slides, JIRA tickets, related pull requestes, hypernews, TWiki or Indico pages)  -->\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nValidated with:\r\n\r\n- scram b runtests\r\n- runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with a description of which tests have been performed to verify the correctness of the PR, including the eventual addition of new code for testing like unit tests, test configurations, additions or updates to the runTheMatrix test workflows -->\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nThis is a backport of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/33808.\r\n\r\nFYI: @jiafulow @dildick @silviodonato \r\n\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1621850997", "comments": 7, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1621598855", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["bug-fix", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "bef7b118c5c771804d1c3a67852ad8377aa96699", "merged_at": "1621850997", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 33811, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix EMTF unpacker crash by changing GEM station assignment [11_3_X]", "updated_at": "1621850997", "user": "eyigitba"}

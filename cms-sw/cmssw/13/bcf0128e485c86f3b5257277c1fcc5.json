The dataformats are content-agnostic, so we don't expect them to evolve much in the future.\r\n\r\nSome other generic classes may be relocated to `PhysicsTools/PatAlgos`.\r\n\r\nIntegration with **cmsDriver & runTheMatrix** is not yet included in this PR, but we probably want to define:\r\n* one new step for NanoAOD (`NANO` ?)\r\n* one new data tier and event content for NanoAOD (`NANOAOD`, `NANOAODSIM`?); we may have to define it for both the full EDM and the nano format, which have the same event content but differ in the output module used (`PoolOuputModule` vs `NanoAODOutputModule`), **advice on how to do this is welcome.**\r\n* one set of matrix workflows testing NanoAOD production out of a bunch of different data & mc files to check the event size, and do simple validation, and possibly two extra workflows for joint RECO+MINIAOD+NANOAOD (T0) & MINIAOD+NANOAOD (MC).\r\n\r\n@arizzi @peruzzim @emanueledimarco \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 73, "closed_at": "1506069568", "comments": 20, "commits": 15, "created_at": "1505741244", "deletions": 30, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "new-package-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_9_4_X", "number": 20563, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "NanoAOD prototype [RFC]", "updated_at": "1506515584", "user": "gpetruc"}

Someone must have noticed for sure if this \"split mode\" is relevant.\r\n\r\nAnd indeed the \"split mode\" code path of the `TagAndProbeFitter` is disabled by default and not enabled in any Python config file. So it seems that this code is seemingly not used and should be removed for cleanup/bugfix/simplification.\r\n\r\nAlternative to #47388.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1739892582", "deletions": 204, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 47389, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Remove split mode code path from TagProbeFitter", "updated_at": "1739892757", "user": "guitargeek"}

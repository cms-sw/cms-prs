[valDB report](https://hypernews.cern.ch/HyperNews/CMS/get/relval/13837/3/1.html) ).\r\nThis PR fixes the premixing case.  \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nPR validation has been carried out by @tsusa by comparing the pixel valid hit occupancy maps in the baseline CMSSW_11_0_X branch for premixing with and without this PR and compared with classical mixing (tested earlier to work correctly).\r\nI report here one example for BPix Layer 1:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5082376/64092106-a5412380-cd53-11e9-9d97-cb9305dc3868.png)\r\n\r\nmore information is contained in this [presentation](https://cernbox.cern.ch/index.php/s/V8XrBlPMsMbk8iv).\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\n\r\nbackport of #27912\r\n\r\ncc:\r\n@tsusa @veszpv @tvami \r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1568892167", "comments": 10, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1567410354", "deletions": 8, "labels": ["backport-ok", "bug-fix", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "3e9ea982443b1d3e68c962260144f35b62a56d92", "merged_at": "1568892167", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 27916, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "[10.6.X] Fix simulation of the pixel bad components on the FED channel basis for PreMixing", "updated_at": "1568892168", "user": "mmusich"}

This is extremely intrusive and breaks encapsulation.\n\nThis does not work anymore with new libstdc++ libraries, because foward\ndelcaration of struct is implicitly private and then implementation is\nunder explicit private clause. Redefining 'private' only change one of\nthem thus creating compile-time errors in sstream.\n\nDetails in PR65899 (GCC BZ). It's WONTFIX.\n\nSuch cleanups are required for GCC 5 and above\n\nSigned-off-by: David Abdurachmanov David.Abdurachmanov@cern.ch\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1444056414", "comments": 12, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1443697719", "deletions": 99, "labels": ["alca-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "8c5c99ac7fe32f36aad42fbf19f663ab4b8ca690", "merged_at": "1444056414", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 11591, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "CondCore/DBCommon: remove intrusive macros breaking libstdc++", "updated_at": "1444056415", "user": "davidlt"}

For some strange reason when header checks are run without optimization flags (`-O2`). In past we had noticed that there were a lot of Internal Compilr Errors (ICE) for header checks when optimization flags are used that is why we have dropped the use of `-O*` for checker checks but now with GCC9 few files failed if optimization flags are not passed. \r\n\r\nThis change allows to explicitly pass extra flags to header checks.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1606495802", "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1606460206", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-notrun", "hold", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "requires-external", "tests-rejected"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 32308, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "[HeaderConsistency] set -O2 flag for header checks", "updated_at": "1606495806", "user": "smuzaffar"}

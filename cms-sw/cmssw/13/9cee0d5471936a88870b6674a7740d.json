Quoting the description of the original PR\r\n\r\n> Profiling https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/38725 in https://mkortela.web.cern.ch/mkortela/cgi-bin/navigator/issue38725/hlt_ConditionalTask_06_perf/12 showed that a lot of time in an HLT job was spent in `edm::ParameterSet::getParameter<edm::ParameterSet>()` and `edm::detail::processEDAliases()`. These seemed to be caused by the processing of EDAliases and SwitchProducers for ConditionalTasks being repeated for all the Paths of the HLT menu (e.g. the SwitchProducer loop has N(paths) x N(modules)  overall complexity).\r\n> \r\n> This PR attempts to speed up the job startup time by processing the EDAliases and SwitchProducers for ConditionalTasks only once for all Paths, leading to > 10x improvement in the `StreamSchedule` constructor\r\n> https://mkortela.web.cern.ch/mkortela/cgi-bin/navigator/issue38725/hlt_ConditionalTask_36_perf/12\r\n> bringing the time close to what it would be if the HLT menu would use Tasks instead of ConditionalTasks\r\n> https://mkortela.web.cern.ch/mkortela/cgi-bin/navigator/issue38725/hlt_Task_06_perf/12\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nFramework unit tests pass.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

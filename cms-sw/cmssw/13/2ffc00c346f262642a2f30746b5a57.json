It affects the phase2 work flows with the following versions of the Tracker geometry: T5, T6, T7, T8, T9, T10. At the moment there is no evidence of x-talk in other pixel sizes. The work has been presented in Tracker Phase2 Simulation Meeting [*\r\n\r\n[*]https://indico.cern.ch/event/768246/contributions/3199413/attachments/1746858/2828470/CMSSW_inter-pixel_cross-talk.pdf\r\n\r\n\r\n@emiglior \r\n@ajofrehe \r\n@Arash-Jofrehei ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 9, "comments": 0, "commits": 10, "created_at": "1541509935", "deletions": 52, "labels": [], "number": 25134, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Implementation of realising XTalk for Inner Pixel detector (IT)", "updated_at": "1541509935", "user": "suchandradutta"}

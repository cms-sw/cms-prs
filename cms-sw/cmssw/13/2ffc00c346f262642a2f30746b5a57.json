It affects the phase2 work flows with the following versions of the Tracker geometry: T5, T6, T7, T8, T9, T10. At the moment there is no evidence of x-talk in other pixel sizes. The work has been presented in Tracker Phase2 Simulation Meeting [*\r\n\r\n[*]https://indico.cern.ch/event/768246/contributions/3199413/attachments/1746858/2828470/CMSSW_inter-pixel_cross-talk.pdf\r\n\r\n\r\n@emiglior \r\n@ajofrehe \r\n@Arash-Jofrehei ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 9, "closed_at": "1541838961", "comments": 24, "commits": 11, "created_at": "1541509935", "deletions": 52, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "e5e7efdda24f0846841385f4223811801924f029", "merged_at": "1541838961", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_4_X", "number": 25134, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 10, "state": "closed", "title": "Implementation of realising XTalk for Inner Pixel detector (IT)", "updated_at": "1541838961", "user": "suchandradutta"}

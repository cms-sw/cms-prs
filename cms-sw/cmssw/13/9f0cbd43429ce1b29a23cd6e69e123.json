At least 2 bits in the ALCT->(O)TMB data stream and at least 1 bit in the (O)TMB->EMTF data stream can be repurposed for such exotic objects. We will reassign the unused synchronization error (`syncErr`) data word in the LCT. No changes are expected. The bit values have yet to be finalized and implemented.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested with WF 20434.0. \r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nN/A", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 9, "closed_at": "1586840996", "comments": 15, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1584659745", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "8fe789ca05c78083fac5f4350306d6c822ce3d36", "merged_at": "1586840996", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 29247, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Interface for high multiplicity triggers in CSC", "updated_at": "1586840996", "user": "dildick"}

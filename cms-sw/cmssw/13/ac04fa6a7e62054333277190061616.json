This is extremely intrusive and breaks encapsulation.\n\nThis does not work anymore with new libstdc++ libraries, because foward\ndelcaration of struct is implicitly private and then implementation is\nunder explicit private clause. Redefining 'private' only change one of\nthem thus creating compile-time errors in sstream.\n\nDetails in PR65899 (GCC BZ). It's WONTFIX.\n\nSuch cleanups are required for GCC 5 and above.\n\nSigned-off-by: David Abdurachmanov David.Abdurachmanov@cern.ch\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1445925100", "comments": 12, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1445840414", "deletions": 53, "labels": ["comparison-available", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "90c09d02d816cc9b20ad47ba91cf75c76ea1ba62", "merged_at": "1445925100", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 12092, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "FWCore/Utilities: remove intrusive macros breaking libstdc++", "updated_at": "1445925101", "user": "davidlt"}

Now it should at least be possible to generate the needed configuration. More changes might be needed once we actually try it out on the Tier0 (apparently we never run PCL in cosmics scenario before). Might be useful for future cosmics runs.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_5_3_X", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": "1383676315", "comments": 5, "commits": 8, "created_at": "1383312933", "deletions": 10, "labels": ["core-pending", "operations-approved", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "23e3b02cf0939b279802221558f548da06a05543", "merged_at": "1383676315", "merged_by": "smuzaffar", "milestone": "CMSSW_5_3_X", "number": 1282, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Pcl for cosmics", "updated_at": "1383676315", "user": "cerminar"}

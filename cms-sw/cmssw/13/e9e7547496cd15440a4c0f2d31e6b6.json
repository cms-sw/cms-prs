This map is currently filled in on demand, which means that the registry could be modified during any event, a problem for the multithreaded framework.\nThis pull request changes this so that an entry is inserted into the map when a process history is registered.  This means that the map will no longer, by itself, be a thread safety issue.  The ProcessHistoryRegistry as a whole is still an issue.\nThe changes outside the framework are the minimal adaptations to this framework change.\nThis request also makes C++ improvements to some of the framework fies that were modified anyway, particularly IndexIntoFIle.cc.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 24, "closed_at": "1377639801", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1377269785", "deletions": 215, "labels": ["core-approved", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "generators-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_7_0_0_pre4", "number": 598, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add process history map entry immediately on registration", "updated_at": "1406900894", "user": "wmtan"}

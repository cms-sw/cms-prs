In addition, GEN directory contains ISR/FSR up/down (2 or 1/2) variations and their ratio to the nominal, while LHE directory contains envelop of scale variations and PDF uncertainty ( RMS) and their ratio to the nominal. Assumed 9 scale variations & 103 PDF variations, which should hold for most of the cases.\r\n\r\nDemo of Relval plots with workflow 556 (TTbar Powheg+Pythia8) would look like [this](https://sako.web.cern.ch/Validation/wgtValDemo_v2/TTbarPow/Generator.html).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested with following GEN workflows:\r\n* 504 (QCD Pt-30 Pythia8) - no LHE or GEN weight\r\n* 555 (DY+jets aMCatNLO+Pythia8) - has LHE but no GEN (PS) weight\r\n* 556 (TTbar Powheg+Pythia8) - has both LHE & GEN weights\r\n\r\nas the routine will run for all GEN workflows, there should be no exception regardless of having LHE products or not.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 14, "comments": 32, "commits": 12, "created_at": "1645113810", "deletions": 113, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "generators-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 36994, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 17, "state": "open", "title": "Add GEN/LHE weight validation subdirectories for GEN Relval", "updated_at": "1646651086", "user": "SanghyunKo"}

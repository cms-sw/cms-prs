For the time being, the GT uses the MC conditions for both data and MC, so no change is expected wrt the previous one (python configuration with MC conditions)\n\n2) re-introduction of the spike killing flags, kOutOfTime and kWeird. The cuts for the topological variables have been reoptimised. If those flags are used in the PF rechits, there could be some minimal change wrt previous version. \n\n3) autocond files contain the GTs with the payloads (there should be the same commit by Salvatore @diguida on the AlCa DB side).\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 12, "closed_at": "1422988375", "comments": 3, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1422987437", "deletions": 149, "labels": ["alca-pending", "comparison-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 7543, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Ecalmultifit use DB inputs and retuning of spike flagging", "updated_at": "1423131163", "user": "emanueledimarco"}

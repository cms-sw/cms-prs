The workflows also use the proper Phase 2 pulse shape obtained from 2018 TB data.\r\nThe `EcalLazyClusterTools` were updated to make an EE input collection optional.\r\nECAL DQM tasks and clients not needed for Phase 2 are removed from the workflow. This is not the final setup. Some tasks may be added or modified at a later time when the required inputs become available.\r\n\r\nNo changes are expected for Run 3 workflows. Phase 2 workflows could have several endcap and preshower DQM and validation plots removed but the barrel ones should not be affected.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nPasses limited matrix tests (except some file open errors) as well as WFs 34034.0 and ECAL Phase 2 development workflows 34034.61 and 34034.612.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 38, "comments": 7, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1763485160", "deletions": 657, "labels": ["simulation-pending", "dqm-pending", "operations-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "code-checks-approved", "ecal"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_0_X", "number": 49409, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "ECAL Phase 2 - Upgrades for Phase 2 development workflow, validation and DQM", "updated_at": "1763538698", "user": "thomreis"}

So that was fixed (in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/44592) as soon as the issue was spotted. However, the unseeded paths are also part of CMSSW so it's a good idea to not leave them with known issues. So, the unseeded paths' ordering is being fixed in this PR. \r\n\r\nIn Run2/Run3 it was common to use a mix of seeded and unseeded paths/legs. Specially, for multi-EG paths, it is rather common to use one seeded leg and keep others unseeded. Unseeded reco has higher efficiency, but also higher resource/timing cost. Depending on how CPU/GPU timing evolves for phase2 menu over next months/years, the same strategy (ie use both seeded and unseeded as necessary) can be done in phase2 HLT. So, the unseeded paths might become part of realistic menu some day, although now they are not.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nPhase 2 HLT menu runs.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 12, "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1714036667", "deletions": 192, "labels": ["hlt-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 44849, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Fix ordering of egamma HLT modules in unseeded paths", "updated_at": "1714036694", "user": "swagata87"}

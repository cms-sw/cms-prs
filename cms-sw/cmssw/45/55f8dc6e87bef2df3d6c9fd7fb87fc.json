Maybe we don't want to use them anymore? I removed a big chunk of them from the code, refactoring a bit on the way.\r\n\r\nIt was really interesting since I learned how to use `std::bind`, `std::function` and the lambda expressions in practice.\r\n\r\nLocal matrix tests pass, there should be absolutely no difference in reconstruction.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 144, "comments": 22, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1536948894", "deletions": 1519, "labels": ["alca-pending", "analysis-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "core-pending", "db-pending", "dqm-pending", "fastsim-pending", "geometry-pending", "l1-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-started", "upgrade-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_3_X", "number": 24549, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 11, "state": "open", "title": "Removed many unary_/binary_functions", "updated_at": "1537188701", "user": "guitargeek"}

Maybe we don't want to use them anymore? I removed a big chunk of them from the code, refactoring a bit on the way.\r\n\r\nIt was really interesting since I learned how to use `std::bind`, `std::function` and the lambda expressions in practice.\r\n\r\nLocal matrix tests pass, there should be absolutely no difference in reconstruction.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 118, "closed_at": "1539238748", "comments": 88, "commits": 13, "created_at": "1536948894", "deletions": 1559, "labels": ["alca-approved", "analysis-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "core-approved", "db-approved", "dqm-approved", "fastsim-approved", "geometry-approved", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "cd82ddeb9e2bb0977bd8754bb0f57a2e2d93dd22", "merged_at": "1539238748", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_4_X", "number": 24549, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 67, "state": "closed", "title": "Removed many unary_/binary_functions", "updated_at": "1539238757", "user": "guitargeek"}

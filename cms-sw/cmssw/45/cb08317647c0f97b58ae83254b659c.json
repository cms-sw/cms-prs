Both of them include a subdirectory standalone/ where code that is not needed for operation within CMSSW was collected. However, some of this code will need to be reactivated for CMSSW as it produces auto-generated code that describes Phase1 geometry and mkFit track-finding parameters.\r\n\r\n```\r\nRecoTracker\r\n|-- MkFit\t\tCMSSW mkFit producers, ESs; unchanged, just include directives are fixed\r\n|   |-- interface\r\n|   |-- plugins\r\n|   |-- python\r\n|   |-- src\r\n|\r\n|-- MkFitCMS\t\tcontains CMS specific steering code, algos & configuration:\r\n|   |-- interface\t  - geometry, layers, iterations\r\n|   |-- src\t\t  - scoring, seed cleaning, duplicate removal functions\r\n|   `-- standalone\tcode to create: \r\n|       |-- CMS-2017\t  .

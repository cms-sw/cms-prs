People try to code in C++, but with C in mind. They want to return a const reference, but reference must point to a valid object, there is no such thing as null reference (not allowed by standard). To overcome the issue people started to define dummy statics inside the functions and return a reference to the dummy. It's wrong. The function should return a pointer and callee should return `nullptr` if needed. The caller cannot even handle situation if it gets a reference, it doesn't know if returned reference is valid or not.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1385304021", "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1384943238", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["alca-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "f3b972de5667c458845ab14e6e17864e6804c6ec", "merged_at": "1385304021", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_0_0_pre9", "number": 1532, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Make static a const in SiStripFecCabling::fecs()", "updated_at": "1385304071", "user": "davidlt"}

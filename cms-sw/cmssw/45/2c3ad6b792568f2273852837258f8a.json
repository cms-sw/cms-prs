This bug incorrectly deposited energy values close to the BSM particles mass into the simulated detector. This merge request reverts the energy deposit model to a previously working version from 2015. **This is a work in progress, additional changes are expected to be made.** [Here are slides given to the EXO general group on the topic from November 19th, 2024](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1479107/)\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n`scram b runtests use-ibeos` completed successfully.\r\n`runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos` completed successfully without any failrues.\r\nBelow is a comparison of 10,000 identically seeded simulated energy deposits in the ECAL barrel with and without the bug.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"681\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-11-18 at 1 51 38PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a7ccf83-9da9-429a-b8e5-5893ef33296a\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"679\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-11-18 at 1 52 19PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ddd919a-1173-4b32-b872-d932bad5ac38\">\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1732174718", "comments": 12, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1731952434", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["simulation-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "92333e3acb2db4776c5772fbd71e3ef325a9b46e", "merged_at": "1732174718", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_14_2_X", "number": 46728, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fixed energy of R-Hadron cloud in energy deposit model", "updated_at": "1732174770", "user": "ctdax"}

This is relevant since the constituent subtraction is particle-by-particle subtraction and therefore produces a new set of PF candidates.\r\n2. added the production of background estimates (HiFJRhoProducer) to the heavy ion reconstruction.\r\n3. CS algo is run with the fastjet contrib package. pT and mass of ghosts is assigned in the CSJetProducer\r\n4. The Cs jet production for R=0.3 and R=0.4 is added to the standard heavy ion workflow.\r\n\r\nThe PR was tested on wf 140.53 and 145\r\n\r\nA report on this method in heavy ion collision at the JMAR meeting can be found here:\r\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/502737/contributions/2012693/attachments/1237496/1817780/160302_ConstituentSubtraction.pdf\r\n\r\n@rappoccio @mandrenguyen @cfmcginn @kurtejung @ahinzmann @knash", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1500535845", "comments": 47, "commits": 9, "created_at": "1499161006", "deletions": 41, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "d4567c9854d096f337b7e8321dd1aee9850114cc", "merged_at": "1500535845", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_3_X", "number": 19537, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 14, "state": "closed", "title": "Integration of constituent subtracted jets into heavy ion reconstruction", "updated_at": "1500535845", "user": "mverwe"}

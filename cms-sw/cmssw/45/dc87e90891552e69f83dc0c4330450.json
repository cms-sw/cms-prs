In current nanoAOD, PV_score which is the sum pt2 of clustered objects, shows worse performance (~7% relatively more DY events will surviving the selection) than SumPT2.  So, we propose to add the PV  SumPT2 in the nanoAOD.\r\n\r\nSince only 1 variable (float type) for each event is proposed to add, the expected additional size in nanoAOD will be 1 to 2 bytes per event, depending on the precision to store this variable (8 or 10 bits). By default we propose to store it in the precision with 10 bits.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nrunTheMatrix tests have been successfully run for the following workflow :\r\n\trunTheMatrix.py -l 12434.0\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Backport:\r\n\r\nWe target this to go in Nano V13 for now. Backport might be required if the Nano production happens in the earlier CMSSW release.\r\n\r\nHgg convenors @lfinco , @fcouderc\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 24, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1701693097", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "xpog-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "number": 43487, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 5, "state": "open", "title": "Add PV sumPT2 of pf charged particles associated to PV in NanoAOD ", "updated_at": "1704881615", "user": "JunquanTao"}

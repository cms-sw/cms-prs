That bug fix should only affect code run in SubProcesses so it shouldn't do any harm because it is usually not executed. If it did actually get run, then the bug fix is probably needed).", "branch": "CMSSW_9_2_X", "changed_files": 23, "closed_at": "1499617683", "comments": 12, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1499366080", "deletions": 234, "labels": ["comparison-available", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "tests-rejected"], "merge_commit_sha": "1b62efccb14d20e82c825c9e30b6a93707b133ae", "merged_at": "1499617683", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_2_X", "number": 19600, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Back port feature allowing special value @currentProcess for InputTag process name", "updated_at": "1511977887", "user": "wddgit"}

This would be a big step for the egamma code cleanup. Other producers would not have to support the old workflow anymore (which can result in a good reduction of the number of configuration parameters) helpers that were only used by the old producers can be removed, etc.\r\n\r\nStill, this cleanup is not completely trivial because there is a whole relval-step (`RECODFROMRAWRECO`) which still depends on the old sequences. I am not completely familiar with these relval-steps so maybe I'm doing a mistake by proposing also the removal of this step, but it seems to me that the step is not supported anymore anyway: in the MatrixReader, it's hardcoded that this step is ignored [1,2], and the word `RECODFROMRAWRECO` appears nowhere else in CMSSW. The other remaining use of the old gsfElectronSequence was in the `cosmicElectronSequence`. However, this is not used anywhere: the cosmic reconstruction uses only the `egammarecoCosmics_woElectrons` sequence.\r\n\r\n@Sam-Harper, @jainshilpi, @lsoffi, please let us know if you think if this is a good idea or if you  think the old GsfElectronProducer should still stick around. I think this is a very good opportunity to reduce quite a bit the complexity of the egamma reco area and hence render it easier to understand and to work with.\r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/Configuration/PyReleaseValidation/python/MatrixReader.py#L243\r\n[2] https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/Configuration/PyReleaseValidation/python/MatrixReader.py#L341\r\n[3] https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/Configuration/StandardSequences/python/ReconstructionCosmics_cff.py#L59\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCMSSW compiles and local matrix tests pass.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\n\r\nNo backport intended.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 20, "closed_at": "1578646392", "comments": 67, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1574223459", "deletions": 749, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "operations-approved", "orp-approved", "pdmv-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "8b4e1920d457d54d0e150b0882dd8f9c8d97472f", "merged_at": "1578646392", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 28429, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 9, "state": "closed", "title": "Phase out old pre-GED GsfElectron sequence", "updated_at": "1578646392", "user": "guitargeek"}

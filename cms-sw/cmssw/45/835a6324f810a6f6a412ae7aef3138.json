Due to the way the plots axis are automatically named in the PixelPhase1 framework, this update should be partnered with a DQMGUI update.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1496808473", "comments": 8, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1496316059", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "378ea5652011d9ad411874a53fb7f954c6467534", "merged_at": "1496808473", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_2_X", "number": 19061, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "FED Digis trend plot fix", "updated_at": "1496808473", "user": "yimuchen"}

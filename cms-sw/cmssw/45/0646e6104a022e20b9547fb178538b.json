This fix was pending for long and now a good time to implement.\r\n2) FTFP_BERT_EMY physics list provide crashes in CMS geometry, which were recently understood and more safe parameters for Geant4 tracking are proposed\r\n3) Custom physics configuration historically have parameters , which are not used, so they are removed\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nprivate\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\n\r\nBefore submitting your pull requests, make sure you followed this checklist:\r\n- verify that the PR is really intended for the chosen branch\r\n- verify that changes follow [CMS Naming, Coding, And Style Rules](http://cms-sw.github.io/cms_coding_rules.html)\r\n- verify that the PR passes the basic test procedure suggested in the [CMSSW PR instructions](https://cms-sw.github.io/PRWorkflow.html)\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1574194189", "comments": 14, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1574089426", "deletions": 17, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "1df7d8c9bd17a02723904bcd5bac875e5fe00cc1", "merged_at": "1574194189", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 28416, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Clean-up Geant4 Physics Lists", "updated_at": "1574194189", "user": "civanch"}

After merging with the head of CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC these are the only files with changes however.\n\nNote that I haven't tested anything yet - I'll do that through this pull request and comment here.  #2785 should be closed.\n\n@sviret please check this request.  It should be everything you wanted without any changes to other packages.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "changed_files": 11, "closed_at": "1395239312", "comments": 5, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1395157279", "deletions": 201, "labels": ["fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-pending", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "a5733ee8a8af9a0fde1ff833a59c68bee2d634d5", "merged_at": "1395239312", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "number": 2913, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Rebase of pull request #2785", "updated_at": "1396865614", "user": "mark-grimes"}

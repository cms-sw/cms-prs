This PR also addresses a question that was asked a while ago [here](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/25685#issuecomment-458535838). I should note that these `ME0TriggerDigi` can also be used in the Phase-2 EMTF in the near future.\r\n\r\nI did rename the configuration from `me0TriggerPseudoDigis_cfi` to `me0TriggerConvertedPseudoDigis_cfi`, otherwise `me0TriggerPseudoDigis_cfi` would clash with modules defined in `me0TriggerPseudoDigis_cff`. (The new objects are in fact converted ME0Segments.) I also added the standard `me0RecHits` and `me0Segments` modules in the sequence so that `me0TriggerConvertedPseudoDigis` has all the required inputs.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI ran matrix test 20434.0 to check that the triggers are produced and saved in the event content. That is indeed the case as you can see below. The new `Converted` pseudo digis are of type `ME0TriggerDigi` in contrast to `me0TriggerPseudoDigis` which is of type `ME0Segment`.\r\n\r\n```\r\n-bash-4.2$ edmEventSize -a -v step2.root | grep me0Trigger\r\nME0DetIdME0SegmentsOwnedRangeMap_me0TriggerPseudoDigis__HLT. 1299 666\r\nME0DetIdME0TriggerDigiMuonDigiCollection_me0TriggerConvertedPseudoDigis__HLT. 495.6 328.2\r\n```\r\n\r\nFYI: @tahuang1991 @mmaggi", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1573071964", "comments": 17, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1571170352", "deletions": 30, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "4e78e085db52d16969b34658b15c4a2874d7e8ae", "merged_at": "1573071964", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 28183, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "Enable ME0TriggerPseudoDigiProducer in Phase-2 L1T sequence", "updated_at": "1573071964", "user": "dildick"}

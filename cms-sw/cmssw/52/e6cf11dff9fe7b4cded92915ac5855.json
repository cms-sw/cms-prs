Specifically, one of the modules in the sequence filters based on a set of trigger expressions that are normally present in the pp menu but are missing from the `LumiScan` menu. This caused the DQM client to crash during run 394413 (see [log](https://cmsweb.cern.ch/dqm/dqm-square/api/get_logs?id=dqm-source-state-run394413-hostdqmfu-c2b03-45-01-pid3452657&db=production) for details).\r\n\r\nThe online DQM team applied a patch to the DQM online client last, so the online side is now functioning correctly. However, the same sequence is also used in the Prompt reconstruction for `ScoutingPFMonitor`, so we expect that all runs acquired with the `LumiScan` menu will also crash.\r\n\r\n*PS*:\r\nPreparing a patch release for Tier0 in time for the impending prompt of fill [10821](https://cmsoms.cern.ch/cms/fills/report?cms_fill=10821) seems impractical. As a temporary workaround, we suggested the ORM @mpresill asking Tier-0 to remove the `@hltScouting` DQM sequence from the\r\n \r\n `\"dqm_seq\": \"@common,@hltScouting\"` \r\n \r\n of the `ScoutingPFMonitor` Prompt Reconstruction configuration.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nExecuted the `scouting_dqm_sourceclient-live_cfg.py` using data from run 394413 (kindly collected by @nothingface0) using:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncmsRun scouting_dqm_sourceclient-live_cfg.py runInputDir=/eos/user/d/dpapagia/data runNumber=394413 scanOnce=True\r\n```\r\n\r\nwithout issues.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

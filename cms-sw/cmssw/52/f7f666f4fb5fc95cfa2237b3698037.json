In addition, it cleans up `classes.h` file. ~~, and marks the `MiniFloatConverter::ReduceMantissaToNbitsRounding` as transient (since its persistency was clearly no the intention in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/42323)~~ (this class does not need to marked as transient because it is not an instantiation of `edm::Wrapper<T>` template, and `persistent=\"false\"` would have zero impact)\r\n\r\nResolves https://github.com/cms-sw/framework-team/issues/977\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles. The generated `.rootmap` files are nearly identical. This PR adds\r\n```\r\nclass vector<std::pair<ROOT::Math::PositionVector3D<ROOT::Math::Cartesian3D<double>,ROOT::Math::DefaultCoordinateSystemTag>,float> >\r\n``` \r\nthere (there already was a  nearly identical `vector<pair<...`).\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1722872414", "comments": 11, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1722528557", "deletions": 295, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "64834b59171cbdf04ec929ed62b1ef5c3e1b6d8b", "merged_at": "1722872414", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 45620, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Replace patterns with explicit class names in `DataFormats/Math/src/classes_def.xml`", "updated_at": "1722872415", "user": "makortel"}

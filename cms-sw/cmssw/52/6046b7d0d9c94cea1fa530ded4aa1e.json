The user will specify one of `Run2_25ns`, `Run2_50ns` or `Run2_HI` (as discussed in the 17th Feb ORP) but these are actually chains of the new modifiers created here.\n\nI also changed the way cmsDriver checks whether one of the eras specified is one of the internal use sub-eras, so that it can warn the user.\n\n**I propose getting rid of the eras `run2`, `bunchspacing25ns` and `bunchspacing50ns`**, but this isn't done in this pull request.  Everything so far configured as `run2` will be changed to `run2_common` which is added here, then `run2` removed.  This will be a big (but simple) change in many packages so I wanted this idea reviewed here first.  The bunchspacing ones will be changed to `run2_25ns_specific` or `run2_50ns_specific` then removed.\n\nCurrent road map for eras is a bit different to that discussed in the 17th Feb ORP:\n- This pull request\n- Change all `run2` modifications to `run2_common` and remove `run2` [EDIT implemented in #7841]\n- L1 trigger changes (the 1 pull request mentioned in the ORP) [EDIT implemented in #7860]\n- potentially another L1T for FastSim pull request, once I get an answer to a question\n- Validation, then any pull requests to fix errors found\n\n@fwyzard, you asked to be kept informed\n@Dr15Jones, in case you have any comments on the choice of chaining\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1424377784", "comments": 5, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1424263657", "deletions": 10, "labels": ["comparison-available", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "fa26a5a6e5c24a8c2c5fcc99e19cc4a7560c096b", "merged_at": "1424377784", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 7839, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 5, "state": "closed", "title": "Add new eras to support different Run 2 configurations", "updated_at": "1424389963", "user": "mark-grimes"}

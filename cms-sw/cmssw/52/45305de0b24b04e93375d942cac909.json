In this PR we update the dEdx weights and regional e/m factors \r\nso that reconstructed hits are calibrated. With respect to previous work, here we inject weights \r\nper layer, so that they are useful also to both offline and L1T worlds.  \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nIn [these slides](https://apsallid.web.cern.ch/apsallid/Regionalemfactors_V16.pdf) we have validated that this PR works as expected. \r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nThis is not a backport. \r\n\r\n@rovere @pfs @cseez @felicepantaleo @ebrondol @lecriste ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 8, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1642495699", "deletions": 7, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 36728, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 6, "state": "open", "title": "HGCAL RecHits Calibration for V16 geometry scenario", "updated_at": "1642517278", "user": "apsallid"}

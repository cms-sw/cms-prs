In B parking we want to generate B->mumuK in which the mu should not have to pass any filter (probe B). Additionally, we want the filter to be passed by another muon in the event (B+->mu1mu2K, B- -> mu3X, we want to filter mu3 and only mu3). \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe code has been validated in mumuK(*), J/psi(->mumu)K(*) with direct comparison to the analysis code. The gain using the existing filters and this new filter, has also been studied\r\n![mu3_validation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17452912/55168870-f3824300-5173-11e9-900b-3f5183d6f3d2.png)\r\n![gainInUsableMC](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17452912/55169259-be2a2500-5174-11e9-9d3d-2440f7acea67.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 13, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1553782591", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["backport", "comparison-available", "generators-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 26286, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Pythia filter to focus on the probe side of B decays", "updated_at": "1553872417", "user": "gkaratha"}

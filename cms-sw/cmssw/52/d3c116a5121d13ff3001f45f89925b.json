The batch size is configurable and can be set to 1.\r\n\r\nNo physics change is expected (some differences at the level of the numerical precision were found when validating 38007), but the evaluation is about 3 times faster.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nselection step speed up going from blue (old) to red (new) -> reducing a bit the overall tracking time\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7805577/169189739-bfb7a530-ae91-4a40-8310-a213cff0e8ef.png)\r\n\r\nthe physics is the same: \r\nsee e.g. http://uaf-10.t2.ucsd.edu/~legianni/batchDNNSel-PR/plots_ootb/effandfakePtEtaPhi.pdf\r\nor  http://uaf-10.t2.ucsd.edu/~legianni/batchDNNSel-PR/plots_highPurity/effandfakePtEtaPhi.pdf\r\nfor a validation comparison in TTbar with PU.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\nThe PR is a backport of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/38007. It's only aimed to propagate the speed up.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1653465100", "comments": 7, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1653348959", "deletions": 57, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "backport-ok"], "merge_commit_sha": "c99e0582679bf24bab07610b8dd18b4be115fef3", "merged_at": "1653465100", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 38053, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "[12.4.X] TrackTfClassifier with Batch eval - backport of #38007 ", "updated_at": "1653465100", "user": "leonardogiannini"}

Especially in the forward region, most of the rechits passing the cuts were pure noise and created a few false alarms. This commit introduces these changes:\r\n\r\n(1) Update thresholds on rechit energy for rechits to be included in the timing plots.\r\n\r\n(2) Introduce cut on timing error to match offline processing.\r\n\r\n(3) Implement separate energy thresholds for forward region in EE.\r\n\r\nLink to backport for CMSSW online/offline production: #23284 ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1527313517", "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1527001376", "deletions": 17, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "43285f9a5d6ffcb54a20ea3d3133f9b167dca333", "merged_at": "1527313517", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 23283, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "New timing cuts for ECAL (for CMSSW master)", "updated_at": "1527313517", "user": "tanmaymudholkar"}

Therefore prefer to keep this scaling off until such a mechanism is available.\r\n\r\n- adds a protection to the CloseByParticleGun to avoid un-physical cases\r\n\r\n\r\n@cseez @rovere @apsallid @pfs @franzoni ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1572381227", "comments": 14, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1571903121", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "generators-approved", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "539f6dee2ca0f5ef36ef0971a677d0a1f2514558", "merged_at": "1572381227", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 28253, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Switch off the signal scaling for the HGC CEH_Sci sector", "updated_at": "1572381227", "user": "deguio"}

Since I have no idea of whether this is OK, I left it as it is, and I maintained this difference of conventions in the TCDS portion of the code.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nPietro", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 13, "closed_at": "1585550910", "comments": 110, "commits": 56, "created_at": "1583424180", "deletions": 44, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "daq-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "e045dab9e37d05e9572a4d1dce7035aa6414a553", "merged_at": "1585550910", "merged_by": "silviodonato", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 29116, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 76, "state": "closed", "title": "Strips Offline code: TCDS-Scal migration ", "updated_at": "1585550947", "user": "vischia"}

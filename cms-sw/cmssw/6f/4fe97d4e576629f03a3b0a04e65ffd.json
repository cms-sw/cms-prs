This serves not only the HLT scouting community but also the Run 3 demonstrator of the Next Generation Trigger project, task 3.4\r\n\r\nThe main thing changing will be the monitoring elements in the HLT/ScoutingOffline. The preexisting DQM objects remain unchanged, but the ScoutingCollectionMonitor will add a folder called Miscellaneous. This folder will include all the DQM histograms also further ordered by the interface type. An exhaustive list can be found in a talk given in the HLT Scouting Meeting [1].\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe PR has been prepared starting from CMSSW_15_1_0_pre1:\r\n\r\ncmsrel CMSSW_15_1_0_pre1\r\ncd CMSSW_15_1_0_pre1/src\r\ncmsenv\r\ngit cms-init\r\ngit cms-addpkg HLTriggerOffline/Scouting\r\ngit cms-addpkg DQMOffline/HLTScouting\r\n\r\nRunning `git cms-checkdeps -a -A` showed me that there are further dependencies to `DQMOffline/Configuration ` .

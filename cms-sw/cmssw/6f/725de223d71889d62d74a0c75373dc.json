As a knock-on effect, `firstStepPrimaryVertices` are now sorted (similar to `offlnePrimaryVertices`). The sorting will likely cause tiny, numerical-level effect on phase0 tracking.\r\n\r\nMTV plots for phase1 ttbar+PU35 are here\r\nhttps://cms-tracking-validation.web.cern.ch/cms-tracking-validation/PR/CMSSW_9_1_0_pre3_PR19051/\r\ncomparing 910pre3 out of the box (all modules active), recent pixel bad module map, pixelPair iteration w/o the mitigation part, and the full PR.\r\n\r\nTested in 9_1_0_pre3 and CMSSW_9_2_X_2017-05-30-1100. Expecting changes as shown above in phase1, numerical-level changes on phase0 (caused by sorting `firstStepPrimaryVertices`), and no effect on phase2.\r\n\r\n@rovere @VinInn @mtosi @JanFSchulte ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 13, "closed_at": "1496937758", "comments": 32, "commits": 8, "created_at": "1496256262", "deletions": 27, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fastsim-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "7129c93730cc909f5f4d26fa29134725453e3303", "merged_at": "1496937758", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_2_X", "number": 19051, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "Mitigation for inactive pixel regions for phase1 tracking", "updated_at": "1496937758", "user": "makortel"}

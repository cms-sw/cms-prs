They turn to be quite annoying while enabling Info/Verbatim level verbosity for development/debugging. I suggest to remove them. Alternatively they could be downgraded to ```LogDebug``` if deemed still necessary.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles and unit tests run.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1588605850", "comments": 12, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1588574729", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "acf9623a7368ca0bf1200b7411291b4dbf9c2483", "merged_at": "1588605850", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 29623, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "DetectorDescription FilteredView: remove debugging printouts", "updated_at": "1588605850", "user": "fabiocos"}

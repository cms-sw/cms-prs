This one is validation customisations which should be equivalent to the [phase1TkCustoms.customise_Validation](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/CMSSW_8_0_X_2015-11-10-1100/SLHCUpgradeSimulations/Configuration/python/phase1TkCustoms.py#L108) function.\n\n**There should be no change whatsoever unless the Run2_2017 era is active** (the only top-level era that contains phase1Pixel).\n\nI'm assuming HLTValidation_cff.py is not auto-generated (I never know which HLT stuff is or isn't).  If it is I'll have to find somewhere else to put the change.\n\n@atricomi, @delaere:\nNote the lines...\n\n``` python\nprocess.validation_step.remove(process.HLTSusyExoVal)\nprocess.validation_step.remove(process.relvalMuonBits)\n```\n\n...have not been ported from the customisation to the era.  Neither appear to still be in use in 8_0_X.  `HLTSusyExoVal` never seems to be used by anything - there is a `HLTSusyExoValSeq` though, do you know if that should be taken out?  I'll leave it as is unless you say otherwise.\n`relvalMuonBits` appears to be taken out for all sequences now, it's commented out in [HLTriggerOffline/Muon/python/HLTMuonVal_cff.py#L15](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/CMSSW_8_0_X_2015-11-10-1100/HLTriggerOffline/Muon/python/HLTMuonVal_cff.py#L15)\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1447309908", "comments": 4, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1447171389", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "dqm-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "b70678990eced39a2f0f188e01da86f6a1a4e981", "merged_at": "1447309908", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 12359, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "phase1Pixel era validation additions", "updated_at": "1447369955", "user": "mark-grimes"}

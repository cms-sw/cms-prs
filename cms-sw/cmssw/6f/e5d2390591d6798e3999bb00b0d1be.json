Event contents are updated accordingly. ConfigBuilder is adjusted so that the commands here define the workflows successfully:\nhttps://github.com/CmsHI/cmssw/blob/mix_74X_08/HeavyIonsAnalysis/Mixing/test/runChainTemp.sh\n\nTested on \nslc6_amd64_gcc491 \nby\nrunTheMatrix.py -s --useInput all\nrunTheMatrix.py -l 140.53\n\nTo be followed up in later pull-requests:\n- Clean up ConfigBuilder.py, StandardSequences other configs for left-overs form the old heavy-ion embedding workflow\n- Define the RelVal workflows\n- Update PyquenInterface also for the ability to read background event information (special embedding features of Pyquen are temporarily disabled)\n- Update in PlaybackInfo dataformat to keep file info - independent development\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 20, "closed_at": "1421370921", "comments": 24, "commits": 61, "created_at": "1418988222", "deletions": 161, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "comparison-available", "generators-approved", "operations-pending", "pdmv-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "32920ffdb73490d5b44239b4c6ddd444cd7787c2", "merged_at": "1421370921", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 6982, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Adjustments for using MixingModule for Heavy Ion simulations", "updated_at": "1449851367", "user": "yetkinyilmaz"}

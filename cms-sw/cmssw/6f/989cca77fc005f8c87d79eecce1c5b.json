Historically the enrty point of the simhit has been used for this. While this is essentially irrelevant for the definition of the cell (although not the best possible choice), it introduces clear  biases in the resolution studies, shifting the true positions towards the cell boundary. This PR rectify this non optimal position definition.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nValidation plots for the simulated hit position distribution and for the resolution of reconstructed hits and clusters wrt MC truth change as expected, studied with single muon particle gun.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "comments": 6, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1666770429", "deletions": 8, "labels": ["simulation-pending", "dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-rejected", "orp-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_6_X", "number": 39857, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "MTD simulation and validation: move hit position from entry point to local position", "updated_at": "1666980757", "user": "fabiocos"}

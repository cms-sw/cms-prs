[DumpTauVariables_cfi.py, tauVariables_cff.py, dumpTauVariables_cfg.py]\n- a copy of the PhysicsTools/PatAlgos/test/ script for miniAOD production, copied here for convenience, also since I potentially want to adapt it later. [edmTauVariables_slimmed_cfg.py]\n- a simple script that we use in the Higgs 2 Taus subgroup for synchronization tests across analysis groups that I have adapted for the TauPOG use case. [DisplayManager.py, compareTauVariables.py] \n\nI want these scripts to be automatically provided with all future development branches that we open and to be accessible to all developers. This is why I would like to have them part of the official cmssw RecoTauTag/Configuration package. These modifications are light weight. Since only configuration files and standalone scripts are added there are no changes expected in runtime performance of cmsRun nor outputs. For completeness I've run the matrix tests as recommended by RECO (runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all) and no failures have been found as expected. \n\nCheers,\nRoger\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1460612243", "comments": 32, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1459514596", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "02909a0757c4b0eddd56844a0f61cf02944896a1", "merged_at": "1460612243", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 13884, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 4, "state": "closed", "title": "Adding additional atomistic scripts and configs for s/w validation purposes to RecoTauTag/Configuration", "updated_at": "1461060349", "user": "roger-wolf"}

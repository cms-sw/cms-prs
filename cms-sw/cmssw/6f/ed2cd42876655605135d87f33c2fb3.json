Furthermore, the producer got modernized with put tokens and the includes in the `PFProducer` packages were cleaned by not including forward header files in `.cc` sources anymore (which required a few little changes in the DataFormats, as there were some header files which didn't include their own forward header which should optimally be the case).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCMSSW compiles and matrix tests pass.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nNo backport intended.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1586153939", "comments": 31, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1585769283", "deletions": 165, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "511d715de22c9070d7f62770d806ee9ed4d4767b", "merged_at": "1586153939", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 29375, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "PFEGammaProducer to global producer", "updated_at": "1586153940", "user": "guitargeek"}

This means that a const member function of the class will no longer be able to modify the data to which the pointer points. This PR is therefore a partial implementation of issue #12840. The member pointers in the framework that  are _not_ modified by this PR are:\n1) Those in FWLite (will be done in a separate PR).\n2) Pointers to const or pointers already declared mutable (no need to modify).\n3) Those pointers whose modifications require changes that were too extensive or complex to be done in this PR. These will be dealt within a case by case basis.\nOther minor changes made in a very few places in affected code:\na) a few boost::scoped_ptr changed to std::unique_ptr\nb) a few std::auto_ptr changed to std::unique_ptr\nc) iterator loops replaced by range based for loops\nd) nullptr replaces 0 for pointers\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 191, "closed_at": "1453914758", "comments": 6, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1453318879", "deletions": 729, "labels": ["comparison-available", "core-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-rejected"], "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 13015, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 20, "state": "closed", "title": "propagate const for pointer data members", "updated_at": "1454700007", "user": "wmtan"}

The logic inferring the track MVA selector names missed a check that the MVA selector is part of the iteration sequence. This omission lead errors for tracking eras without MVA selection (`trackingLowPU`, `trackingPhase1PU70`, `trackingPhase2PU140`) in trackingOnly workflows. The check is added here.\r\n\r\nTested in CMSSW_8_1_X_2016-11-15-2300, no changes expected in non-trackingOnly workflows, or in trackingOnly workflows with run2 or `trackingPhase1` tracking.\r\n\r\n@rovere @VinInn ", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1479972227", "comments": 19, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1479310166", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["backport", "bug-fix", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved", "urgent"], "merge_commit_sha": "e40a23d737101a331f6202d73fbd416d31d61aff", "merged_at": "1479972227", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 16661, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix MultiTrackValidator MVA monitoring (81X)", "updated_at": "1479972227", "user": "makortel"}

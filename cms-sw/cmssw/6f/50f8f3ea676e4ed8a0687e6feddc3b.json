You can close those two PRs.\n\nThis PR makes the new cut default to OFF, so no changes are expected to occur. A follow-up PR which enables this cut along with others for Heavy-Ion workflows will follow later this week.\n\nThis PR passes matrices 5.1 and 140.53, and I can include the log output if requested.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1438327908", "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1438018303", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "d05ce8b428d6b480c07e1e31444f6e6063dd95dd", "merged_at": "1438327908", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 10405, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Backport of #10194 :Add shower-shape cut capability to electron seed producer", "updated_at": "1438327908", "user": "richard-cms"}

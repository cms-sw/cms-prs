It can be merged safely without impacting existing setups.\r\n\r\n####  PR Validation:\r\n\r\n    The geometry generation and GEN-SIM workflow have been tested successfully.\r\n\r\n    Results confirm that both the detector structure and simulation perform as expected.\r\n\r\nThis is the first PR related to the CRACK project.

Checks added for detid validity. This has been found to spot the origin of the problem observed during DQM study. See related presentations at,\r\na) See \"2022-10-10_HGCal_in_CMSSW.pdf\" by Indranil at https://indico.cern.ch/event/1208397/\r\nb) See Sunada's presentation at https://indico.cern.ch/event/1210093/\r\n\r\n2. Added feature to run muon tomography for selected layers as provided in input instead of all layers. \r\nExpected command will be like,\r\n\r\ncmsRun testHGCalCellHitSum_cfg.py layers=1,4,26,41\r\n\r\nin case results need to be produced for layer number 1,4,26 and 41.\r\n\r\n3. Added feature to mark the first three cell indices(added by Pruthvi). \r\n4. Now can read wafer input files corresponding to HGCAL geometry version v15, v16, v17. \r\n5. Added further documentation. \r\n6. Code cleaning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nrunTheMatrix test is not applicable since it produces a separate tomography related output file.\r\nPlease perform standard test like coding convention and related tests.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

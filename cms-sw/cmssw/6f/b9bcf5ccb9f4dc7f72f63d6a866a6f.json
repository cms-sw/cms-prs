The\nefficiency is computed using the standard DQMGenericClient, using as\nnumerator the number of valid hits for each tracker component, and as\ndenominator the sum of valid and missing hits. All categories of missing\nhits are considered. Hits flagged as inactive or bad are not taken into\naccount, but anyway recorded in other histograms, in case we want to\nmonitor also their efficiencies. The efficiencies are computed wrt the\nnumber of good vertices found in each event. The selection of \"good\nvertex\" is the recommended one: ndof>=4 and isFake is False. Only events\nwith at least one good vertex are monitored. The code is active by\ndefault in Tier-0 processing and, in general, everytime standard DQM\nTracking is active. Both generalTracks and highPurityTracks/pt_1 are\nmonitored separately. The Tracker Geometry has been used as much as\npossible to make the code Upgrade friendly.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 8, "closed_at": "1442744175", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1442411945", "deletions": 51, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "79f31609171ccc3c86b2af816ca706d5fefc7bd5", "merged_at": "1442744175", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 11290, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add tracking hit-finding efficiency from HitPattern", "updated_at": "1442744175", "user": "rovere"}

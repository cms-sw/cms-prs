With this PR in the CMSSW, we can close the MET recipe for 5_3_X.\n\nThe commit https://github.com/TaiSakuma/cmssw/commit/ac3814e10a7b1af43e271b687eeee3c394147242?diff=split edits a file under DataFormats/METReco but doesn't change the data format. It only adds friend operators and won't require to update the checksum.  I am not sure if that is ok.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_5_3_X", "changed_files": 15, "closed_at": "1421241461", "comments": 10, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1419085854", "deletions": 56, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "comparison-pending", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "033f5970acc49d51fd0ad86299f98e1810ee9f17", "merged_at": "1421241461", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_5_3_X", "number": 6994, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "add MET receipe", "updated_at": "1421510047", "user": "TaiSakuma"}

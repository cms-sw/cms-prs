Overall this should increase the number of tracks reconstructed by the Legacy client so that it can fit PVs and eventually the Beamspot.\r\n - Fixed a typo in the name of the Legacy BeamSpotOnline tag\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nShould be validated with playback system in P5, run 346373.\r\n\r\n#### Backport\r\nNot a backport. A forward port to master and 12_1_X will be provided after the playback test.\r\n\r\nFYI @mtosi @gennai @vmariani @dzuolo\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 9, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1635608637", "deletions": 12, "labels": ["dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "urgent"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "number": 35918, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[12_0_X] Improve DQM beamspot clients", "updated_at": "1635674233", "user": "francescobrivio"}

This PR is an update of: \nhttps://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/13849\n- The strategy to catch beam halo events is described in the following presentation: \n  https://indico.cern.ch/event/514418/contribution/17/attachments/1250430/1843419/laurent_v2.pdf\n- The implementation has however changed according to the comments made during the meeting: the information related to calorimeters is now saved in EcalHaloData and HcalHaloData (DataFormats/METReco) rather than in CSCHaloData. Methods using both calo and CSC information are saved in GlobalHaloData. \n  These classes are produced by CSC/Ecal/Hcal/Global HaloProducer (in RecoMET/METProducers). The actual code filling these classes is in CSC/Ecal/Hcal/Global HaloAlgo (in RecoMET/METAlgorithms). \n- A version of the CSCTightHalo filter similar to 2015 is still present (and still the default, for now). It contains the various changes:\n  -Methods using halo trigger bits are set to trivial values. \n  -The matching of segments in opposite endcaps is slightly optimized. \n- Two new filters are also added: \n  GlobalTightHaloFilter2016 and GlobalSuperTightHaloFilter2016\n  The flags are also saved in MINIAOD.\n  These filters use methods from GlobalHaloData, (which is saved in AOD). \n- The Ecal/Hcal HaloData classes now contain a list to all the ECAL/HCAL halo cluster candidates, which themselves contain all the rechits with et>1 (ecal) or 2 (hcal). \n  These classes are saved in RECO but not AOD so far.

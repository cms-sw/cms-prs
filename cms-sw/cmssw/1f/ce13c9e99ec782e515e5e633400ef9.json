It restore computation of transient MC truth data on tracks transfer from tracker to calorimeters. This feature was lost after migration to DD4hep. This information exist only during simulation of an event and is not persistent but is used in special tests, for example with some SimWatchers. The fix is needed in the MC production release.\r\n\r\nNo effect on MC production is expected, no change of hits/digi.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nprivate\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1657852404", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1657687370", "deletions": 15, "labels": ["simulation-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "bug-fix", "orp-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "47214082b01379fe4124b2afbc08a23db8357254", "merged_at": "1657852404", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 38717, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "[12_4_X] Fixed MC truth data on particle transfer from tracker to calorimeter", "updated_at": "1657852404", "user": "civanch"}

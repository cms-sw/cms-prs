I changed \"scal lumi/PU\" to a more generic \"online lumi/PU\", but of course feel free to suggest better names.\r\n>\r\n>Minor technical improvements (e.g. `const`-ness of class data members) were done in the process.\r\n>\r\n>(In case this is backported to `12_4_X`, it should not warrant a new `ConfDB` parsing, since the new configuration parameter of `LumiMonitor`, i.e. `onlineMetaDataDigis`, already defaults to the intended collection; at the same time, `hltOnlineMetaDataDigis` should in principle be included in the `DQMHistograms` EndPath in the HLT menus.)\r\n\r\nThis is not an exact backport because of 3af98ee5f6c: the renaming of the parameter `LumiMonitor.FolderName (-> .folderName)`, done in #39859, is not backported to `12_5_X` in order to avoid extra complications to HLT online operations.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nNone beyond the validation done for #39859.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

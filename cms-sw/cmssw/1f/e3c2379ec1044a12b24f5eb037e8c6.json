In case of multiple timestamp collapsing in the same run, the first IOV is considered. In case of timestamp with no match to existing run, the IOV is skipped.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nStand-alone local tests\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1616595597", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1616395527", "deletions": 18, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "db-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "fe4dbec89604226f9dfd8e5c334548ec26706755", "merged_at": "1616595597", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 33241, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "conddb command line tools: support of conversion timestamp->run  for copy function", "updated_at": "1616595597", "user": "ggovi"}

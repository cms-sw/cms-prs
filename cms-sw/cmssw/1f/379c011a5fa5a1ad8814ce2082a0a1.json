At the moment the Phase1 workflows don't even run with `--command=\"--no_exec\"`, you'll get the error:\n\n```\ncustomising the process with cust_2017 from SLHCUpgradeSimulations/Configuration/combinedCustoms\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  <snip>\n  File \"/afs/cern.ch/cms/sw/ReleaseCandidates/vol1/slc6_amd64_gcc493/cms/cmssw/CMSSW_7_6_X_2015-08-10-2300/python/SLHCUpgradeSimulations/Configuration/phase1TkCustoms.py\", line 222, in customise_Reco\n    process.reconstruction_fromRECO.remove(process.initialStepSelector)\nAttributeError: 'Process' object has no attribute 'initialStepSelector'\n```\n\n...and no config file is generated.\n\nNote that the Phase1 workflows (e.g. `runTheMatrix.py -w upgrade -l 10000.0`) don't actually run at the moment - this PR just allows the config files to be generated with the `--no_exec` command.  Pull request #10353 will get the workflows as far as reco.\n\nI don't expect this to be the final version of the customisation functions, they will probably need a big overhaul[*] but at least this lets runTheMatrix run.

The logic is modified in the class `GenericTriggerEventFlag` which is used in several DQM clients.  \r\nNo differences are expected in Run1 and Run2 workflows. For Run3 data the selector should now work correctly.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRun successfully `runTheMatrix.py -l imited --ibeos`\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nN/A", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 47, "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1646033117", "deletions": 10, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "l1-pending", "hlt-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 37084, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "migration to `DCSRecord` of `GenericTriggerEventFlag`", "updated_at": "1646068934", "user": "mmusich"}

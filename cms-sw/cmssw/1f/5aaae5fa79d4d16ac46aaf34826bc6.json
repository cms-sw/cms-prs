The problem\nwas StringCutObjectSelector is not const thread safe (i.e. it has a const\nfunction which modifies its internal state) and therefore only one thread\nat a time can call it. Therefore MultiTrackSelector can not simultaneously\ntalk to multiple events which means it can not be a global module. However, \nconverting the module to a stream module is thread safe.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_2_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1410960501", "comments": 6, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1410893840", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "05e3af3a79a06c7e19691d50fa14cb2a7aaa3251", "merged_at": "1410960501", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_2_X", "number": 5324, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Converted MultiTrackSelector from global to stream", "updated_at": "1411653471", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

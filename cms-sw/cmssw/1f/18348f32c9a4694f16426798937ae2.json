This avoids problems where PluginFactoryBase and PluginManager may acquire their locks in different order based on the activity going on.\nPluginManager also uses thread-safe containers however the mutex is still used to protect dlopen calls as well as access to loadingLibraryNamed_ value. Using the thread-safe container does mean we no longer have to take a lock if the shared library in question has already been loaded.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1382346854", "comments": 4, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1382111680", "deletions": 42, "labels": ["core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "9c95983763c9e843aa4c327ddbf4a23cf1238ded", "merged_at": "1382346854", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_0_0_pre7", "number": 1111, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Use tbb thread safe containers to protect plugin system data structures", "updated_at": "1382346854", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

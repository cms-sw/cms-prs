This PR adds this flag for HF PFRecHit cleaning.\r\n\r\n(*) https://indico.cern.ch/event/944298/timetable/#10-pf-noise-cleaning-for-hcal\r\n\r\nAlso following discussions on https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/27767 and a request from @abdoulline we put the HBHENegativeNoise flag ineffective starting from Run 3 (this flag won't be created from Run 3, so it was not really necessary, but this change was made to avoid potential confusions).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nWe don't expect a large change by addition of HFSignalAsymmetry to HF PFRecHit cleaning. As seen in: https://indico.cern.ch/event/1027487/#36-hf-noise-flagging-for-pf, we do not see any concerning changes. If we may say, slight reduction in MET in MET PD which is expected to include some high MET events due to noise is probably a positive effect.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nThis is not a backport.\r\n\r\n@bendavid @laurenhay @marksan87 @abdoulline @toropin ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1619763275", "comments": 36, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1619312778", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "operations-approved", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "d5801d3a22a93ccfa777d1ddaa1f7d27601347c1", "merged_at": "1619763274", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "number": 33520, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "Adopt HFSignalAsymmetry flag in HF PFRecHit cleaning", "updated_at": "1619763275", "user": "hatakeyamak"}

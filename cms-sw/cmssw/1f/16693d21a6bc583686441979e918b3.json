This is now fixed for both versions.\r\n- The `cmsml` package was introduced in the linked PR and deprecates a few tools previously located in `PhysicsTools/TensorFlow/python/tools.py`. As far as I see, these tools were only used in the `PhysicsTools/TensorFlow` tests, which I updated accordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation\r\n\r\nThe unit tests of both packages are passing now.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1614091474", "comments": 8, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1613637600", "deletions": 242, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "f17886c71ef1e23200cb75e2ac1fda70b8b5b89a", "merged_at": "1614091474", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 32942, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Adapt python code to updated ML software", "updated_at": "1615101462", "user": "riga"}

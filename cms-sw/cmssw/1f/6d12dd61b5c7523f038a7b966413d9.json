Here, the PF-based b-taggers are added to the standard Reco sequence alongside the legacy b-taggers. In subsequent PRs validation, PAT, etc. need to be switched to the PF-based taggers and finally the legacy taggers will be removed from the standard Reco sequence.\n\nIn the attached plots and in https://indico.cern.ch/event/359461/session/0/contribution/2/material/slides/0.pdf performance comparison between the legacy and PF-based taggers can be seen.\n\n**Legacy vs PF-based taggers from MiniAOD**\n\n![btageffvsmistagrate_udsg_pf](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4885289/5608523/985e437e-9454-11e4-8f11-8116cb94aa71.png)\n![btageffvsmistagrate_c_pf](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4885289/5608524/9b178daa-9454-11e4-9251-80899edb132e.png)\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 60, "closed_at": "1420982925", "comments": 17, "commits": 9, "created_at": "1420419625", "deletions": 178, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-available", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "8e454fbbdeae8bcc8ae9aea5935e9c7b4e07e1b1", "merged_at": "1420982925", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 7041, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 7, "state": "closed", "title": "PF-based b-taggers in the standard Reco", "updated_at": "1421021656", "user": "ferencek"}

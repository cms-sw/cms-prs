This patch was tested on a T0 VM which hit this\nissue.\n\nRecursion is used (so bind-mounts-that-have-bind-mounts are OK);\npatch includes cycle detection (although I'm not sure how one can\nform a cycle, but I hate infinite recursion).\n\nThis is a forward port of #8813.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1429857307", "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1429831606", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "core-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "d042be782d100c93fca45ff7c40e6e0aa4b7f633", "merged_at": "1429857307", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 8862, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Allow local file system detection to handle bind mounts.", "updated_at": "1429857307", "user": "bbockelm"}

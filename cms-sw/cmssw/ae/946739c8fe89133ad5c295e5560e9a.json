Details about the expected LHC conditions and the effects that have been considered have been presented in the PPD meeting [here](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1045566/#36-update-of-pu-profile-for-ru). To build the scenario, we have simulated an LHC fill of 10h with an initial 2h leveling period. This has to be understood as an optimistic average of all 2022 fills which are planned to converge to 6h leveling periods at the end of 2022. The fraction of events with a given average pileup is weighted by the instantaneous luminosity.\r\n\r\n![Scenario10h2h_lw](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24874409/125771017-70976353-acb7-48b1-97e4-fb89d7997426.png)\r\n\r\nWe tested running cmsDriver with `--pileup 2022_LHC_Simulation_10h_2h` by hand and found no problems.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1626839970", "comments": 30, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1626176621", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "operations-approved", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "863a884f54e1ca56e078dfd7a0363f34edb8b2b6", "merged_at": "1626839970", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "number": 34460, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "New Run3 pileup scenario: 10h fill, 2h leveling", "updated_at": "1626839971", "user": "knollejo"}

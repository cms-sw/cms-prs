In these \"BPH\" tables we are storing Kshort->, 0->p candidates and the B->+-, =+,*0,, short, 0 candidates and other usefull quantities that are used by many BPH analysis for branching ratio, angular analysis or CPV measurements. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, we add tables that can be used for the BPH trigger studies and trigger efficiencies measurement. \r\n\r\nFYI: @drkovalskyi @gkaratha @ftorrresd @vlimant @hqucms @makortel \r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 46, "comments": 68, "commits": 48, "created_at": "1742054252", "deletions": 29, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-pending", "xpog-pending", "tracking", "changes-dataformats"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 47603, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 34, "state": "open", "title": "BPHNanoAODs", "updated_at": "1746034424", "user": "gmelachr"}

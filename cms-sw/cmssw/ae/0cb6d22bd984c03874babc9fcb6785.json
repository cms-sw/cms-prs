This causes the DQM application to crash. This problem has been present for a few months at least, but its frequency has increased over the last few weeks.\r\n\r\nThis fix adds a try-catch block around the offending line in the DQM code so that such digis are ignored, but at least the calibration application does not crash; in addition, a detailed warning is written to the logs to help ECAL experts with more detailed troubleshooting.\r\n\r\nLink to corresponding PR for CMSSW master: https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/20902", "branch": "CMSSW_9_2_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1513937585", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1507750400", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_9_2_X", "number": 20901, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Patch to ignore events causing ECAL DQM Calibration application crashes.", "updated_at": "1513937585", "user": "tanmaymudholkar"}

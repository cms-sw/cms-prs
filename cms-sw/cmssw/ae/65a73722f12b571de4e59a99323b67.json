The DD4hep ```DDFilteredView``` is updated by adding a method ```copyNumbers``` that has the same meaning as in DDD.\r\n\r\nThe ```GeometricTimingDetAnalyzer``` has also been revisited in order to provide a detailed dump of the product of the MTDNumberingBuilder and serve for comparisons in the rewriting of this component.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe old tests run on scenario D50 without issues, and now the printout in ```MTDTopologyAnalyzer``` is fixed (previously partially not working).", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 13, "closed_at": "1581709423", "comments": 42, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1580990452", "deletions": 1468, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "ccb6e55909f10c03aac3ca558c6c4e41f2a031de", "merged_at": "1581709423", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 28875, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "MTD reco geometry: preliminary cleaning", "updated_at": "1581709423", "user": "fabiocos"}

Most of this code is related to keeping track of which products were consumed by modules in SubProcesses so that the producers of those products would not get deleted.\r\n\r\nThis is the 3rd PR in a series of PRs removing the SubProcess feature. See #47565 and #47659. There are two more coming after this one which will be related to SubProcess and Services and then one related to SubProcess and EventSetup.\r\n\r\nResolves https://github.com/cms-sw/framework-team/issues/1286\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRelies on existing tests. This PR is mostly deletions of code. Nothing to test. There are already unit tests for the module deletion code itself that verify it is not broken by these changes.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 15, "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1745330940", "deletions": 128, "labels": ["core-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 47930, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Remove code supporting SubProcess and related to module deletion", "updated_at": "1745344520", "user": "wddgit"}

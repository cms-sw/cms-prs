Plots added cover GEM occupancy, timing, and comparison of GEM inputs to CSC inputs. \r\nThis PR also fixes a minor mistake in some CSC DQM plots where hits from neighboring chambers were filled in the wrong bins.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis development has been studied with RelVal ZMM samples and recent cosmic data. All DQM plots are generated and filled as expected. (As the GEM firmware is being tested and updated, EMTF does not receive meaningful inputs from GEM in cosmic runs for the moment. But the DQM part works fine.) \r\nThe PR passed local unit tests and matrix test. \r\nCode format check was also run locally and code was updated accordingly.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\nNot a backport.\r\n\r\n@eyigitba ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1628065548", "comments": 9, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1627642888", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "b525e85ef76e3abb8b8d9467b5279a0f308746a5", "merged_at": "1628065548", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "number": 34706, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Online DQM: Add EMTF DQM plots on GEM information and their comparison to CSC inputs", "updated_at": "1628065548", "user": "zuoxunwu"}

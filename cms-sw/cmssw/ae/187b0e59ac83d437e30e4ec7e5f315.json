Two new records are added, `JetResolutionRcd` and `JetResolutionScaleFactorRcd`, storing respectively resolutions and scale factors. Both resolutions and scale factors are converted to a common object, `JetResolutionObject`, which is serialized into the corresponding records.\n\nFacility are provided to create a database from text files [1] and to create text files from a database or a GT [2].\n\nUsers can access values using the classes `JetResolution` and `JetResolutionScaleFactors`. A static function is provided to hide the boilerplate to retrieve the object from the condition database. A demo analyzer is included as an how-to tutorial [3]\n\nThis interface has been presented and validated yesterday to the JERC meeting.\n\nI targeted CMSSW 7.5.x during my development, bu we'd like to see this also back-ported to 7.4.x\n\n[1] https://github.com/blinkseb/cmssw/blob/665bd5d702f5ed976a898b7f8c426a5955eaf103/JetMETCorrections/Modules/test/JetResolutionDBWriter_cfg.py\n[2] https://github.com/blinkseb/cmssw/blob/665bd5d702f5ed976a898b7f8c426a5955eaf103/JetMETCorrections/Modules/test/JetResolutionLocalDBReader_cfg.py\n[3] https://github.com/blinkseb/cmssw/blob/665bd5d702f5ed976a898b7f8c426a5955eaf103/JetMETCorrections/Modules/plugins/JetResolutionDemo.cc\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 27, "closed_at": "1438148538", "comments": 4, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1437746394", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["alca-rejected", "analysis-pending", "comparison-pending", "db-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 10350, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 11, "state": "closed", "title": "JER integration into conditions database", "updated_at": "1438148538", "user": "blinkseb"}

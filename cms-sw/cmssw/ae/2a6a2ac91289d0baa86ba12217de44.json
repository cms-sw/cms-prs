The goal is ensuring that the fresh-keys identifying the cached data in the squids are not shared with other workflows/processes. In this way, unintended interferences and unwanted data are avoided.\r\n\r\nThe keys will be provided as an external parameter for the read-only ESSource-based workflows, and as the content of a specified file for the update-capable workflows.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nUnit tests and integration tests\r\n\r\n\r\nBackport of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/33505\r\n\r\nThe backport is required to operate the online workflows: HLT, DQM/BeamSpot\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1619768088", "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1619583380", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["alca-approved", "db-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "7d32e5adcd4b639607de383ac396eacfc40d407b", "merged_at": "1619768088", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 33558, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Support of private frontier Key for workflow-specific caching", "updated_at": "1619768089", "user": "ggovi"}

It is turned on by default and the requirements for running the tau RECO sequence are\n1) pt > 14 GeV\n2) |eta| < 2.5\n\nThe performance change is expected - loss of efficiency for very low pt true taus, and also decreased fake rate for very low pt jets.\n\nHowever, no change is expected for the taus passing recommended kinematical cuts (pt > 20 GeV + |eta| < 2.3).\n\nThis is shown on slides: https://indico.cern.ch/event/316898/material/0/0.pdf\n\nAdditionally, one can expect improvement of overall timing needed for tauRECO (as the algorithm is executed fewer times) and also size reduction in the RECO PFTauCollection, as it will contain fewer candidates.\n\nPR's #3558 and #3594 are being closed as they have been rendered moot by the #3631\n\n@veelken and @monicava, this is something you wanted to watch as well\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "changed_files": 11, "closed_at": "1400045172", "comments": 11, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1399574504", "deletions": 26, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "b13219a662ebed7ef8f1cd81baf74fc8794f9f3d", "merged_at": "1400045172", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_1_0_pre8", "number": 3762, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Adding pre-selection to input (AK4) jets for tau RECO", "updated_at": "1403558335", "user": "jpavel"}

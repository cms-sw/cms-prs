This problem arose because muons were included outside the fiducial region. To resolve this issue, we are applying a -2cm fiducial cut for the etapartition surface. This PR ensures that unnecessary muons are excluded and the actual TnP efficiency is measured correctly. Also, we have naming scheme change of the TnP plots in this PR.\r\nSlides detailing this change were presented to the GEM DPG group.\r\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/1583374/contributions/6673161/subcontributions/570253/attachments/3127309/5547236/GEMTnPUnderflowStacking%20(2).pdf\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1914\" height=\"969\" alt=\"GE11hist_long_xy_hitExists\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eeea9a45-49da-4afe-a8be-efe81735be2e\" />\r\nChambermatch with matching rechit at GE1/1. They are living inside etapartition surface, where strips lie. But when you give fiducial region 2cm smaller than chamber surface, you include area without strips, therefore reducing efficiency.\r\n\r\n[runTheMatrix.py](https://runthematrix.py/) -l limited -i all --ibeos\r\n50 49 46 41 19 1 1 1 1 1 1 tests passed, 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 failed\r\n1 fail also fails on the plain master branch.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

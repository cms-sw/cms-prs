This issue would have resulted in an error in the case where a user wanted to supply a custom operating point for a specific JetID variable.  This is a yet to be used functionality and does not affect the JetID value in any way, but in theory it should be useable for internal tests.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 1, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1542728279", "deletions": 12, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "code-checks-pending", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_4_X", "number": 25306, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Winter16 jetID update to include lepton veto ", "updated_at": "1542728314", "user": "knash"}

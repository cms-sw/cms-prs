This issue would have resulted in an error in the case where a user wanted to supply a custom operating point for a specific JetID variable.  This is a yet to be used functionality and does not affect the JetID value in any way, but in theory it should be useable for internal tests.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1543592276", "comments": 21, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1542728279", "deletions": 21, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "orp-approved", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "55ea3d115fdadd1a9267135e0451cdc3c2676a2c", "merged_at": "1543592276", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_4_X", "number": 25306, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 6, "state": "closed", "title": "Winter16 jetID update to include lepton veto ", "updated_at": "1543592276", "user": "knash"}

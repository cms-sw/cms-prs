Now they are both set to `'.'` so there should not be any conflict.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nSome of these updates were already successfully tested during last MWGR (e.g. tag/jobName in playback). The others have been tested running the unitTest on lxplus.\r\n\r\n#### Backport\r\n#32415 ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1608107701", "comments": 20, "commits": 8, "created_at": "1607371911", "deletions": 77, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "e63915a2b861afdd598a214b5f9bc17ff543f5f2", "merged_at": "1608107700", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 32408, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "BeamSpotOnline updates", "updated_at": "1608107701", "user": "francescobrivio"}

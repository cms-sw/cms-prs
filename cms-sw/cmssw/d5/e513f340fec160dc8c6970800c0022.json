I assume this is a task of JetMET to modify the code to accept NoHLT from FastSim.\r\n- Next steps:\r\n   - Adding VALIDATION:@miniAODValidation is maybe the next step. My stupid question, what is difference between VALIDATION:@miniAODValidation and DQM:@miniAODDQM. How we choose which module should land on which?\r\n   - NanoAOD: The structure needs to change, by splitting GEN out from NANO.\r\n\r\nFYI @sbein \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nRun the config files from the following `runTheMatrix` work,\r\n`runTheMatrix.py --what upgrade -l 13234.0 --command=\"-n 100\" --wm init`\r\n\r\nAdditional DQM histrograms are up as expected. One can see from https://tinyurl.com/25u6xovu (with this PR), compared with https://tinyurl.com/27xwxcqh (without this PR)\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\nNo need of backport.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1658574669", "comments": 33, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1657790198", "deletions": 10, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "operations-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 38736, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add miniAODDQM FastSim Validation", "updated_at": "1658574669", "user": "srimanob"}

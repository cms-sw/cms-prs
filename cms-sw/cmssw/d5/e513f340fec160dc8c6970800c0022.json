My stupid question, what is difference between VALIDATION:@miniAODValidation and DQM:@miniAODDQM. How we choose which module should land on which?\r\n- There are warning from JetMET analyzer as it looks for HLT. I assume this is a task of JetMET to modify the code to accept NoHLT from FastSim.\r\n\r\nFYI @sbein \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nRun the config files from the following `runTheMatrix` work,\r\n`runTheMatrix.py --what upgrade -l 11634.301 --command=\"-n 100\" --wm init`\r\n\r\nAdditional DQM histrograms are up as expected. One can see from https://tinyurl.com/25u6xovu (with this PR), compared with https://tinyurl.com/27xwxcqh (without this PR)\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

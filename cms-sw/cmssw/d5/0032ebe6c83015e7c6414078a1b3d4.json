However, all events were associated to the default device, instead of the correct one, leading to a runtime error when multiple devices were used.\r\n\r\nThese changes associate to the correct CUDA device the events used to track if the conditions have been transferred.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nSee #34948 .\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nBackport of #34948 .\r\n\r\nWould be useful to have, if there are plans to use this release cycle for more online tests.", "branch": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1629717106", "comments": 18, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1629361353", "deletions": 12, "labels": ["fully-signed", "tests-approved", "bug-fix", "orp-approved", "backport-ok", "heterogeneous-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "944e28b2a23232b7ef6c3d5d3f36abb89a3bdbef", "merged_at": "1629717106", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 34950, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix uploading the EventSetup conditions to multiple CUDA devices [11.3.x]", "updated_at": "1629717106", "user": "fwyzard"}

I hope that this will be merged relatively soon so that this PR and fixes for 75X data don't interfere with each other.\nAutomatically ported from CMSSW_7_5_X #9532 (original by @hroskes).\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 8, "closed_at": "1436970767", "comments": 8, "commits": 11, "created_at": "1435042969", "deletions": 79, "labels": ["alca-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "248ca2356ad11cb6146acb7bce76212bc6da4ff9", "merged_at": "1436970767", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 9812, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "More All-In-One tool improvements", "updated_at": "1437331188", "user": "cmsbuild"}

It also brings the output of the package in line with the L1TTrackMatch:L1TkPrimaryVertexProducer output, but does supersede that older piece of code in functionality. The L1TkPrimaryVertexProducer is removed and all upstream consumers switched to using the VertexProducer from L1Trigger/VertexFinder.\r\n\r\nAnother major update is that the VertexProducer is changed to be an edm::global::EDProducer. This, coupled with some additional new producers. Allows much of the code to be multi-threaded. This doubles the speed of the ntupler.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe output of the VertexNtupler from L1Trigger/VertexFinder was compared to the output from L1TrackObjectNtupleMaker in L1Trigger/L1TTrackMatch. By matching the two outputs we can see that the output of the newer VertexProducer matches that of the older piece of code.\r\n\r\nBackport of https://github.com/cms-l1t-offline/cmssw/pull/882\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nBackport of https://github.com/cms-l1t-offline/cmssw/pull/882\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 39, "closed_at": "1623161095", "comments": 26, "commits": 12, "created_at": "1622812992", "deletions": 1502, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "7a4f4cebed3783381cb121bd7a2797288b45d712", "merged_at": "1623161095", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "number": 33978, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 4, "state": "closed", "title": "L1T phase-2: Update VertexFinder and remove the old L1TkPrimaryVertexProducer", "updated_at": "1623161096", "user": "cecilecaillol"}

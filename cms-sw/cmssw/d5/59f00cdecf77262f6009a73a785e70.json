Note that there is reduced functionality for MiniAODs, since some information about PF is not included in this format.\r\n\r\nThe calibrations have been tested, and @nurfikri89 has checked the configuration.\r\n\r\nI am also tagging the PF conveners for reference: @ahinzmann @stahlleiton \r\n\r\nI am guessing this should get merged into master, but the diff is very large, so I would appreciate any guidance on how to handle that.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_15_0_X", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1764091986", "comments": 8, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1763749564", "deletions": 219, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_0_X", "number": 49438, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "PF Offline DQM MiniAOD compatibility and jet calibration addition", "updated_at": "1764091987", "user": "jroloff"}

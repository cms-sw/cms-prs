This is the basic integration of AdePT.\r\nNote that further changes are needed in CMSSW to handle the parallel tracking on the GPU, so this PR alone is not functional. As discussed with @civanch\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested locally that AdePT works and runs, however, as multiple other things are needed, no automated test can be added for this initial PR.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nDoes not apply\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": "1761028861", "comments": 21, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1760875931", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["simulation-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "63f91c46e6e8f9ae3aab9fa27603ed29f9e5737b", "merged_at": "1761028861", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_16_0_X", "number": 49185, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "integrate AdePT via new physics list FTFP_BERT_EMA", "updated_at": "1761028862", "user": "SeverinDiederichs"}

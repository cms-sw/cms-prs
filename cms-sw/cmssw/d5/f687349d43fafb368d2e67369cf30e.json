This is problematic because some early Run3 analyses need at least some kind of built-in ID in nano, and Run3 specific IDs will need some time to be ready. In this PR, we are enabling Run2 electron IDs in Run3 nano. The same for photon IDs (+necessary fixes to make the full chain work) was done in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/38810. \r\n\r\nI have also enabled the electron nano DQM, which I found to be disabled in Run3 nano! I don't see why it should be disabled, so I had enabled it.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n`runTheMatrix.py -l 11634.0` had worked.\r\n\r\nI think we would need a backport of this to 12_4_X, because Run3 nano production will be in 12_4_X.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1658740396", "deletions": 37, "labels": ["fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "xpog-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 38853, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Keep Run2 electron IDs in Run3 nano for early analyses", "updated_at": "1659161355", "user": "swagata87"}

Pointers to const and pointers declared mutable do not need propagate_const. A very few pointers were left undone because the changes involved would be complex enough that more attention is required.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 26, "closed_at": "1455601789", "comments": 45, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1454641154", "deletions": 90, "labels": ["comparison-available", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "aa622a9d7c82cdd5944579d965d879ef754e5093", "merged_at": "1455601789", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 13200, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 12, "state": "closed", "title": "Implement propagate_const in FWLite", "updated_at": "1455640682", "user": "wmtan"}

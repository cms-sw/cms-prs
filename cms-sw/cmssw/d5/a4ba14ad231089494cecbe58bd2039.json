The following changes were needed:\r\n\r\n- DQM/Integration/python/clients/hcal2_dqm_sourceclient-live_cfg.py: use only eras.run2_HF_2017 era, and remove hbheplan1 producer (go back to hbhereco). The GT is forced to be 90X_dataRun2_HLT_frozen_v2. \r\n- DQM/HcalCommon/interface/Constants.h: the 8_3_0 emap still includes crate 36 (uMNio/laser was moved to crate 38), so I put that back in the crate-FED maps.  \r\n\r\n@vkhristenko ", "branch": "CMSSW_8_3_X", "changed_files": 17, "closed_at": "1488443374", "comments": 2, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1488356731", "deletions": 395, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "number": 17661, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Backport 9_0_0_pre5 changes to 8_3_0", "updated_at": "1488443374", "user": "DryRun"}

In order to remove this last vestige of boost::shared_ptr,\nusers of EventSetup need to be converted to std::shared_ptr. This PR does this for FastSim packages.\nAlso, std::make_shared is implemented where it makes sense, because it simplifies the code and saves a memory allocation.\nThis PR is totally technical.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1459785008", "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1459603388", "deletions": 12, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fastsim-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "2c103d55a1bdc2bd03adef8b211adbaa093e1794", "merged_at": "1459785008", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 13896, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Use std::shared_ptr and std::make_shared (EventSetup in FastSim)", "updated_at": "1464230158", "user": "wmtan"}

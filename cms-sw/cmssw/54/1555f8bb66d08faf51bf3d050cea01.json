We also removed the `onlyScouting` condition everywhere as we now do save the online lumi metadata so it is no longer needed.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis PR was developed in `CMSSW_16_0_X_2026-01-25-2300`, using the packages `DQM/Integration` and `DQM/HLTEvF`.\r\n\r\nWe validated by copying the content of the [DQM-Integration repository](https://github.com/cms-data/DQM-Integration) and then running the following test:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncmsRun DQM/Integration/python/clients/scouting_dqm_sourceclient-live_cfg.py runInputDir=DQM-Integration runNumber=398183 scanOnce=True\r\n```\r\n\r\nfollowed by the subsequent inspection of the output histograms. We also tested the workflow via:\r\n```\r\nrunTheMatrix.py -l  145.415 -t 4 -j 8\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

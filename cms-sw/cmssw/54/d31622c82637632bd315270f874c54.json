The jet smearing used to compute the JER variation is small and does not reduce significantly the processing rate\nAutomatically ported from CMSSW_8_1_X #16435 (original by @cms-met).", "branch": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1479368604", "comments": 3, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1479285894", "deletions": 10, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-started"], "merge_commit_sha": "258e237cfaaf9c820ac7a0e77fddb62c8a53d0aa", "merged_at": "1479368604", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "number": 16620, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "JER MET uncertainties and METSignifiance re-estimation", "updated_at": "1479368604", "user": "cmsbuild"}

This is done by modifying `NPUTablesProducer.cc`  to find the maximum value in the `vector<float>` returned by `getPU_pT_hats()` and then store in the PileUp table. \r\n\r\nA flag is also added and set to **false** in `globals_cff.py` so that this variable will not be stored in the main NanoAODs. The flag is set to true in `custom_jme_cff.py` so that it will be stored in the JME custom NanoAOD format.  \r\n\r\nThe variable is needed by JERC analyses, which will use the JME Custom NanoAODs. \r\n\r\nAs mentioned in a comment in #31831, by running over 5K events on a UL17 TTJets sample, the size per event is 9.478 kb/event which is an increase of 0.04% from 9.474 kb/event.\r\n\r\n**if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:**\r\n\r\nOriginal PR is #31831", "branch": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1603808700", "comments": 23, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1603188208", "deletions": 76, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved", "xpog-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "dc5898f8dc120083560cfb4928166da685b52e4b", "merged_at": "1603808700", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 31872, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Backport of #31831 (Add maximum of pileup pT hats in JME custom NanoAOD) to 10_6_X", "updated_at": "1603808701", "user": "nurfikri89"}

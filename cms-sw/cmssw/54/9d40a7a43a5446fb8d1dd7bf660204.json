The changes got lost in Serialization.cc, but not in Serialization.h.\nThis inconsistency is causing fatal compilation errors in package CondCore/CondDB in\nCMSSW_7_5_ROOT5_X.\nThis PR restores Giacomo's changes, and fixes the build errors.  Incidentally, this PR makes this file identical in CMSSW_7_5_X and CMSSW_7_5_ROOT5_X.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_ROOT5_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1433523326", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1433274391", "deletions": 137, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "fully-signed", "tests-rejected"], "merge_commit_sha": "03d96523bf369a772a5c4250ea1491798a9d990f", "merged_at": "1433523326", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "number": 9427, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Removed serialization based on Root, since it is not used.

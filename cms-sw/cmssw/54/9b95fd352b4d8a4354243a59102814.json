This GCC and C99 extension is not allowed in\nC++. Clang has only minimal support.\n\nFrom Clang documentation:\n\n```\nThe element type of a variable length array must be a POD (\"plain old\ndata\") type, which means that it cannot have any user-declared\nconstructors or destructors, any base classes, or any members of non-POD\ntype. All C types are POD types.\n```\n\nThe patch replaces non-POD VLAs with `std::vector` with default-inserted\n`std::string` instances.\n\nWe also could create an array in heap. That would work also.\n\nPlease review and test the changes.\n\nSigned-off-by: David Abdurachmanov David.Abdurachmanov@cern.ch\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1421831206", "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1421421182", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "11cc84693e85dda15fe92403e0865f4504f27fa4", "merged_at": "1421831206", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 7238, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "CondTools/Ecal: drop VLA of non-POD type", "updated_at": "1421831206", "user": "davidlt"}

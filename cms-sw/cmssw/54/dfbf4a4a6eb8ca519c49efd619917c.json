Previously the code that\nchecks for this case depended on detecting an\nexact match between a newly produced branch name\nand an old one. Because of TriggerResults this\nworked most of the time, but failed in cases where\na new TriggerResults was not produced or the old\nTriggerResults was dropped and there was no other\nbranch with such a name conflict. The symptom of\nthe bug was a completely different exception with\na confusing message from some other part of the\ncode that depended on the process names being\nunique.\n\nThis change adds a new explicit check that always\nruns in all cases.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1469683528", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1469631160", "deletions": 10, "labels": ["comparison-available", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "f754f948cda6e95868e8f23ad6e07c952e0dd224", "merged_at": "1469683528", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 15309, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix checking for duplicate process names", "updated_at": "1482170660", "user": "wddgit"}

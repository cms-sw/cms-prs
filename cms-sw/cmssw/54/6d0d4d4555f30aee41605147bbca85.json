The corresponding code in SimTracker, Validation and DQM is still being adapted to CMSSW_8_1_X. \n\nFor now, only the main algorithms are functional. Others are introduced here but commented out for now and will become effective in a future development. Still, it is important to have the classes there already for bookkeeping reasons.\n\nThis PR is the basis for the track trigger developments and studies needed for the tracker TDR.\n\n@boudoul , @sudhaahuja FYI\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 42, "closed_at": "1462279080", "comments": 18, "commits": 19, "created_at": "1457711131", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["comparison-available", "l1-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "793977ac7a3dc8fdf36402ed62f18d1b51037151", "merged_at": "1462279080", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 13696, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 18, "state": "closed", "title": "Migration of L1 tracker primitives from SLHCDEV", "updated_at": "1462279080", "user": "delaere"}

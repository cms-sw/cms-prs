It is easy to track this down to the score used to select the \"best candiate\" among all those spurring from the same seed. It's current tuning is clearly adjusted to reduce fake-rate in particular for \"low pt\" tracks.  Waiting for a clever score (ML based?) here we try to mitigate the effect increasing the weight of the number of hits w/r/t the chi2 for tracks with pt>0.9GeV (which seems to be a magic number in the whole history of CMS tracker).\r\n \r\nSome evidence\r\nSingleMuon 4GeV (PhaseI 810pre16) hit efficiency\r\nblack 810 out of the box\r\nblue same w/o muon-seeding iterations\r\norange same + the proposed mitigation\r\n![effmu4pt](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4143702/20340901/2b455bc0-abe4-11e6-8a47-457420469f74.png)\r\n\r\nhere for real data JetHT Run 279685\r\nblack out of the box\r\nblue proposed mitigation\r\n\r\n![effrealdata](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4143702/20341830/24af4358-abe8-11e6-9b67-9fa47a5782d9.png)\r\n\r\nhere is MTV for usual ttbar25ns PU35 phase0\r\nhttps://innocent.web.cern.ch/innocent/RelVal/pu35_81_16f10pt/plots_highPurity/effandfake1.pdf\r\n\r\nand in case you wonder, that's what happens if the pt cut is NOT applied\r\nhttps://innocent.web.cern.ch/innocent/RelVal/pu35_81_16f10d/plots_highPurity/effandfake1.pdf\r\na future technical PR will try to optimize and  factorize code (it will most probably recompile half tracking and tracking dependent code)", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1479298435", "comments": 9, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1479283198", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 16592, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "increase track length w/o increasing fake rate", "updated_at": "1479301182", "user": "VinInn"}

The average displacement becomes smaller and the slope in the central region becomes larger.\r\nIn order to correct for the displacement around central region, Morris proposed to evaluate the LA at depth T/2 and obtain tan\\theta_L = 2(D_1/2)/T as shown in green, which helps to monitor displacement of charge carriers around central region and thus is better for calibration purpose.\r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/CMSTrackerDPG/cmssw/files/7552567/LA_irradiated.pdf\r\n\r\n<img width=\"654\" alt=\"LAIrradiated\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5064110/143324777-e0d7ddd4-2f6c-442f-a2ec-03252c1cd675.png\">\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\ncode compiles\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nWould be nice to have it in 12_1_X T0 replay\r\n\r\nSubmitting the PR for @wweiphy ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 12, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1637777436", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["alca-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "bug-fix", "requires-external", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_2_X", "number": 36241, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Modify calculations for the SiPixel Lorentz Angle calibration in PCL", "updated_at": "1637850237", "user": "tvami"}

In my analysis framework, I would like to recompute this bitset to get all the IDs in the same way, even when the sample was older or does not have all the IDs set yet. In the current CMSSW code, you can't compute the ID bitset without setting the bitset of the muon. That's inconvenient if all you have are `const` references to the muons and you have no desire to change that, so I changed that in my analysis branch.\r\n\r\nMaybe this change can also be done in master so other analyzers might profit as well? Thanks!\r\n\r\n[1] https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/SWGuideMuonIdRun2#Muon_selectors_Since_9_4_X", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1547763272", "deletions": 10, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "code-checks-pending", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_5_X", "number": 25698, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Allow calculation of muon ID bitset from const reference to muon", "updated_at": "1547763334", "user": "guitargeek"}

After that, the even and odd amplitudes are compared with 12 bits precision (only in the EB Fenix TCP board) to determine the double weights flags. \r\n\r\nIn the emulator the saturation was not checked at that stage and therefore the even/odd comparison was performed with 18 bits precision. \r\n\r\nThis was causing data/emulator discrepancy in the saturated TPs observed during double weights test with splashes events in April. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1654768866", "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1654599792", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["l1-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "5ab4932354eaf5d5924b9309bf9b6fe393a23686", "merged_at": "1654768866", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 38272, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix ECAL TPG emulator discrepancy for saturated strips", "updated_at": "1654768867", "user": "valsdav"}

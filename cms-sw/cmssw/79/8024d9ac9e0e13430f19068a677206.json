It was checked that all newly added dependencies are actually required by the package with `git grep`.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 9, "closed_at": "1600348474", "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1600279570", "deletions": 18, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "generators-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "568a8c45a800b9465f297a1ae118967a3c806aa9", "merged_at": "1600348474", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 31488, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Clean BuildFiles in GeneratorInterface part 2", "updated_at": "1600348475", "user": "guitargeek"}

The easiest way to fix the test errors is to use classes_def.xml and classes.h consistently throughout the framework for generating ROOT6 dictionaries.\nSome minor refactoring of code in IOPool/TFileAdaptor was needed to do this.\nWhile we could in principle do the same for ROOT 5, this is non-trivial in ROOT5 because two of the classes in question inherit from TObject.  Because of the complexities of CINT, Cintex, and Reflex, additional work would be needed for ROOT5.\nThis pull request fixes many framework unit test errors against ROOT6.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_ROOT6_X", "changed_files": 9, "closed_at": "1387396344", "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1387395229", "deletions": 63, "labels": ["core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "9516760535c20b4ba9a0b92b8446fa869c6b547a", "merged_at": "1387396344", "merged_by": "ktf", "number": 1881, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Avoid linkDef files for root6", "updated_at": "1406911340", "user": "wmtan"}

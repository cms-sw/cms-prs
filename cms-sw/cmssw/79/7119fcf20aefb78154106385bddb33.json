This has been tested with the upgrade WF (both 2023tilted and 2023GReco) for different samples.\nIt is just a first preliminary set up in order to introduce the OT clusters and recHits, so further improvements and factorization are expected when also the new phase2 pixel cluster recHits will be introduced ( @atricomi @emiglior ).\nTests have been also run for the run2 WF standard list. No changes is expected.\n\nStill to do:\n- setting up validation tools (short term)\n- importing phase2 CPE from external package (short term)\n- phase2 pixel clusters and recHits\n- using stacks in the tracking reconstruction\n\n@VinInn @rovere @boudoul @delaere \n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 50, "closed_at": "1464184326", "comments": 30, "commits": 18, "created_at": "1463922913", "deletions": 252, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "b6c342230bc53b972850a57ef60a321514a259f7", "merged_at": "1464184326", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 14598, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 19, "state": "closed", "title": "Phase2 tracking reconstruction in 81X", "updated_at": "1464184326", "user": "ebrondol"}

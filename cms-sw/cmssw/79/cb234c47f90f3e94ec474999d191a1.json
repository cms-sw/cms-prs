This causes a fatal error with new ROOT6 code (not yet in the IB) that unloads plugins when TFileAdaptor is later enabled.\nThis fix moves the opening and closing of the conditions data file to after TFileAdaptor is enabled, thereby avioding the problem.\nPlease merge this promptly unless there are issues.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_ROOT6_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1397530257", "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1397519043", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "core-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "e1097c688ec23a2b635fec811723cd966ae4cac5", "merged_at": "1397530257", "merged_by": "ktf", "number": 3337, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Open and close conditions file after TFileAdaptor is enabled", "updated_at": "1404395907", "user": "wmtan"}

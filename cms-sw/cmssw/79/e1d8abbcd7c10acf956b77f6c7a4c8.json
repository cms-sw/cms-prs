HCAL DPG is currently using hcalNano to process MC for several important activities, but we don't have an official workflow built into CMSSW for this at the moment. So, this PR would help HCAL DPG by keeping an official recipe built into CMSSW.\r\n\r\nNo backport is needed.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested the new code and worflow using this command:\r\n`runTheMatrix.py -l 2500.251 -w nano --ibeos`\r\nand the output hcalNano looks good.\r\n\r\n#### Note:\r\nAs noted in a comment in the code, some labels in the runTheMatrix code specify the CMSSW release 14_0, but this new workflow is actually using a sample generated using 14_2. This is just for the consistency of the names, but I could update the naming conventions if anyone has a preference (just please let me know what names are suggested.)\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1736882760", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "tests-rejected", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-approved", "xpog-pending", "hcal"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_0_X", "number": 47102, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "HcalNano for MC", "updated_at": "1737044246", "user": "jhakala"}

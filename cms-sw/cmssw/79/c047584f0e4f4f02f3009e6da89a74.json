Now if the run is low statistics for pixel, such as cosmic run, DQM plot for prompt reconstruction will be corrected filled instead of empty.\r\n  ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 8, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1535956386", "deletions": 64, "labels": ["alca-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_3_X", "number": 24439, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "SiPixelQuality PCL bug fix", "updated_at": "1535976900", "user": "tocheng"}

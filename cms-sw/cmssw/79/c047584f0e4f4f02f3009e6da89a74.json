Now if the run is low statistics for pixel, such as cosmic run, DQM plot for prompt reconstruction will be corrected filled instead of empty.\r\n  ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1536215878", "comments": 11, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1535956386", "deletions": 64, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "6ccd790ca32339f8337a121311912287484d2466", "merged_at": "1536215878", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_3_X", "number": 24439, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "SiPixelQuality PCL bug fix", "updated_at": "1536215878", "user": "tocheng"}

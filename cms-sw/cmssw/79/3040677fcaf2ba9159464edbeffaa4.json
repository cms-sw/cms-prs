Well, I couldn't find any and I don't think it's even possible because the HIPhotonIsolation is a custom class. Hence, we can't use the existing mechanisms for `int` and `float` ValueMaps.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, this PR proposes the solution via editing the ReducedEGProducer source.\r\n\r\n@mandrenguyen @ttrk \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCMSSW compiles, local matrix tests pass.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nNo backport intened.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1608340108", "comments": 23, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1607878870", "deletions": 50, "labels": ["bug-fix", "code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "d495a3c230fef1d5c520a1a8a04d703bee49d40c", "merged_at": "1608340108", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 32462, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 11, "state": "closed", "title": "Correctly add HIPhotonIsolation to pat::photon", "updated_at": "1608340108", "user": "guitargeek"}

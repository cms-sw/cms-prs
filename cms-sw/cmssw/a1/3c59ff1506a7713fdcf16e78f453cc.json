The correct product type is edm::ValueMap&lt;float&gt;, not double.\nThis was not caught because the helper functions involved use getByLabel, not getByToken.  These helper classes use edm::EventBase, rather than edm::Event, and getByToken() is not implemented for edm::EventBase.  Fixing this larger issue is outside the scope of this bug fix.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1429761128", "comments": 12, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1429638437", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "ab3a9aebaaf5e807c8dd684f4a659c9d77ab01aa", "merged_at": "1429761128", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 8816, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Use correct type for consumes declaration", "updated_at": "1431031391", "user": "wmtan"}

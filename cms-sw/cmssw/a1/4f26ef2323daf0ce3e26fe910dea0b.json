If the `doReverse` parameter is true, the opposite action is performed. \r\n   * `SiStripApvGainInspector`: this module allows redo the per-APV gain fits with different PDFs (landau, landau + gaus convolution, etc.) starting from the Charge vs APV index plot produced in the SiStrip G2 APV gain PCL workflow. It is possible to inspect the 1D charge distributions for certain APVs after fitting by means of specifying them via the parameter `selectedModules`.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRelies on the unit tests provided here: `scram b runtests_testSiStripGainsManinpulation` runs fine with this branch.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

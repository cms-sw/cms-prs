Currently, the framework is focused on dijet topologies, but the eventual aim is to extend this to other event selections as well. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis code has been used for studies shown in the PF and PPD meetings ([https://indico.cern.ch/event/1437831/](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1437831/)), with results that look reasonable. I have also run the basic code quality checks for CMSSW.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 8, "comments": 1, "commits": 9, "created_at": "1723065790", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "new-package-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 45667, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Adding code for Particle Flow DQM ", "updated_at": "1723065819", "user": "jroloff"}

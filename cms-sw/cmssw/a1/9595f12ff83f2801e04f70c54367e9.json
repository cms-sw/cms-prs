Currently, the framework is focused on dijet topologies, but the eventual aim is to extend this to other event selections as well. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis code has been used for studies shown in the PF and PPD meetings ([https://indico.cern.ch/event/1437831/](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1437831/)), with results that look reasonable.

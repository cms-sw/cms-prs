Commit (1) will be important for any sequence involving the EMTF unpacker in run 315623, and future runs after we update the EMTF firmware to write out the CPPF link status.  So both of these at least need to go to Tier-0, I guess.  @rekovic any thoughts on the proper procedure here?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nAndrew\r\n\r\n** Accidentally also had some commits trying to fix EMTF O2O issues, reverted.

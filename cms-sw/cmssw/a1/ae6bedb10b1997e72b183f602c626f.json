Since people often want/need to access supercluster eta, I find it an unnecessary complication to have to derive it from `deltaEtaSC` and `eta`. Therefore, I propose to add the actual `superclusterEta`, which is already there for photons. Since `superclusterEta` was also there in the additional table used for EGMNano, I have removed it from there. For the moment, I would keep `deltaEtaSC` just so that people using 2024 prompt nanos won't have to make uncomfortable adjustments to their code to pick another variable in the middle of the dataset.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe new variable, `superclusterEta`, now appears in the standard Nano files and behaves as expected.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with any link to the master PR, or the intended backport release cycle numbers -->\r\n\r\nIf possible, I would like to have it backported to 140X to make it effective in prompt and in the 2024 MC production.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 4, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1723644204", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "xpog-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 45703, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Add electron supercluster eta to NanoAOD content", "updated_at": "1723644415", "user": "RSalvatico"}

Concern mostly the SLHCUpgradeSimulations/L1TrackTrigger package :\n- for the code and algorithms that we had already in the release : update to the latest\n  version, as used to make the plots in the Technical Proposal and for the SD studies\n- new files, that contain the first version of the FPGA emulation code of the tracklet-L1Tracking\n  for CMSSW. These new files are named FPGAxxx. Some corresponding updates in a few files \n  in SimDataFormats/SLHC/interface (L1TStub.hh and slhcevent.hh) \n- there is also a minor fix in \n  SLHCUpgradeSimulations/L1CaloTrigger/python/SLHCCaloTrigger_forTTI_cff.py\n", "branch": "CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "changed_files": 88, "closed_at": "1458811196", "comments": 3, "commits": 41, "created_at": "1449415559", "deletions": 1532, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "l1-pending", "new-package-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "Next CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "number": 12682, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Tti 62 x track trigger objects", "updated_at": "1458811197", "user": "EmanuelPerez"}

Printing out the `name` helped to point the actual problem (*). I thought adding the `name` to the exception message would help such investigations next time.\r\n\r\n(*) the code used `edm::EDGetTokenT` instead of `device::EDGetToken` in an Alpaka module, that then lead to our check of \"all consumed data types must have a dictionary\" to make ROOT to auto-parse the headers, because the consumed (but incorrect!) type indeed did not have a dictionary\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nChecked the exception message in the example job. The added information would have immediately pointed towards the culprit.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 10, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1711570498", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 44564, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "If `TClass::GetClass()` fails in `TypeWithDict::byName()`, include the argument class name in the exception message", "updated_at": "1711630725", "user": "makortel"}

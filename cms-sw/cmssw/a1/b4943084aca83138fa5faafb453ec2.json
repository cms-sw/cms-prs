The motivation is to decouple initialStep seed initial kinematics from beamspot position (e.g. to avoid possible bias in beamspot determination itself).\r\n\r\nHere are MTV plots with 1000 ttbar+PU35 events in 9_0_0_pre4+#17537+#17511+#17544 (effectively pre5 tracking)\r\nhttps://mkortela.web.cern.ch/mkortela/tracking/validation/CMSSW_9_0_0_pre4_phase1ConsecutiveHitsTripletOnlySeedCreator/\r\nfor both CA seeding and old seeding. There are small variations (most notably some migration of tracks from initialStep to lowPtQuadStep).\r\n\r\nTested in 9_0_0_pre5, expecting tiny changes in phase1 tracking as shown above (no changes in phase0/2).\r\n\r\n@rovere @VinInn @felicepantaleo ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1490678374", "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1489738133", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "99c62e78a8e2f33a4bb5d4b73af2ee1b3aca8592", "merged_at": "1490678374", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_1_X", "number": 17964, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Switch phase1 initialStep seed creator to ConsecutiveHitsTripletOnly", "updated_at": "1490678374", "user": "makortel"}

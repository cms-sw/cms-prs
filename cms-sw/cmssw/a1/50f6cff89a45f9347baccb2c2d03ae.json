This new configuration, developed by @pauris123 , differs from V2 for the crystal thickness, set everywhere to 3.75 mm, as it will be in reality (purchase order ongoing). This is the opportunity to drop the crystal thickness from the geometry construction, and have 6 equal readout units along z. \r\n\r\nThe numbering scheme for the time being is just adapted to the existing ```BTLDetId```, creating an effective crystal thickness index, so as to postpone the major update to the moment in which the BTL V1 can be finally dropped, allowing us to optimize the bit fields structure for a final configuration.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nAll basic geometry checks (when geometry scenario is adapted) look reasonable, and a complete workflow runs. No overlap is detected at ideal geometry level, and visual inspection in fireworks appears ok.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 17, "closed_at": "1702555961", "comments": 9, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1702394335", "deletions": 46, "labels": ["geometry-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "upgrade-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "34f4fe8e579d09485d0654dbd031dd1ce31943d4", "merged_at": "1702555961", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "number": 43553, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "MTD geometry: add BTL V3 (one crystal thickness only) to MTD scenario I17 (global scenario D105)", "updated_at": "1702555961", "user": "fabiocos"}

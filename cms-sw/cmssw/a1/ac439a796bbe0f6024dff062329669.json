This lead to a problem\nwhen the same EDProducer was on a Path and an EndPath. This would cause the\nEDProducer to be removed from the Path but left on the EndPath so the EDProducer\nwould remain scheduled. If modules on a Path needed the results from that\nEDProducer they would fail to get those products.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1456303077", "comments": 10, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1456146448", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["comparison-available", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "192b359db89a807079a46d67d672a5602a7b8cff", "merged_at": "1456303077", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 13427, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Clean EndPaths as well when going unscheduled", "updated_at": "1459168172", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

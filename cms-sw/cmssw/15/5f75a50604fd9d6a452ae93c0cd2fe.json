It adds a configuration option `putEmptyIfMaxElementReached` (better name welcome)  to `HitPairEDProducer` (defaults to `false`), that will make the `HitPairEDProducer` to \"abort\" the processing and put empty data products into the Event also in the case where any layer pair yields more doublets than the `maxElement` threshold, in addition of the condition of the total number of doublets from all layer pairs reaching `maxElementTotal`.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nIn addition to https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/41514, code compiles\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

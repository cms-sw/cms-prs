This will reduce slightly the footprint of the GsfElectron collection. \r\n\r\nThis PR provides an incremental (1-line) change on top of CMSSW_10_5_X_2019-02-18-2300, which includes already #25960.\r\n\r\nThis bug fix, along with the changes in #25960, will be back ported to 10.2.X. These changes will invalidate the BDT model used for the ID in cms-data/RecoEgamma-ElectronIdentification#13. However, this model can be, and will be, retrained on MINIAOD inputs at a later date. \r\n\r\n@mverzett @nancymarinelli @gkaratha ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 16, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1550570301", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_5_X", "number": 25974, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Low pT electrons: bug fix for SuperCluster class", "updated_at": "1550592818", "user": "bainbrid"}

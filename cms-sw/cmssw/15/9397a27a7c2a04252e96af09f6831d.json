This fixes puppet behavior in gamma+jets events where isolated high pT photons get weight 0. The code works by setting the weight weight of all associated pfcandidates to the designated puppiweight (1, but its configurable). This will allow for improved electron and photon isolation since an improved footprint removal can be done. \n\nAn example of the inteded use in puppet is shown in the test config. \n\n@nhanvtran @hsatoshi\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1454480550", "comments": 12, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1454373624", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "e740d7bb193454e9f5c150fc8055ec1ccdcf4171", "merged_at": "1454480550", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 13157, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 10, "state": "closed", "title": "Added code to set isolated Photon puppi weight to 1 for loose id photons above 10 GeV", "updated_at": "1454480550", "user": "violatingcp"}

For previous scenarios and BTL the code has been left so far unchanged to make backward compatibility easier;\r\n\r\n- proton production cuts have been added (equal to electron cuts) as pointed by @ianna . The separation of BTL and ETL cuts, and the update of ETL cuts will be done in a separated PR;\r\n\r\n- ETLDetId has been updated by adding one more constructor, dedicated to the new ETL design.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe test class ```TestMTDPosition``` has been further updated, and all the test classes have been run to ensure that scenario D50 is left unchanged. The assignment of DetIds and corresponding definition of ```GeometricTimingDets``` in the scenario D53 appears consistent with the design implemented by @icosivi .", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 14, "closed_at": "1584550930", "comments": 20, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1584286023", "deletions": 85, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "5d92dcea12100567464a9287edc48fea9200c7e7", "merged_at": "1584550929", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 29207, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "MTD geometry: updates of xml and RECO geometry for new TDR ETL", "updated_at": "1584550930", "user": "fabiocos"}

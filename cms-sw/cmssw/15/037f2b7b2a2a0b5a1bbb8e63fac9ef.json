The Scale and Smearing will be apply offline on the Ecal-Tracker combined energy (instead of the Ecal energy and redo the combination for electrons) as it is done in Run3.\r\n- Update EPcombination parameters used for combination  when applying S&S on the Ecal energy. Not used anymore (see first bullet) but the wrong set of parameters was used.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested using https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/48176#issuecomment-2909918885\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

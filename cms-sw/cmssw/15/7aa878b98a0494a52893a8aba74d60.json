This modules makes a copy of the tracker-driven electron seeds while replacing in each seed,\nthe reference to the \"before mixing\" track with a reference to the corresponding \"after mixing\" track.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": "1426146530", "comments": 22, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1425887150", "deletions": 11, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fastsim-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "146a894f6776cf7fba883bc650bd229f4bcb1cb1", "merged_at": "1426146530", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 8143, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "Fastsim fix ele track ref", "updated_at": "1436781660", "user": "lveldere"}

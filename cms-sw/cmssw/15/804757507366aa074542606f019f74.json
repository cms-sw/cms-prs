To activate this iteration a flag is added in order to be able to turn off this part of the code and don't interfere with the current algorithm. These [slides](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/files/8770320/HLT-Muon-Displaced_2022-05-25.pdf) contain information regarding the problem that we observed and this solution. In slide 7, the performance is shown (compare yellow and brown histograms) and more information regarding the rates and timing is in the backup.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nPR validated in #38076 \r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nbackport of #38076  \r\nBackport needed for HLT during 2022 pp data-taking.\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1654297746", "comments": 12, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1653979702", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["hlt-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "backport-ok"], "merge_commit_sha": "fcd6970b145217f25b84e916cacffc122dabbaac", "merged_at": "1654297746", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 38137, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Implemented new strategy to generate OI seeds for displaced muons (backport)", "updated_at": "1654297746", "user": "alexsr-98"}

After having tested the effect of its backport https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/41879 into the CMSSW_13_0_X branch (via a [replay of CMSSW_13_0_7_patch1](https://github.com/dmwm/T0/pull/4838) and having checked the output at [1]) it became apparent that few of the ME-s introduced in #41879 are not useful, as they are produced in the harvesting step:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/2a83dec349e4276b8feddee48992423ad657e8a7/DQMOffline/Trigger/python/TrackingMonitoring_Client_cff.py#L32-L59\r\n\r\nand as such cannot be saved per-LS basis at the DQM first step. \r\nThis PR is technically a no-op, since it's not affecting anything at any level, but I have been requested to clean-up the file to remove possible sources of confusion later on.  \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nValidated in master.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nverbatim backport of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/41937 for data-taking purposes.\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1686753677", "deletions": 8, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "backport-ok"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "number": 41966, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "remove tracking efficiency and fake rate w.r.t. offline plots from list of ME to be outputed by LS [13.0.X]", "updated_at": "1686753699", "user": "mmusich"}

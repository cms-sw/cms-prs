The main interface\nchange is to require a StreamID or LuminosityBlockIndex\nargument to the getEngine function. In most cases,\nthis required moving code from the constructor to\nthe event or beginLuminosityBlock method. Then a pointer\nto the engine was percolated or passed in some way\nto the point where it was used.\n\nIn some cases, I added declarations of shared resources\nwhere it was obvious they were needed, but I did not\nthoroughly check for and declare all shared resources\nthat will eventually be needed.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "changed_files": 99, "closed_at": "1390401478", "comments": 15, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1389300368", "deletions": 533, "labels": ["core-pending", "generators-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-rejected"], "milestone": "CMSSW_7_1_0_pre1", "number": 1982, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Migrate Generators to New Random Service Interface", "updated_at": "1402634214", "user": "wddgit"}

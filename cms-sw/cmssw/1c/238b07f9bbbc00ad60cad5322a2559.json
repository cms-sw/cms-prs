For example, this is needed for correctly filtering  events of the `DYJetsToTauTauToMuTauh_M-50` sample. The proposed changes were discussed in the TauPOG here: https://indico.cern.ch/event/1170879/#2-validation-of-exclusive-dy-t\r\n\r\nWe have also added the absolute value function around the mother's PDG ID to allow for charged bosons, such as W (24) for H  WW.\r\n\r\n### PR validation\r\n* We have compared MC events generated with and without the changes to this filter.\r\n* Usual `scram build code-checks` and `scram build code-format`.\r\n\r\n### PR backporting\r\nAfter PR, we will request to backport these changes to `CMSSW_10_6_X` as well, so we can regenerate the `DYJetsToTauTauToMuTauh_M-50` sample for Run-2 UL MC for TauPOG studies, and also to the CMSSW version for the future Run-3 MC campaign.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1660657580", "comments": 17, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1658467656", "deletions": 11, "labels": ["generators-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "8ab71973700700253a757afee5fba843db7bd6e3", "merged_at": "1660657580", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 38829, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 4, "state": "closed", "title": "Add DY option to Embedding HepMC filter", "updated_at": "1660657581", "user": "IzaakWN"}

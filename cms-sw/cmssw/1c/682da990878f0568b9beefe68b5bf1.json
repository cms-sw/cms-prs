This generates a data file containing a SiStripApproximateClusterCollection object with known content. Then it reads it. It verifies that when we read it we obtain values that match the known written values for all the data fields in the object. In particular all containers have content so all contained types are also read.\r\n\r\nIt also reads the old files in the DataFormats/SiStripCluster data repository which are listed in the shell script. The plan is that each time the data format of SiStripApproximateClusterCollection is modified a file will added.\r\n\r\nThere is a slight modification to the constructor of SiStripApproximateCluster, but it is only used in the test.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis only adds a unit test in DataFormats/SiStripCluster which passes. It shouldn't affect anything else.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 8, "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1695652385", "deletions": 8, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "requires-external", "code-checks-approved", "trk"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_3_X", "number": 42859, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Add unit test for SiStripApproximateClusterCollection format", "updated_at": "1695656835", "user": "wddgit"}

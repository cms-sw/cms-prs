This is to avoid cases where a signal is thrown while parts of ROOT or the message logger have already been deallocated. This also avoids a problem happening in the threaded build were jemalloc causes a signal while it is still holding its internal lock and then the complex signal handler asks jemalloc for more memory and the program deadlocks.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1390245479", "comments": 6, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1390165594", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "b5c3c207d78dc5edf08cf5bc52b9e2cbe64ac369", "merged_at": "1390245479", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_1_0_pre1", "number": 2078, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Use simple signal handlers at exit", "updated_at": "1402599353", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

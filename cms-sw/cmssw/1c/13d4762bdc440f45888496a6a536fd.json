Notable changes:\r\n- data / MC flag which is autodetected in case of data conversion into raw (FRD) format. For HLT it was requested to have this feature for MWGRs / Hilton tests\r\n- support reading TCDS record from a range of FED IDs. MiniDAQs is the primary target to benefit from it with 11_1_X (likely to stay with this release series longer than Central DAQ) and will allow their data to have proper event ID instead of current 24-bit one which wraps frequently.\r\n- additional modes used for the input source reading the new raw FRD format with file header. Allows format to be used with file locking (e.g. in Hilton if FRD rawa dat is produced as the new format).\r\n- bugfixes for some modes of input source reading (although not default in production system).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested in DAQ VM test cluster (applied to CMSSW_11_1_4)\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nBackport of 11_2_X:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/30206\r\nhttps://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/30457 (except DataFormats/TCDS changes)\r\nhttps://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/31543\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "changed_files": 17, "closed_at": "1603971904", "comments": 21, "commits": 25, "created_at": "1603886350", "deletions": 149, "labels": ["comparison-available", "core-approved", "daq-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "969ba6921389a1b3f968407e6b7178adeb8ba7a3", "merged_at": "1603971904", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 31964, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "DAQ backport (11_1_X)", "updated_at": "1603971905", "user": "smorovic"}

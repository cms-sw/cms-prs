Turning the former EgammaHadTower helper class (that took the EventSetup as a constructor argument) to free functions that take the ES products directly would remove one of these abstraction layers, making it simpler to migrate some of electron and photon reconstruction plugins.\r\n\r\nAnother helper class that also makes use of EgammaHadTower is the ElectronHcalHelper, which is now using the ESGetTokens.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nLocal matrix tests pass.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nNo backport intended.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 40, "closed_at": "1603298690", "comments": 48, "commits": 8, "created_at": "1602078859", "deletions": 357, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "hlt-approved", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "971861d38604a0f850d2067d78082eaa43276941", "merged_at": "1603298690", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 31700, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 7, "state": "closed", "title": "Adapt EgammaHadTower and ElectronHcalHelper classes to use ESGetToken", "updated_at": "1603298690", "user": "guitargeek"}

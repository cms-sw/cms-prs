The `@relval2023` alias is redirected to the 2023-V1.1 frozen menu (as usual for closed releases, the appropriate frozen HLT menu, when available, is used in RelVals wfs).\r\n\r\nIn addition, the `era` used for the `L1REPACK` and `(HLT+)RECO` steps in the HLT-Validation tests and HLT-addon tests is changed from `Run3` to `Run3_2023` (see https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/41271). This is done mainly to follow what currently runs in the prompt offline reconstruction of 2023 data.\r\n\r\nThis update includes the integration of the following JIRA tickets.\r\n\r\n - [CMSHLT-2695](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSHLT-2695): [HIG] new HH4b triggers for `ParkingHH` dataset\r\n - [CMSHLT-2697](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSHLT-2697): [HIG] retuning of `HLT_Diphoton30_18_R9IdL*` triggers\r\n - [CMSHLT-2702](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSHLT-2702): [HIG,EXO] new triggers for VBF parking\r\n - [CMSHLT-2734](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSHLT-2734): [HIG] addition of `HLT_Photon60_*_PFJetsMJJ300DEta3_v` to EGamma PD(s)\r\n - [CMSHLT-2743](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSHLT-2743): [EXO] displaced-jets triggers for LLP parking\r\n - [CMSHLT-2744](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSHLT-2744): [EXO] delayed-jets triggers for LLP parking\r\n - [CMSHLT-2747](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSHLT-2747): [HCAL] increase HB-RecHit thresholds for 2023 data-taking\r\n - [CMSHLT-2748](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSHLT-2748): [JME,HCAL] replace `L1_SingleJet35*` seeds with `L1_ZeroBias` in triggers of GRun menu\r\n - [CMSHLT-2750](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSHLT-2750): [HIG] correct bugged instances of `HLTPFJetTag` in MSSM-Hbb triggers\r\n - [CMSHLT-2754](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSHLT-2754): [EXO] delayed-jet and delayed-photon triggers for \"satellite\" collisions\r\n - [CMSHLT-2756](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSHLT-2756): [MUO] update of muon-InsideOut seed-classifier BDT training and wp for 2023\r\n - [CMSHLT-2759](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSHLT-2759): [HIG,B2G] PNet trainings for 2023 and update of PNet-WPs in all PNet-based triggers\r\n - [CMSHLT-2760](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSHLT-2760): [HCAL] removal of `HLT_HcalIsolatedbunch_v` trigger and `IsolatedBunch` dataset\r\n - [CMSHLT-2772](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSHLT-2772): [HIG] additional control triggers for VBF HToCC search\r\n - [CMSHLT-2780](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSHLT-2780): [HIG,B2G,TOP] move some HT+Jet+BTag triggers to `ParkingHH` dataset\r\n - [CMSHLT-2791](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSHLT-2791): [EXO] set PS=0 for `HLT_HT200_L1SingleLLPJet_DisplacedDijet35_Inclusive1PtrkShortSig5_v`\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTSG tests.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

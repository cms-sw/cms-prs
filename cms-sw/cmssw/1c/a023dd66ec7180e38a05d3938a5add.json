Only the latter contains photons in the shashlik device.\n\nThis can be put in a patch release since it only edits .cc and python.\n\n@nancymarinelli @dbenedet @matteosan1\n", "branch": "CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1407365872", "comments": 2, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1407315536", "deletions": 11, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "5c918c9c7a5efbda31251cd7469d156c06521985", "merged_at": "1407365872", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "number": 4888, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Shashlik Fixes -> re-add ECAL driven seeding + split off mustache photons", "updated_at": "1407365872", "user": "lgray"}

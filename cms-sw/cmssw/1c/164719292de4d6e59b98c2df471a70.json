This histogram is sensitive to the list of triggers in the HLT menu, and it has led to confusion in #40700. In my opinion, this histogram is not helpful in this part of the DQM (the HLT outputs are already monitored by other dedicated DQM plugins).\r\n\r\nMerely technical. No changes expected, except for the removal of the histogram in question.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

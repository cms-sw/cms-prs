Nor may it\nbe desirable for the workflow layers to enable lazy-download for\nall merges (as some sites don't have the disk space).\n\nThis patch allows us to selectively turn on lazy-download only for\nmerge jobs at a given site by editing site-local-config.xml.\n\nThis commit is a cherry-pick of the b19f156f954152ff741226a3c2600fade3e95397 in 7_3_X.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_2_X", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": "1416327392", "comments": 12, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1416319093", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["comparison-available", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "e9b4c96d68267d34e55594efb197d74b0ca985a5", "merged_at": "1416327392", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_2_X", "number": 6478, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Provide the ability to do a separate cache-hint for cloning.", "updated_at": "1416327392", "user": "bbockelm"}

This means that in the generic validation the harvesting for this folder cannot occur, as the folder is not created.\r\nI solve this issue by creating two clones: `postProcessorTrackStandalone` and `postProcessorTrackSummaryStandalone`  adding the `Tracking/TrackBHadron/*` to the folders to harvest and using them in the new sequence: `postProcessorTrackSequenceStandalone`.\r\nThis sequence will be used for the standalone usage by:\r\n```\r\ncmsDriver.py step4 ... -s HARVESTING:postProcessorTrackSequenceStandalone --filetype DQM --filein file:step3_inDQM.root\r\n```\r\nThe twiki page at this [link](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/SWGuideMultiTrackValidator#cmsDriver_MTV_alone_i_e_standalo) will be adjusted once this PR is merged.\r\n\r\nI profit of this PR to clean some other warnings related to missing folder in the case of `fastSim`  (commit 0f96a9f) \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nPasses:\r\n```\r\nrunTheMatrix.py -l limited -t 4 -j  8\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nThis PR is not a backport, and no backport is needed.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1602832413", "comments": 38, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1602666781", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "d7743065b0eedde7c6ff876f36fecfb95f04b8c2", "merged_at": "1602832413", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 31785, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 4, "state": "closed", "title": "Tracking Validation: fix some more warnings (Tracking/TrackBHadron)", "updated_at": "1602832413", "user": "mmusich"}

It was noticed that, in this process, ordering of some egamma modules got shuffled unintentionally. That was partly fixed by https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/44523.\r\nThis is a followup PR to further fix the remaining issues, and implement a proper ordering of modules in egamma paths. The ordering is important to keep timing under control. The idea is to run less expensive sequences in the beginning, followed by relevant filters and then then move on to run more expensive sequences. This is what has always been done in egamma, in phase1 and also in phase2 HLT.  \r\n\r\nAs an example, in HLT_Ele32 path (which has the highest rate among all egamma paths), the following ordering is reintroduced via this PR:  \r\n\r\n```\r\nRun L1 sequence\r\nL1 filter    \r\nECAL and HGCAL local reco + clustering + superclustering\r\nCut on supercluster ET\r\nProduce ECAL sigmaIEtaIEta, and cut on it \r\nProduce HGCAL ID variables,  and cut on them  \r\nHCAL local reco\r\nFastJet Sequence (needed for rho correction)\r\nProduce H/E in barrel, cut on that\r\nProduce ECAL isolation, cut on that\r\nProduce HGCAL isolation, cut on that\r\nRun PF clustering in HCAL\r\nProduce HCAL PF cluster based isolation, and cut on that\r\nRun Pixel Match Sequence\r\nPixel matching related filters\r\nGsfElectron Sequence\r\nCut on GSF related variables\r\nProduce Track isolation using L1 tracks, and cut on that\r\nRun general tracking\r\nProduce track isolation using HLT tracks, and cut on that\r\n```\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nPhase2 menu runs.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 18, "comments": 6, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1712072889", "deletions": 251, "labels": ["hlt-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "bug-fix", "code-checks-approved", "egamma"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 44592, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Fix ordering of egamma HLT modules", "updated_at": "1712073507", "user": "swagata87"}

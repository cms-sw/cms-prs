The check turns out to be flawed, instead the `BranchDescription`s from earlier/other Processes need to be ignored. There were also two other places that were missing a check of the process name.\r\n\r\nThe bug was noticed as a unit test failure in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/27983#issuecomment-610398078\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nFramework unit tests run.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1587395897", "comments": 25, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1586383250", "deletions": 8, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "f23f5b0bfe26c05ce9bd4782ddb1601ab3db4ba5", "merged_at": "1587395897", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 29435, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 14, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix SwitchProducer for products from earlier processes", "updated_at": "1587395898", "user": "makortel"}

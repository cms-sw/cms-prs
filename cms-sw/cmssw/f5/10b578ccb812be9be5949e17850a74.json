There could be many minbias files, so the input source needs to open each file one at a time until it finds the correct file.  This feature replaces class CrossingFramePlaybackInfoExtended with class CrossingFramePlaybackInfoNew.\nThe new class contains a hash of the logical file name for each playback event, in principle enabling the source to open only the correct file.   CrossingFramePlaybackInfoExtended is kept read only for backward compatibility only.  The pull request also replaces the vector of a vector of a vector (no kidding) used in CrossingFramePlaybackInfoExtended with a flat vector in CrossingFramePlaybackInfoNew.\nThis request has been successfully tested with relval 200.  However, since this test uses only one playback file. it is not sufficient testing to ensure functionality.\nSo, the requestors of this feature (Yetkin Yilmaz et. al.) need to test this or provide some tests.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 42, "closed_at": "1425753269", "comments": 42, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1423077375", "deletions": 262, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "core-approved", "dqm-approved", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "0312a7373cd60b7c2e0f7f6b44ed402d5b92e075", "merged_at": "1425753269", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 7564, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 5, "state": "closed", "title": "File information in playback info", "updated_at": "1426176673", "user": "wmtan"}

The code creates tracks using two hits (one per plane) drawing a straight line between them. The track is required to be isolated and horizontal. The goal is to recover at least some proton tracks for alignment/debugging purposes.\r\nThe patch is enabled by means of a runtime flag. Run2 processes are protected via Era mechanism.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRun2 data show no difference. Preliminary run3 data show recovered tracks as expected.\r\n\r\nThis PR is a backport of PR#38553.\r\n\r\n@jpata @grzanka @AndreaBellora\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": "1657847207", "comments": 45, "commits": 9, "created_at": "1656680607", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["dqm-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "bug-fix", "orp-approved", "urgent", "backport-ok", "ctpps"], "merge_commit_sha": "69f091ea41e5d4d42530a2f5440e08a73127011f", "merged_at": "1657847207", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 38581, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "[12_4_X] PPS reco patch for bad pot", "updated_at": "1657847207", "user": "fabferro"}

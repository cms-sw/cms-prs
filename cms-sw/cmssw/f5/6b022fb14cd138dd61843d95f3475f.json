The code creates tracks using two hits (one per plane) drawing a straight line between them. The track is required to be isolated and horizontal. The goal is to recover at least some proton tracks for alignment/debugging purposes.\r\nThe patch is enabled by means of a runtime flag. Run2 processes are protected via Era mechanism.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRun2 data show no difference. Preliminary run3 data show recovered tracks as expected.\r\n\r\nThis PR is a backport of PR#38553.\r\n\r\n@jpata @grzanka @AndreaBellora\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "changed_files": 5, "comments": 1, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1656680607", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 38581, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[12_4_X] PPS reco patch for bad pot", "updated_at": "1656680632", "user": "fabferro"}

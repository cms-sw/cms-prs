This commit makes `operator()` private in the context of emission\r\nwhile still allowing its use for connection.\r\n\r\nHaving emit calls explicit in the framework code allows easier location of signals emission, and easier context checking.\r\n\r\nThe bulk of this PR is in `FWCore/Utilities/interface/Signal.h`. The rests is just the conversion from`operator()` to `emit()`\r\nas a consequence.\r\n\r\nThis is a technical change that does not affect the behavior of the code.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis has been used for validating profiler services development (for a different PR) without any noticeable changes in\r\nbehavior. Re compiling the ~900 affected modules (as this is touching FWCore) went fine.\r\n\r\nThis PR does not change physics code.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 27, "comments": 14, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1765272221", "deletions": 155, "labels": ["core-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved", "ngt"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_0_X", "number": 49577, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Use of emit() instead of operator() for signals emission.", "updated_at": "1765808587", "user": "ericcano"}

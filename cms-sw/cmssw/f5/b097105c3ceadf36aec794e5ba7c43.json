This brings them both into line.  I've done this in a functional way so that it works for both \"gctDigis\" -> \"simGctDigis\" (Run 1); and \"caloStage1LegacyFormatDigis\" -> \"simCaloStage1LegacyFormatDigis\" (Run 2).  If preferred I could keep the Run 1 lines the same and add\n\n```\neras.stage1L1Trigger.toModify( l1extraParticles, etTotalSource = cms.InputTag(\"simCaloStage1LegacyFormatDigis\") )\n```\n\netcetera.\n\n**Note there is still a difference between the era and the customisation**\nIn the customisation, `process.misalignedCSCGeometry.useGangedStripsInME1a` is True whereas in the era it's False.  I'm pretty sure the value for the era is correct, and the customisation wrong.  Could someone from FastSim confirm?\n\nI've done a comparison of how the config for era differs to customisations in workflows 5.1, 5.2, 135.1 and 135.4 here:\n\nhttp://grimes.web.cern.ch/grimes/eraProcessDiffs/processDiffs_FastSim-7_6_X_2015-09-30-1100-PR11466-mark-grimes_fixRun2EraInFastSim.html\n\nThe 5.x tests show nothing there because they're exactly the same.  Don't worry `outputCommands` \"unexpected\" difference, the commands are just in a different order but functionally the same.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1444032398", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1443643213", "deletions": 15, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fastsim-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "cc6c3d204f6561158e0a78aac3b52efa968e6146", "merged_at": "1444032398", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 11583, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Update Run 2 eras to configure FastSim properly", "updated_at": "1444037438", "user": "mark-grimes"}

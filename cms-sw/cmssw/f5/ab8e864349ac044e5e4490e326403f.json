Full description of the original PR is repeated below for convenience.\r\n\r\nThis PR adapts DeepTauId producer to a new v2p5 training. The changes are not significant since the architecture and data preprocessing has not changed much structurally compared to previous version. The changes include:\r\n* unification of the interface for scaling (aka standardization) of inputs across subversions and reading of scaling constants from a separate namespace,\r\n* functionality to drop specific global variables from a general list (TauBlockInputs),\r\n* adaptation of runTauIdMVA.py tool,\r\n* new `deepTauId2018v2p5` producer added to the miniAOD workflow and its products (three raw tauIDs) stored in the `slimmedTaus` collection.\r\n\r\nFull list of adaptations needed for the v2p5 can be found here: [cms-tau-pog/TauMLTools/issues/99](https://github.com/cms-tau-pog/TauMLTools/issues/99).\r\n\r\nIn addition this PR consists of changes to DFIsolation producer (1st version of tauID based on DNN) which adapts the producer to changes in base class (previously overlooked).\r\n\r\n**Note:** this PR requires new training files being added to cms-data by https://github.com/cms-data/RecoTauTag-TrainingFiles/pull/8.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nStandard tests, i.e. `runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos`, passed successfully.\r\n\r\nBackward-compatibility checks: updated CMSSW code fully reproduces predictions of previous version (v2p1) of deepTauId.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nBackport of #37892.\r\n\r\nEnables new training of deepTauID which is meant to be dafulat for 2022 data taking.\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1652955335", "comments": 13, "commits": 32, "created_at": "1652796168", "deletions": 533, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "requires-external"], "merge_commit_sha": "7ff2ef61878d0cd01c89b6f5d580e4a02c06d765", "merged_at": "1652955335", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 37985, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Changes to enable new DeepTauId trainig [12_4_X]", "updated_at": "1652955336", "user": "mbluj"}

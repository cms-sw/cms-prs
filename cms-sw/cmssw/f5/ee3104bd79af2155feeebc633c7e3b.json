These are the ones that do not use a token. This code has been deprecated for a while and previously a lot of work has been done by many people to remove all the code that depended on the code deleted by this PR.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis is almost exclusively deletions. The fact that it successfully builds after running checkdeps eliminates almost all possibilities for errors. I also ran unit tests for FWCore/Framework and FWCore/Integration locally.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 0, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1672846266", "deletions": 87, "labels": ["core-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "number": 40427, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Remove deprecated EventSetup get functions", "updated_at": "1672846290", "user": "wddgit"}

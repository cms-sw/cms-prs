In https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/38941 BX assignment for muon showers in CSC unpacking/emulation changed, but the corresponding changes were not don in EMTF. \r\n\r\nThis PR also follows the same convention used in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/41993, so the emulated and unpacked showers should now be aligned as it should be.\r\n\r\nThis is a backport of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/42176\r\n\r\nI don't know which release will be used when LHC restarts, but this backport might be necessary for some re-emulation studies with 2023 data.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with a description of the feature proposed or problem addressed, specifying:\r\n  - what changes are expected in the output if any, \r\n  - what other PRs or externals it depends upon if any,\r\n  - link to any additional material useful to provide a documentation for this PR (slides, JIRA tickets, related pull requestes, hypernews, TWiki or Indico pages)  -->\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested with L1T menu experts to see unpacked/emulated shower matches.

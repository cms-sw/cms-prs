By doing this check, we can reduce spurious matches.\r\nIt will affect the number of GEMMuons, which are muons with at least one matched GEM rechit. With this change, the number of GEMMuons will decrease by removing irrelevant matches.  \r\nSlides detailing this change were presented to the GEM DPG group.\r\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/1577119/contributions/6645023/subcontributions/566782/attachments/3117123/5526888/GEMmergeexp_.pdf\r\nThe number of TrackerMuons aren't affected, and we don't expect any changes to physics muon properties.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nrunTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos\r\n`50 49 46 41 19 1 1 1 1 1 1 tests passed, 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 failed`\r\n1 fail also fails on the plain master branch.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

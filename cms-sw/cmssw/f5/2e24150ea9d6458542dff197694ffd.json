The symptom of the problem was a seg fault which occurred very rarely (#32065). The problem occurred very late in a cmsRun process as the EventProcessor was being destroyed and should not have had any other effect.\r\n\r\nThe most recently opened IOV for each EventSetup record type is held open. This change forces those IOVs to close earlier and within the recently added tbb arena::execute calls instead of executing the tasks that close them as the EventProcessor destructor runs.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRelies on existing unit tests.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 9, "closed_at": "1605222861", "comments": 18, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1605135453", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "0236ac0141fe4643e8e1a1607fc46ea78c547e30", "merged_at": "1605222861", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 32117, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Force the last IOVs to end earlier", "updated_at": "1605222861", "user": "wddgit"}

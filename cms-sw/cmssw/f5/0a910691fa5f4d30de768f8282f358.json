(Verified on one event that all rechits are the same down to 5 decimal places, but there can be smaller numerical differences clearly.)\n\nSpeedup of the EcalUncalibRecHitMultiFitAlgo is just short of a factor of 3.  (~800ms -> ~280ms for pu40bx25 photon gun)\n\nThe EcalUncalibRecHitProducer has also been made a stream module.\n\n@emanueledimarco @argiro @lgray \nAutomatically ported from CMSSW_7_2_X #5321\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_3_X", "changed_files": 12, "closed_at": "1411035092", "comments": 5, "commits": 8, "created_at": "1410974293", "deletions": 315, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "2e77ba71ceb357c8b01a5f92aba85037394114ea", "merged_at": "1411035092", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_3_X", "number": 5367, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Ecal multifit optimized", "updated_at": "1411035092", "user": "cmsbuild"}

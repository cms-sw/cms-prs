This trigger path was approved by TSG on March 13th (https://indico.cern.ch/event/1389073/).\r\n\r\nAs pointed out in the JIRA CMSHLT-3119, the validation strategy should be the same as the previous version of the path (using DeepJet), so it was copied over from the top DQM code with the necessary parameter changes. It's now important only to the Exotica PAG, so it was included in the Exotica DQM.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe DQM code was validated using a runTheMatrix workflow (modified to use the new trigger path). The resulting DQM file was uploaded to the DQM GUI at http://dqm-dev-test.cern.ch:8060/dqm/dev/ and it's a RelVal file. In particular, check that the new DQM plots are being created at the new HLT/EXO/DisplacedVertices/* folder and are populated with the passing events.\r\n\r\nA further local validation with fewer events was made to validate the backport to 14_0_X, which was straight-forward.", "branch": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1712319065", "comments": 9, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1711532346", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "backport-ok"], "merge_commit_sha": "85d653a5ce7c4aa4f34d5d117ca1342a473dcebe", "merged_at": "1712319065", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "number": 44553, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Backport of #44546: Add QuadJet with 3 b-tag PNet trigger to the DQM offline", "updated_at": "1712319101", "user": "brunolopesbr2"}

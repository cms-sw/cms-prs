This will be done at a second time, whence the core support for it will be cut out from the core-S/W group.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTSG Integration tests.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nVerbatim backport of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/47529 to CMSSW_15_0_X, meant for 2025 pp data-taking purposes.

This PR is a technical PR to migrate to using `EventSetup` with `ESGetToken` in `GEMCSCSegmentProducer`.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n`GEMCSCSegmentProducer` is not included in RECO. So, we can't verify this PR with any wf. So, I added `GEMCSCSegmentProducer` to step3 of 11850.0 for testing and confirmed it works well.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\nBackport of #36628. I'm planning a backport of #37178. Then, this fix should precede the backport of #37178 because #37178 uses `GEMCSCSegment`.", "branch": "CMSSW_12_2_X", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1648189684", "deletions": 22, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "upgrade-approved", "backport-ok"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_2_X", "number": 37341, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Migrate to EventSetup with ESGetToken in GEMCSCSegmentProducer (backport of #36628, 12_2_X)", "updated_at": "1648467202", "user": "seungjin-yang"}

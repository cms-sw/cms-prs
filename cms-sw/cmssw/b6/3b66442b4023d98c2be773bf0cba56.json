The changes are mainly to recover from #10373, and to remove the remaining CASTOR modules in reconstruction sequence (I guessed from the existing removals that this is the intention for now).\n\nI also intentionally \"broke\" the \"displaced muon reconstruction\" (#7531) for Phase1 by taking InOut iteration out of its merger (technically it still should work but the results bad). It should be enabled again after the Phase1 tracking sequences are migrated to the new classifiers+mergers of #10373 (but I want to see the 76X-Phase1 tracking validated against 62X_SLHC Phase1 tracking before that).\n\nTogether with #11609 (GT update) this PR gets the reco step of upgrade wf 10000.0 to technically work on a DIGI step2.root produced with the earlier default GT (75X_upgrade2017_design_v1), but when using the same GT consistently, the reco step still fails. This failure is addressed separately in #11624.\n\nTested in 760pre6, no changes expected in Run1/2 workflows.\n\n@rovere @VinInn @boudoul @venturia\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1444189900", "comments": 15, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1443778025", "deletions": 8, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "cbf2a686b31903c018e48bf6f3a350918fa05276", "merged_at": "1444189900", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 11621, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fixes for phase1 workflow", "updated_at": "1476956875", "user": "makortel"}

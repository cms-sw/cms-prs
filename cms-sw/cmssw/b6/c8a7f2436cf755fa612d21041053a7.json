The callers always\ncreated a temporary edm::Ref which was then discarded.\nThe TrackExtra::setHits API better enforces the requirements by taking\nan edm:RefProd to the container and then a starting index and number of\nentries into that container for the hits. Not only is setHits safer\nthan calling add it is also faster.\n\nTrackExtra::add had to go away anway because of work being done in\nthe framework which will no longer allow an edm::RefProd to be constructed\nfrom an edm::Ref.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 24, "closed_at": "1421640245", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1421442266", "deletions": 72, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fastsim-approved", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "4538a4c06647c858ae624e048477926acd46973b", "merged_at": "1421640245", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 7246, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Change all calls to TrackExtra::add to TrackExtra::setHits", "updated_at": "1422027097", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

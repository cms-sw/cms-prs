This doesn't hurt, since the HI event content is a superset of the pp one.  However, the implementation should be cleaned up.  \n\nA backport to 80X will also be made. \n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1468325540", "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1468324742", "deletions": 24, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "generators-pending", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 15172, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Point to 50ns vtx smearing for boosted pPb and clean up (81X)", "updated_at": "1468325540", "user": "mandrenguyen"}

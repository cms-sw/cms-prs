The training has been performed following what was done already done for Run 2, but using Run 3 MC samples for training and validation.\r\n\r\nContext of the PR\r\n\r\nThe goal for this new training is to be used as a substitute of the current mvaTTH only in Run 3 MC production. That is: for Run 2 we still need to keep the current mvaTTH implementation (can be found in these lines), and for Run 3 we want to make use of an era modifier to fetch the proper --new -- weights that have been computed.\r\n\r\nLinked PRs\r\n\r\nThis is the link for the PR that includes the weights in CMS-data: https://github.com/cms-data/PhysicsTools-NanoAOD/pull/16.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 7, "comments": 39, "commits": 9, "created_at": "1711033522", "deletions": 21, "labels": ["operations-pending", "reconstruction-approved", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "requires-external", "code-checks-approved", "xpog-approved", "muon", "egamma"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 44503, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "open", "title": "new Prompt Lepton ID MVA (and renaming)", "updated_at": "1711901137", "user": "vlimant"}

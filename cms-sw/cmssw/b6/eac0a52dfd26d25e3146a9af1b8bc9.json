This improves durability, in particular for cases where there are low statistics and poor fitting. This will change the resolution plots slightly, but will make it easier to spot problems or bugs. All other plots remain the same.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I cleaned up the code a tad, to make it more compact.\r\n\r\nThis is also a potential fix for Issue #31644 \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nChecked before and after comparisons of the resolution plots to make sure the change was reasonable and as expected, on a ttbar+200PU sample. \r\nRan runTheMatrix for wf 23234.0\r\nRan code checks (scram build code-checks; scram build code-format)\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\nNot a backport", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1614952986", "comments": 9, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1614886313", "deletions": 271, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "d427fe94dceae78623352761f6e6d061da2c533c", "merged_at": "1614952986", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 33073, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Switch resolution from Gaussian sigma to stdev for Phase2 L1T tracks", "updated_at": "1614952986", "user": "emacdonald16"}

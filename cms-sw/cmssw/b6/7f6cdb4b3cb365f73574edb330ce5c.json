Two new functionalities in the HGCDigitizer module \"loadSimHitAccumulator_forPreMix\" and \"saveSimHitAccumulator_forPreMix\" to handle timing for HGCal in a premix workflow.\r\n\r\n   2.  It also introduces a bunch of modifications to the existing class PHGCSimAccumulator for Premix workflow.\r\n\r\n    3. Necessary changes also have been made to the plugin modules SimCalorimetry/HGCalSimProducers/plugins/PreMixingHGCalWorker.cc and SimCalorimetry/HGCalSimProducers/plugins/HGCDigiProducer.h and SimGeneral/MixingModule/python/aliases_cfi.py\r\n\r\n  4.  It also introduces a few new datatypes in SimCalorimetry/HGCalSimProducers/interface/HGCDigitizerTypes.h\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nValidation was done using the standard validation step in the 20634.99 and 20634.0 workflow and also a custom timing validation package.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with any link to  -->\r\n\r\nBefore submitting your pull requests, make sure you followed this checklist:\r\n- verify that the PR is really intended for the chosen branch\r\n- verify that changes follow [CMS Naming, Coding, And Style Rules](http://cms-sw.github.io/cms_coding_rules.html)\r\n- verify that the PR passes the basic test procedure suggested in the [CMSSW PR instructions](https://cms-sw.github.io/PRWorkflow.html)\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 8, "closed_at": "1589207183", "comments": 25, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1589142628", "deletions": 124, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "b5d44d386db42cfdc105c973168ac9233fc32bb4", "merged_at": "1589207183", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 29793, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "New functions and Classes to enable HGCDigitizer to implement timing description for HGCal cells in a Premix Workflow.", "updated_at": "1589207184", "user": "adas1994"}

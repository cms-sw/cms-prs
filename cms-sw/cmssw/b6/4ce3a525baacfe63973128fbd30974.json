More description of DeepMET can be found in the orignal PR. (https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/30291). Most of the changes in `PhysicsTools/PatAlgos/plugins/RecoMETExtractor.cc` come from the code-format checks. Also backport https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/30926/ to fix the break condition.\r\n\r\nFor the ultra legacy (`run2_miniAOD_devel`) DeepMETs will not be computed on the fly, but to be extracted from MiniAOD. For other eras DeepMETs will be computed on the fly and saved to Nano.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCheck with different eras and work as expected. Also passed the `runTheMatrix.py` without errors.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nBackport of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/30291 and https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/30926/\r\n\r\n@steggema @intrepid42 \r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1598414755", "comments": 27, "commits": 9, "created_at": "1597156886", "deletions": 32, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "backport-ok", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved", "xpog-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "65d478b74892d935d6492f53dc486b82fa2352a9", "merged_at": "1598414755", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 31120, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add DeepMET into NanoAOD for UltraLegacy in 10_6_X (backport of 30291 and 30926)", "updated_at": "1598414755", "user": "yongbinfeng"}

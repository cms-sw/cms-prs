It is necessary to ensure that all steps (DIGI, L1T, DIGI2RAW, and RAW2DIGI) are run correctly, for all the eras (Run2, Run3, Phase-2). The changes are minimal, so that the names of all producers and analyzers involved remain the same. The GEM TP producers are now in new package `L1Trigger/L1TGEM`.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI checked that it runs with WF 11634.0 in CMSSW_11_0_X_2019-10-22-1100.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n@tahuang1991 ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 17, "closed_at": "1572462490", "comments": 23, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1571913184", "deletions": 65, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "5e329bbb289c793cf4da7109596022649e58096c", "merged_at": "1572462490", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 28254, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Move GEM trigger primitive producers from DIGI to L1 step", "updated_at": "1572462491", "user": "dildick"}

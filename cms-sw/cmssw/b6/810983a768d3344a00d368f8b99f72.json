Previously, the rec hits were always put into the event, even when the digi handles were invalid. The updated logic includes checks to prevent this behavior, avoiding unnecessary allocations and potential issues during event processing.\r\nKey Changes:\r\n\r\n- Added conditions to ensure `HGCalUncalibRecHits` are only added to the event if the corresponding digi collection exists.\r\n- Removed redundant `evt.put()` calls for invalid digi \r\n- Improved the clarity and structure of the `HGCalUncalibRecHitProducer::produce` function by handling each digi collection independently.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1726144589", "deletions": 13, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "bug-fix", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-pending", "hgcal"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_2_X", "number": 45992, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Fix: Avoid adding HGCalUncalibRecHits to the event if digis do not exist", "updated_at": "1726144715", "user": "felicepantaleo"}

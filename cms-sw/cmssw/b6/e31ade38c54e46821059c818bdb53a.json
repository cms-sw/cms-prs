Now most part of alternative Physics Lists use only components from geant4 libraries instead of CMS custom. \r\n\r\nLocal EM physics builder are updated according to recent modifications in Geant4. \r\n\r\nHeader files of CMS Physics Lists are renamed according to the CMS code conversion (.h instead of .hh).\r\n\r\nModifications better correspond to the coming new Geant4 10.4 but are working with the current Geant4 10.2.\r\n\r\nThe default Physics List FTFP_BERT_EMM is not changed, so unchanged results are expected.

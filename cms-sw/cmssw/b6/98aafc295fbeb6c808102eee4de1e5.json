The entry point to the GPU code is `RawToDigi_wrapper` in SiPixelRawToDigi.cc\r\n\r\n- The device functions `RawToDigi_kernel` performs RawToDigi conversion on GPU\r\n\r\n- After RawToDigi conversion `applyADCthreshold_kernel` is invoked (optional through bool convertADCtoElectrons) which performs calibrations ADC to Electrons and applies channel thresholding. The ADC to Electrons calibration and thresholding is required by Clustering algorithm.", "branch": "CMSSW_9_4_X", "changed_files": 31, "closed_at": "1512128836", "comments": 13, "commits": 18, "created_at": "1510752836", "deletions": 15384, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "core-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-rejected", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_9_4_X", "number": 21321, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "GPU RawToDigi C940", "updated_at": "1512128836", "user": "sushildubey171"}

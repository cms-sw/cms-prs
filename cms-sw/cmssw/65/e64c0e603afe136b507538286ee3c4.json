This filter, in particular, enables tau filtering based on particle-net.\r\nThe PR introduces the following changes:\r\n* Adds `TauTagFilter`: an event filter based on the number of tau candidates that pass a selection which combines kinematic requirements (pt, eta) and requirements on jet-tagging. Optionally it also requires a matching with seeds and applies a pt correction;\r\n* Moves `TauWPThreshold` utility class from `DeepTauId` code to a separate file to be used by both `DeepTauId` and `TauTagFilter` (and possibly others in future);\r\n* Fixes `L2TauTagFilter.cc` to set correct id to output object.\r\n\r\nNo changes are expected in existing workflows (except correct id of objects returned by `L2TauTagFilter`).\r\n\r\nDetailed performance of new HLT paths using newly introduced TauTagFilter and based on particle-net taggers presented at the TSG meeting on 2023-10-25: [link to indico](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1336796/#44-status-update-on-pnet-tau-t).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode tested using CMSSW_13_3_0_pre3 with a custom HLT python configuration (with MC): [hltMC_PNet_tau.py](https://github.com/cms-tau-pog/cmssw/files/12928035/hltMC_PNet_tau.py.txt)\r\n\r\nThe matrix tests `runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos` successful.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 12, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1698150036", "deletions": 52, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "hlt-approved", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_3_X", "number": 43100, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 4, "state": "open", "title": "Enable HLT tau filtering based on jet-tags (ParticleNet)", "updated_at": "1698297604", "user": "mbluj"}

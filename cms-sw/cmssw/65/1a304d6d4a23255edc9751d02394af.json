The MET Phi corrections are intended to mitigate the observed azimuthal angle modulation of missing transverse momentum (MET). The corrections were derived by @lathomas and can be found at the following link: https://lathomas.web.cern.ch/lathomas/METStuff/XYCorrections/\r\nThis PR is just the CMSSW implementation of those corrections using an already existing module with some adaptions.\r\nThe effect of the PR can be seen in more details in the following two presentations, which were given in the MET meeting:\r\n1. https://indico.cern.ch/event/1153621/contributions/4849172/attachments/2431720/4164278/presentation.pdf\r\n2. https://indico.cern.ch/event/1166184/contributions/4897784/attachments/2453553/4204792/presentation.pdf\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nSuccesfully performed code-checks and code-format.\r\nBesides some file read/open errors, the runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all command also seemed to work succesfully.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 8, "comments": 0, "commits": 10, "created_at": "1655877402", "deletions": 44, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 38461, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Add possibility to apply latest MET Phi corrections during MiniAOD processing", "updated_at": "1655877447", "user": "michaelwassmer"}

In particular, it is for HI tracking done under the Run2_2017_trackingPhase1QuadProp era. The following changes are made:\r\n\r\n1) Fixed a missing product in the regional muon tracking which was causing a crash.\r\n2) Changed tracking iterations to use all 4 layers of the pixels instead of the first 3\r\n3) Added tracking iterations: LowPtQuadStep, DetachedQuadStep, and highPtTripletStep\r\n4) Changed seeding from triplets to Cellular Automaton quadruplets\r\n\r\nMost of these changes are attached to the 'trackingPhase1QuadProp.' modifier. I am not sure if this is more appropriate to use than the 'trackingPhase1' modifer; perhaps someone can comment.\r\n\r\nIn order to Test this PR, one needs do the following:\r\n\r\n1) Merge the PR and do a 'scram build.'\r\n2) Comment out lines 38-50 in RecoHI/Configuration/python/Reconstruction_HI_cff.py in order to prevent issues related to workflows downstream of the tracking (some of these do not work in Run2_2017 era, but are out of the scope of this PR).\r\n3) Copy and run the config file found here: /afs/cern.ch/user/a/abaty/work/public/forPeople/forPhase1PR_May5/\r\n, which runs the Run2_2017 track reconstruction on a sample of MB Hydjet events privately produced with SIM of the new pixel detector.\r\n@mandrenguyen", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 18, "closed_at": "1496169636", "comments": 59, "commits": 10, "created_at": "1494348844", "deletions": 15, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "53588f2bc06a410acb9b430c1a7c264ca5b497a0", "merged_at": "1496169636", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_2_X", "number": 18646, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "First Round of Phase 1 Tracking changes for Heavy Ions", "updated_at": "1496169636", "user": "abaty"}

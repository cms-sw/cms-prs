This PR implements that, using the existing `HcalPhase` parameter (held over from 62XSLHC, so far unused in modern releases).\r\n\r\nI also added a case for tower 17, which now has 2 depths and can be treated similarly to the other towers.\r\n\r\nThese diagrams show phase 0, phase 1, and \"HEP17\" = phase 1 combined to be as close to phase 0 as possible (though NB above caveat about tower 17 in this PR):\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://kjplanet.com/pr/HCAL-Depth-Segmentation-Legacy-View-HE-v201706A.png\" alt=\"phase 0 depths\" width=198 height=209> <img src=\"http://kjplanet.com/pr/HCAL-Depth-Segmentation-Phase1-HBHE-View-HE-v201706A.png\" alt=\"phase 1 depths\" width=198 height=209> <img src=\"http://kjplanet.com/pr/HCAL-Depth-Segmentation-Phase1-HBHE-View-HE-Label-HEP17-v201706A.png\" alt=\"phase 1 depths\" width=200 height=209>\r\n\r\nattn: @abdoulline @igv4321 @bsunanda @Sam-Harper \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1513662435", "comments": 19, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1513178269", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "aa39f49937b66fc61ea1b77c7cf5f255ed31ce20", "merged_at": "1513662435", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_0_X", "number": 21703, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix CaloTower outer energy for HE 2018", "updated_at": "1513662435", "user": "kpedro88"}

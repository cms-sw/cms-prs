The position of the Silicon wafers has been move down to 250um w.r.t. the bottom foil and the envelopes with sensors ad flexible cables has been enlarged to avoid volume overlaps. Besides, the U shape of the Aluminum supports has been changed to a plain squared piece. A detailed list of the file changes and visualization of the new changes in the Pixel sensors is given in this [twiki](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/PPSPixelGeometryFix1210pre2).\r\n\r\nIncludes updated on both DDD and dd4hep files as well as a new entry in dict2021Geometry.py named P7 with the latest geometry XML files.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe new changes in the geometry have been validated with the full CMS geometry dump for visualization and overlap check with tolerance 0.01, plus direct and full simulation to confirm hits in both pixel and timing detectors.\r\n\r\nAll changes follow the Naming Rules for new XML files in geometry.\r\nAll workflow tests done.\r\n\r\nNo backport needed.\r\n\r\nFYI @fabferro ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 19, "comments": 2, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1632159812", "deletions": 25, "labels": ["geometry-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "number": 35346, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Fixes for PPS geometry on Pixel sensors and materials", "updated_at": "1632160165", "user": "diemort"}

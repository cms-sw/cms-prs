This PR is just the first attemp to make thing works. It will need more to review the result.\r\n- The main issue comes from the interplay between `run3_common` and `fastSim` modifiers.\r\n- It is not clear we should exclude GEM also as we did for Run-2. I just create FastSim era in the same way as Run_2 by excluding it. It may not need to exclude anymore.\r\n- Maybe in the PR to merge, we should add a workflow of Run-3 FastSim.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nThe following cmsDriver run until end:\r\n`cmsDriver.py TTbar_14TeV_TuneCP5_cfi -s GEN,SIM,RECOBEFMIX,DIGI:pdigi_valid,L1,DIGI2RAW,L1Reco,RECO -n 10 --conditions auto:phase1_2021_realistic --beamspot Run3RoundOptics25ns13TeVLowSigmaZ --datatier GEN-SIM-DIGI-RECO --eventcontent FEVTDEBUGHLT --fast  --geometry DB:Extended --era Run3_FastSim --no_exec`\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\nNot a backport and no need of backport", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 4, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1648220940", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["simulation-pending", "operations-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 37347, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[Draft/Not to merge] To make FastSim work for Run-3", "updated_at": "1648221665", "user": "srimanob"}

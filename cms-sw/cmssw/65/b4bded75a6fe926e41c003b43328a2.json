This PR is to handle Run-3 FastSim workflow.\r\n- The main issue comes from the interplay between `run3_common` and `fastSim` modifiers. This is fix.\r\n\r\nStill to look at (maybe at the later PR):\r\n- It is not clear we should exclude GEM also as we did for Run-2. I just create FastSim era in the same way as Run_2 by excluding it. It may not need to exclude anymore.\r\n- Workflows are added in the same style as 2018. Should we move to upgrade workflow?\r\n\r\nIssue:\r\n- Currently, Workflows run upto PAT. However, the validation, dqm and harvesting are not yet done for miniaod. \r\n- Nano does not work yet.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nConfigs from following runTheMatrix run until the end.\r\n`runTheMatrix.py --what standard -l 2021.1,2021.8 -t 8 --wm init`\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\nNot a backport and no need of backport", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "comments": 9, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1648220940", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["simulation-pending", "operations-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 37347, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Run-3 FastSim", "updated_at": "1648231744", "user": "srimanob"}

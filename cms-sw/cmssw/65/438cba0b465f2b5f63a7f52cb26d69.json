Version 6 did not get added to the version size    mapping, but was allowed in modules, leading to reading out of boundaries.\r\n    This by luck did not cause any problems so far on standard gcc builds on x86_64, but caused assertion in IB tests in for CLANG build, as well as ARM and PPC builds where it was spotted (see https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/32091)\r\n\r\nFix also removes hardcoded version from around the code. It is now defined only in the same header file where it also defines std::array size.\r\n\r\nBugfix doesn't change any other behavior.\r\nNote: it does NOT affect anything used in production DAQ, only version 5 FRD is used there and that is not affected.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nFixes unit test in EventFilter/Utilities/test for CLANG build.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1605254880", "comments": 38, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1605128329", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "core-approved", "daq-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "0bef875ecc0236a08c4118bbfff4c62075e76962", "merged_at": "1605254880", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 32116, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "DAQ: fix FedRawData source going out of array boundaries", "updated_at": "1605254881", "user": "smorovic"}

I profit of the PR to drop the cms type specification as generally required.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRun successfully `runTheMatrix.py -l 142.0,24834.0 -t 4 -j 8 --ibeos` and checked that the empty plots are now filled.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

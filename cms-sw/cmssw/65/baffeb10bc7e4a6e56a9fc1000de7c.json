Already presented in ECAL DPG, JetMET POG and E/gamma groups:\r\n1. ECAL DPG: https://indico.cern.ch/event/991261/contributions/4283096/attachments/2219229/3757719/beamHalo_31march_v1.pdf\r\n 2. JetMET POG: https://indico.cern.ch/event/1027614/contributions/4314949/attachments/2224472/3767396/beamHalo_12April.pdf\r\n 3. E/gamma: https://indico.cern.ch/event/1095380/#13-beam-halo-tagging-in-ee\r\nThe last presentation has the checks done as well comparing the implementation using private framework \r\nand the CMSSW implementation. \r\nThis implementation touches the DataFromats/EgammaCandidates/Photon.h \r\nThe PR for training file will be done as well in RecoEgamma/PhotonIdentification/data\r\n\r\nThis training is relevant for photons with PT > 100 GeV - the regime important for single photon (+MET) analyses. \r\nThe runMatrix tests have been done and they all ran successfully.\r\n\r\nCurrently the changes are done only at the miniAOD level. After the discussion with the xpog, the relevant variable will be put in the nanoAOD as well. \r\n\r\nThanks to @thomreis for the help. \r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 12, "comments": 6, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1644190689", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "requires-external", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 36901, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Implementation of beam halo tagger algorithm for the endcap photons", "updated_at": "1644248935", "user": "jainshilpi"}

As agreed with @VinInn we should find a better way to avoid capturing VLAs in lambdas (eventually getting rid of the VLA itself, since it did not make C++14).\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_2_X", "changed_files": 19, "closed_at": "1413806062", "comments": 17, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1411371338", "deletions": 21, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "dqm-pending", "l1-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-rejected"], "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_2_X", "number": 5465, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Backport clang fixes", "updated_at": "1413806062", "user": "ktf"}

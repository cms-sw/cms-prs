The modification is to enable triggering on the negative timing region that can target beam halo and satellite collisions, and allow for maximum timing to be specified in the positive timing side to enable some delayed jet triggers to be added to parking dataset. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI ran over HLTPhysics using Run2022G dataset and saw no change in the rates. \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 235, "comments": 25, "commits": 148, "created_at": "1679064971", "deletions": 157514, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "dqm-pending", "l1-pending", "hlt-pending", "core-pending", "analysis-pending", "alca-pending", "db-pending", "generators-pending", "geometry-pending", "operations-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-approved", "xpog-pending", "heterogeneous-pending", "tracking", "trk"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_1_X", "number": 41089, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "open", "title": "Add upper cut on jet time to HLTJetTimingFilter", "updated_at": "1679665750", "user": "ssantpur"}

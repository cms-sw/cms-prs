This is needed for the ttbar spin entanglement analysis, which uses preLegacy 2016 data. For this analysis, a sample with the Powheg process \"ttb_NLO_dec\" is needed for a cross-check. This process has the same final state as BB4L (up to three real emissions) and thus uses the same hook.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nSee #42264.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nBackport of #42264, as written above.\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1698939438", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["generators-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-rejected", "orp-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "number": 43173, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[Backport 7_1_X] Fix EmissionVetoHook for BB4L", "updated_at": "1699026076", "user": "lauridsj"}

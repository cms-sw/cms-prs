Previously the CaloLayer1 payload data contain only the first FB (FB0) from HCAL, now there is a new fw version that extends the payload data format to contain all other FB (FB1-5), so the unpacker is modified to unpack them. For flexibility there is a flag in the payload header to tell if the additional HCAL FB is implemented or not, therefore two new unpackers (one with UCTCTP7RawData_HCALFB.h for normal event unpacker, another with UCTCTP7RawData5BX_HCALFB.h for fat event unpacker) are added to be used when this flag is set, otherwise the usual unpackers (not for additional HCAL FB implementation) are used and no modification is made to them in this PR. DQM is also modified for these HCAL FB monitoring.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nOffline DQM was run on past commissioning runs, expected DQM elements are added.\r\n\r\nThis PR is closed immediately after opened, and to be sent to DQM team for short production test during coming CRUZET runs, where the new relevant CaloLayer1 fw version will be tested together.\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "changed_files": 7, "comments": 6, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1678320530", "deletions": 81, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "l1-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "backport", "hcal"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "number": 41002, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Layer1 unpacker and DQM modified for HCALFB [13_0_X]", "updated_at": "1678688475", "user": "hftsoi"}

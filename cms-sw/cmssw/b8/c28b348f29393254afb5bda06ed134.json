If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nNot a backport, though backports should probably be made to any releases with which run 3 MC and data are going to be processed.\r\n\r\n@yongbinfeng @mseidel42 \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1715863726", "deletions": 11, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 44986, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Add protection against nan inputs for DeepMET", "updated_at": "1715864031", "user": "steggema"}

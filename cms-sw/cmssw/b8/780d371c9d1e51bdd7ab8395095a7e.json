Two versions of the emulator are supplied, one based closely on the HLS code itself, and another that aims to provide identical results with a more cmssw-friendly implementation.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nEmulator outputs were checked against each other as well as the existing PuppiMet implementation without truncation, with close agreement found between all results.\r\n\r\nRebasing from https://github.com/cms-l1t-offline/cmssw/pull/895\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nRebasing from https://github.com/cms-l1t-offline/cmssw/pull/895", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1620903411", "comments": 23, "commits": 14, "created_at": "1620110624", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "ddf0711707f1aed509907e9dbf2c2e85516e45bf", "merged_at": "1620903411", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "number": 33619, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 12, "state": "closed", "title": "L1T Phase-2: Quantized Puppi MET emulators ", "updated_at": "1620903411", "user": "cecilecaillol"}

This is to prevent rare instances, where FastJet would cluster negative pT particles over large distances, and a large, negative particle become a jet in the opposite direction.\n\nAlso, the printf() have been converted to EDM log messages.\n\nNo performance difference is expected, except for jets either at |eta| ~ 5, or rare events that previously would have contained unreasonably large jet pTs (e.g. 10 TeV).\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1453606241", "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1447775623", "deletions": 19, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 12463, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Apply a \"boundary condition\" at the outermost pseudorapidity edges", "updated_at": "1453606241", "user": "yslai"}

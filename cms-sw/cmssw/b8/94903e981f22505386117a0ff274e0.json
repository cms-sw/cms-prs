I think there were changes in SimDataFormats/SLHC as well, for the L1CaloTower.h et al files\n- also contains the (new) code that builds simple L1EG objects based on crystal-level information, from Nick Smith and Sasha Savin (in SLHCUpgradeSimulations/L1CaloTrigger/plugins, L1ExtraCrystalPosition.cc and L1EGammaCrystalsProducer.cc. New class L1EGCrystalCluster.h in SimDataFormats/SLHC)\n", "branch": "CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "changed_files": 161, "closed_at": "1413930742", "comments": 5, "commits": 108, "created_at": "1412685769", "deletions": 2061, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "geometry-pending", "l1-pending", "new-package-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "5fcb05b1c8fd545c9bff830e62cbe8ce57d7f14a", "merged_at": "1413930742", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "number": 5722, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "TTI 62 x Version of the code used for the TP version circulated in August", "updated_at": "1413930742", "user": "EmanuelPerez"}

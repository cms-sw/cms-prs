The changes include:\r\n\r\n1. Reduced verbosity of some modules ( b467869 5b714bb  ) \r\nThis makes the stderr files procuded by plugins/ApeEstimator.cc shorter and consume disk less space (was: 9mb per file per iteration per measurement). Now, these files can be searched for fatal errors that would not be caught otherwise, which helps tracing back job failures. test/cfgTemplate/apeLocalSetting_cfg.py produced a lot of unneccessary output which flooded the terminal.\r\n\r\n2. Improved skimming tool ( fae3000 ccd3aca  ) \r\nFixed a few errors. Also made starting a large number of skims easier.\r\n\r\n3. More natural configuration of the automated submission tool, improved error detection ( 0357460 )\r\nThe way that a config file is built was changed. The input file name definition is now more dynamic and easier. Finished or failed measurements are now logged. One can now specify the name of the file in which the current measurements are stored in case on wants to run multiple instances of autoSubmitter and cancel/resume any of them.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1536052876", "comments": 11, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1535982665", "deletions": 73, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "dbbbce795f99fb0d0ff64997721629d91b0b58cb", "merged_at": "1536052876", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_3_X", "number": 24448, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Improvements to APE tool: Usability and error fixes", "updated_at": "1536052876", "user": "mteroerd"}

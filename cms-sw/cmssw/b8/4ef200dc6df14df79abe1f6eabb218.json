Additions are italicized below.\r\n\r\nA few updates:\r\n\r\n- Fix crash in RecHitTask exposed by beam splashes. For the plan-1 collapsed RecHits that do not exist in the actual detector, the HcalElectronicsId must not be used. One such case was hidden by an energy cut, so wasn't noticed earlier.\r\n- Take adc2fC conversion from conditions instead of a hard-coded table.\r\n- Integrated a fix for the number of samples in trigger primitive emulation, needed for TPTask to work.\r\n- Add HF dual anode asymmetry plots. _Enabled by an Eras modifier, to ensure the code doesn't try to access nonexistent HFPreRecHits._\r\n- _Add some timing plots for HEP17 phase scan._\r\n- Smaller fixes: adjustments to axis ranges, ADC vs TDC plot, fix uMNIO crate# in fed2crate map, add HEP17 to local run tasks (LEDTask, PedestalTask, LaserTask), protect QIE11Task against laser and/or CRF digis ending up in QIE11DigiCollection (want only HEP17).\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 39, "closed_at": "1499101590", "comments": 65, "commits": 68, "created_at": "1495148833", "deletions": 719, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "b0da358b0279d500370583b6e9036770a55c19ad", "merged_at": "1499101590", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_3_X", "number": 18841, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 16, "state": "closed", "title": "HCALDQM: fix RecHitTask crash, adc2fC from DB, fix TPTask, add plots ", "updated_at": "1499343878", "user": "DryRun"}

Clusters are zero-padded (see [these slides](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/1m47c74c19gt1vks9etc5/2025-01-17-Updated-Documentation-Barrel-GCT-Clusters-to-Correlator-Layer-1.pdf?rlkey=rottdsivjj8t0fl08l338r6bk&dl=0) for schematics). \r\n- The digitized clusters also contain `edm::Ref` to their parent clusters.\r\n\r\nNote that this will affect the ParticleFlow code since the inputs are renamed; this has been agreed upon to be changed in a separate PR since the changes to the ParticleFlow code will need to be validated separately. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n- An [analyzer](https://github.com/skkwan/phase2-l1Calo-analyzer/blob/devel-GCTBarrelToCorrelator/plugins/L1CaloEGammaSingleAnalyzer.cc) was used to check that the containerized digitized clusters can be read out and give the exact same real eta/phi location as the previous outputs. The edm::Ref to the parent clusters (for non-null clusters) has also been checked\r\n- scram b code-format, scram build code-checks \r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

Before my cleaning PR, this library was linked against by some other plugin, and that's how the plugin got registered in the past [2].\r\n\r\nNow, the plugin can be found again with `edmPluginHelp -p L1GtTriggerMaskTechTrigTrivialProducer` and the previously-failing unit test succeeds.\r\n\r\n[1] <https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/RecoEgamma/EgammaPhotonProducers/BuildFile.xml>\r\n[2] <https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/31548/files#diff-d35b5dbd3e30c40bee4cc0c5bd6ae022L13>\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n* the `L1GtTriggerMaskTechTrigTrivialProducer` can be found once again with `edmPluginHelp`\r\n* unit test `./src/DQM/Integration/test/runtest.sh scal_dqm_sourceclient-live_cfg.py` passes again\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nNo backport intended.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1601333143", "comments": 13, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1601139835", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "27f770598e69d37f79b84f23f49ac373395ffc25", "merged_at": "1601333143", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 31593, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix unit test failure in DQM/Integration (issue 31592)", "updated_at": "1601333143", "user": "guitargeek"}

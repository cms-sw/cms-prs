It is not always useful to run a filter prior to the vertex producer I believe, and hence I make this optional.\r\n\r\nThis pull request is intended to remove the dependency of running a filter prior to the HLTDisplacedmumuVtxProducer\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI checked compilation in 11_2_0_pre8, and functionality in CMSSW_11_1_0 where the same results for displaced vertices are present and muons are present before and after the change in the scouting event content.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with any link to  -->\r\n\r\nBefore submitting your pull requests, make sure you followed this checklist:\r\n- verify that the PR is really intended for the chosen branch\r\n- verify that changes follow [CMS Naming, Coding, And Style Rules](http://cms-sw.github.io/cms_coding_rules.html)\r\n- verify that the PR passes the basic test procedure suggested in the [CMSSW PR instructions](https://cms-sw.github.io/PRWorkflow.html)\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1604910798", "comments": 11, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1604659151", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "hlt-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "92154ca74515006a5bdafebb028111ba5c397853", "merged_at": "1604910798", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 32044, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Update disp mu mu producer", "updated_at": "1604910798", "user": "jsalfeld"}

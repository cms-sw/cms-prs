This is a bug.  In CMSSW at the moment, it is always called with the same value, but it still is a bug.\n\nThis pull request makes the data member non-static.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1384119608", "comments": 4, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1383853105", "deletions": 10, "labels": ["fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "fb51978656d4a143b89bfcb9a051838e22775dce", "merged_at": "1384119608", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_0_0_pre9", "number": 1374, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "static data member is not thread safe and doesn't need to be static", "updated_at": "1406904797", "user": "wmtan"}

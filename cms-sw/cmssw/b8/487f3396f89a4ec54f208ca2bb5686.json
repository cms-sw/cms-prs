Changes were made in certain files under `DQMOffline/Trigger`:\r\n`plugins/TopMonitor.cc`\r\n`python/TopMonitor_cfi.py`\r\n`python/TopMonitoring_Client_cff.py`\r\n`python/TopMonitoring_cff.py`\r\n\r\n**Changes :** \r\n- A flag to enable and disable the creation of 2D DQM plots was added (enable2DPlots) and was set to True by default. \r\n  - This flag was set to False in the  TOP HLT DQM module configuration : \r\n    - 2-d histograms under sub-folders HLT/TOP/* will not be produced. \r\n- Added monitoring of the following HLT paths : \r\n  1. HLT_PFHT400_SixPFJet32_DoublePFBTagDeepJet_2p94_v\r\n  2. HLT_PFHT450_SixPFJet36_PFBTagDeepJet_1p59_v\r\nAs a result, two additional sub-folders are expected to be produced: \r\nHLT/TOP/FullyHadronic/DoubleBTagDeepJet\r\nHLT/TOP/FullyHadronic/SingleBTagDeepJet  \r\nNote : The deepCSV tagger is used for the selection of offline b-tagged jets since the deepjet b-tag handle is not available at RECO level. The compatibility of the trigger efficiency derived when selecting offline b-tagged jets with the deepjet vs the deepcsv tagger can be seen in slide 6 of [this](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1191718/#22-top-pag) presentation. In the future we could consider calculating the deep-jet outputs of the offline jets on-the-fly. \r\n\r\nNo changes are expected in any of the previously produced histograms in folders other than HLT/TOP\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nTested with runTheMatrix.py -l 11634.0\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

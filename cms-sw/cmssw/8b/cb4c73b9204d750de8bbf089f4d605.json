For more details, please refer to [this Proton POG presentation](https://indico.cern.ch/event/952808/contributions/4003276/attachments/2098963/3528490/kaspar_systematics.pdf)\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe direct simulation is not included in any central workflows (neither in matrix tests). Therefore no changes are expected there.\r\n\r\nSome validation plots are available in the above-linked POG presentation.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 11, "closed_at": "1600173046", "comments": 12, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1600064473", "deletions": 18, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "d14915809eee39737751ba13f16274f84f288ed5", "merged_at": "1600173046", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 31453, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "PPS: direct simulation with xangle distributions", "updated_at": "1600173046", "user": "jan-kaspar"}

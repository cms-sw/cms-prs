And every time we calculate it on the fly in the ntuplization step using the generalTrack collection, which also means that we have to use a data-tier that has generalTrack collection saved in it. Adding this variable directly to dataformat will make things easier. \r\n\r\nThe exact definition of track isolation closely follows the definition currently used in EGamma tag-and-probe setup (see [here](https://github.com/swagata87/EgammaAnalysis-TnPTreeProducer/blob/Run3_13XY/plugins/SCVariableHelper.h) and [here](https://github.com/swagata87/EgammaAnalysis-TnPTreeProducer/blob/Run3_13XY/python/egmGoodParticlesDef_cff.py#L185-L196) ). Parameters like cone-size etc are not hard-coded and can be changed from config file if needed.  \r\n\r\nRunning on a few DY MC events, I checked that both approaches produce similar results. \r\n```\r\nFrom EGM T&P tool  | From CMSSW after this PR\r\nSC trk Iso 1.9281  | 1.9280990362167358\r\nSC trk Iso 10.9376 | 10.937553405761719\r\nSC trk Iso 3.22729 | 3.227292060852051\r\n\r\nSC trk Iso 1.1073   | 1.107303261756897\r\nSC trk Iso 0.545862 | 0.5458621978759766 \r\nSC trk Iso 2.90094  | 2.9009439945220947\r\n```\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nChecked with workflows `23634.0` and `12434.0` that they ran fine.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 10, "comments": 9, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1684741286", "deletions": 31, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "egamma"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_2_X", "number": 41745, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "open", "title": "Adding track isolation of mustache superclusters in dataformats", "updated_at": "1685362849", "user": "swagata87"}

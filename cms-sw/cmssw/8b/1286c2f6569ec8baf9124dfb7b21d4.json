The behaviour when the `muIdx` field is not explicitly set should be identical to the current one.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRunning the usual standard tests locally. (WIP until they succeed.)\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "comments": 6, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1653213964", "deletions": 7, "labels": ["l1-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 38035, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Compute muon index bits using idx from dataformat", "updated_at": "1653728716", "user": "dinyar"}

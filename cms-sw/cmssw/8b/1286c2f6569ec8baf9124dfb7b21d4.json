The behaviour when the `muIdx` field is not explicitly set should be identical to the current one.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRunning the usual standard tests locally. (WIP until they succeed.)\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1653897962", "comments": 12, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1653213964", "deletions": 7, "labels": ["l1-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "5c1068d43fcf3304d6b7e88d46cb08743e03ab02", "merged_at": "1653897962", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 38035, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Compute muon index bits using idx from dataformat", "updated_at": "1653897962", "user": "dinyar"}

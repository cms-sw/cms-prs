Here is the original message:\r\n\r\nThe JME python configurations had many vestiges left of previous migrations, as well as considerable \"top-level\" customization that is no longer relevant. I have consolidated the RecoPFJets_cff customizations into separate cfi python files in RecoJets/JetProducers.\r\n\r\nRemoved iterative cone, SIScone, and AK5 PF and Calo jets in all configurations.\r\nConsolidated the various grooming schemes into a single file per jet radius (so, AK4 puppi is now in ak4PFJets_cfi, for instance).\r\nLeft AK4, AK8, KT4, KT6, and only AK5/7 Castor collections since those are the only ones used anywhere in the repository.\r\nAdded an example AK8 GenJet configuration with grooming applied, since this is a common question. It is not presently run anywhere, though.\r\nEDIT: No changes should occur to any output, this is a reorganization.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 72, "closed_at": "1498800495", "comments": 46, "commits": 15, "created_at": "1498137708", "deletions": 1186, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "97467bb9b4552da8afe894507ed4ca9404681e12", "merged_at": "1498800495", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_3_X", "number": 19406, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "Rebase of #19222: JME python configuration cleanup for 92x", "updated_at": "1498800495", "user": "rappoccio"}

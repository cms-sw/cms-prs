I checked the `cmsDriver` commands before and after the change using `runTheMatrix.py --dryRun` to make sure nothing was unintentionally altered.\r\n\r\nIn the process, I fixed a bug that the 2018 tracking workflows were actually using 2017 steps. I also changed the offset numbers for the Phase 2 timing and neutron workflows to be separate from the tracking workflows.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "comments": 4, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1516732991", "deletions": 72, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "upgrade-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_0_X", "number": 21932, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "standardize implementation and offsets for special tracking workflows", "updated_at": "1516733123", "user": "kpedro88"}

Now, in this case the submission is retried after some waiting time until it works.\r\n  * Support for running multiple threads to handle measurements in case of large campaigns. Before, it happened that condor jobs (that do the track refits) of  measurements finished while another measurement was being handled, so that there was some delay before these measurements were handled, which piled up to longer delay when doing many measurements. \r\n   * Some minor changes like putting some functions into helper.py and introducing new shortcuts for convenience.\r\n\r\n#### PR Validation:\r\n\r\nThe validation happened while using the tool. Since no changes were made that could affect the APE results themselves, everything was transparent.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 13, "closed_at": "1565608449", "comments": 22, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1564578164", "deletions": 310, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "be19ba986e786b37bb8f7c5954274f2220c597ec", "merged_at": "1565608448", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27656, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "APE tool: Trend plots, some minor fixes", "updated_at": "1565608449", "user": "mteroerd"}

Most of these refer to Phase 2 detector configurations that no longer exist, so it is not worth the effort to propagate the renaming. A few exceptions are made here for configs that may be used in unit tests.\r\n\r\nA mistake from #27449 in the D44 workflow (wrong version of the forward region) is also fixed.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nMatrix workflow 20034.0 runs successfully.\r\n\r\nUnit tests also run successfully.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 103, "closed_at": "1563388762", "comments": 63, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1562809211", "deletions": 627, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "db-approved", "geometry-approved", "l1-pending", "operations-approved", "orp-approved", "pdmv-approved", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved", "visualization-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "10f7c5bc09e0286c01032ae83af3db0fd6b82894", "merged_at": "1563388761", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27488, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 18, "state": "closed", "title": "rename 2023 -> 2026, fix bug in D44", "updated_at": "1563388762", "user": "kpedro88"}

This is an alternative to https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/37496 where charges from duplicate pixels are summed up.\r\n\r\nNo changes are expected in MC samples because duplicate pixels are not expected to appear in simulation. Nevertheless, as discussed below in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/37559#issuecomment-1099529597 and follow-up comments, it was observed that duplicate pixels actually do appear in Phase 2 MC workflows. If the intention was to add up charges from such duplicate pixels, this is not done even in the current clusterizer code and instead only the last occurrence of a duplicate pixel is taken. Hence, this issue will have to be addressed on the Phase 2 pixel digitizer side.\r\n\r\nIn the data there could be some tiny differences in case some duplicate pixels appear.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles :)\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1660086498", "comments": 67, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1649877274", "deletions": 7, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "bug-fix", "orp-approved", "urgent", "code-checks-approved", "trk-dpg-approved", "trk"], "merge_commit_sha": "4b62bdb5e0d3475adcda1c386a8fb2c8b4d57948", "merged_at": "1660086498", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 37559, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 12, "state": "closed", "title": "Remove duplicate pixels", "updated_at": "1660086498", "user": "ferencek"}

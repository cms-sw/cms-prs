This is OK for phase 1 of the multithreaded framework, except in the case of a secondary input source. This is because a secondary input source may open a new input file during any primary event.  This pull request modifies the ROOT/EDM input source so that it registers nothing if it is being used as a secondary input source.  This request does nothing for other input sources, but this is OK for now as the ROOT/EDM input source is the only source currently used for secondary input.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1377166754", "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1377106362", "deletions": 14, "labels": ["core-approved", "fully-signed"], "merge_commit_sha": "b95763b0343a17daf5f412cf1da5f4e16e305cf9", "merged_at": "1377166754", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_0_0_pre3", "number": 585, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Secondary input sources should not register anything when opening a file", "updated_at": "1406900644", "user": "wmtan"}

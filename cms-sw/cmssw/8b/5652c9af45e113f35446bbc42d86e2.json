If either times are zero, the plain non-zero time is chosen instead;\r\n3. in case the flags for the rechits in the surrounding cells were invalid, set them to a valid state.\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** Requires a txt file that contains offsets to identify the calibration-to-surrounding cell `offset` given a certain module `typecode`, `roc` and `halfroc` numbers. Such a file is being added to cms-data ([this PR](https://github.com/cms-data/Geometry-HGCalMapping/pull/3)).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nAs reported [here](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1524428/#2-combining-calibration-and-su).", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "comments": 10, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1744201913", "deletions": 14, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "alca-pending", "db-pending", "geometry-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "upgrade-pending", "requires-external", "code-checks-approved", "heterogeneous-pending", "hgcal-dpg-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 47829, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 8, "state": "open", "title": "Add treatment of HGCAL calibration and surrounding cells", "updated_at": "1744380466", "user": "RSalvatico"}

The LUTs were deployed at P5 on July 1st, but they are not used in the emulator yet. \r\n\r\nThis PR needs the LUTs in https://github.com/cms-data/L1Trigger-L1TMuon/pull/25 to work.\r\n\r\nWe see improvement in EMTF performance at P5 with these new LUTs, so changes to muon efficiencies etc are expected when testing the re-emulation workflows from recent runs.\r\n\r\nThis is a backport of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/42198 \r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with a description of the feature proposed or problem addressed, specifying:\r\n  - what changes are expected in the output if any, \r\n  - what other PRs or externals it depends upon if any,\r\n  - link to any additional material useful to provide a documentation for this PR (slides, JIRA tickets, related pull requestes, hypernews, TWiki or Indico pages)  -->\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nValidated by comparing unpacked and re-emulated collections from recent runs.

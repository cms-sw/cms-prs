It consists of a few plots just to test the idea of visualization for this new class. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe code was tested by a script  testPPSTimingCalibration.sh (which is mostly based on getPayloadData.py from CondCore/Utilities) just to check whether the code is properly added to PI software and generate some proper data in JSON files produced by PI (there is also script  graph_check.py that visualize data in matplotlib).  \r\nIn case of testing - testPPSTimingCalibration.sh script should be run with 'run' argument.\r\n\r\n#### PR backport:\r\nNo backport.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 8, "comments": 17, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1659345065", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["alca-pending", "db-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "new-feature", "code-checks-approved", "ctpps"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 38915, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 10, "state": "open", "title": "Add new class PPSTimingCalibration for Payload Inspector", "updated_at": "1659452098", "user": "Kszemka"}

MLPF-specific event content is removed, as now MLPF produces PFCandidates instead of (rather than in parallel to) PFAlgo, when enabled.\r\n\r\nHere are the igprof results:\r\n- memory: https://jpata.web.cern.ch/jpata/cgi-bin/igprof-navigator/mlpf_v2/ig_mem\r\n- CPU: https://jpata.web.cern.ch/jpata/cgi-bin/igprof-navigator/mlpf_v2/ig_cpu\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nFor physics validation, please see the slides linked above. The integration can be tested in the workflows 11843.13 and 11834.13.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 11, "comments": 17, "commits": 11, "created_at": "1643618837", "deletions": 148, "labels": ["dqm-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "upgrade-pending", "requires-external", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 36841, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Updated MLPF producer with ONNX", "updated_at": "1644241542", "user": "jpata"}

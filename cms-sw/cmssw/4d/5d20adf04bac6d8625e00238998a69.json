This meant that the \"ignore\" code (-1) would be configured to \"require ecal driven\" (1). \r\n\r\nThis has no impact in any official E/g ID as its never set to ignore (only the case when you want it ignored in the barrel and not the endcap or vice versa would have this). Still it should be fixed. No need for any backports. \r\n\r\nAt the same time, I made the whole thing more robust against user config errors, to the point it will now throw an exception and a clear message if the config file passes in something other -1,0,1 for the cut value.\r\n\r\nOut of ~7000 DY events, no changes in the number of electrons passing the HEEP V60 ID (which uses this cut) is observed.

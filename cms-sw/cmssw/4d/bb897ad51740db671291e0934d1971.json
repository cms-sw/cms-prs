Legacy implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/RecoLocalTracker/SiPixelRecHits/src/PixelCPEGeneric.cc#L300-L335) and [here](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/CondFormats/SiPixelTransient/src/SiPixelGenError.cc#L758-L773). The feature may be used to study how much the IBC will help with generic CPE algorithm at high irradiation doses and may be turned on if favorable.\r\n\r\nThe PR also includes a bug fix in the SiPixelRecHits/src/PixelCPEFastParamsHost.cc where template error parameters would be loaded at incorrect charge categories for certain modules. Small changes in standard workflows are expected as the errors of the RecHit positions on affected modules will differ.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRan \"11634.402\" upgrade workflow in CMSSW_14_1_0_pre1 on 1000 events. Compared the results of \"step3_RAW2DIGI_RECO_VALIDATION_DQM\" with and without IBC using `harvestTrackValidationPlots.py` and `makeTrackValidationPlots.py`. Comparison can be found [here](https://mrogulji.web.cern.ch/mrogulji/plots_ibc_on_off/index.html). Some effects to tracking are observerd, but no major changes, which was expected.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

Legacy implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/RecoLocalTracker/SiPixelRecHits/src/PixelCPEGeneric.cc#L300-L335) and [here](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/CondFormats/SiPixelTransient/src/SiPixelGenError.cc#L758-L773). This option is not used by default in CMSSW workflows so no change is expected. The feature may be used to study how much the IBC will help with generic CPE algorithm at high irradiation doses.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRan \"11634.402\" upgrade workflow in CMSSW_14_1_0_pre1 on 1000 events. Compared the results of \"step3_RAW2DIGI_RECO_VALIDATION_DQM\" with and without IBC using `harvestTrackValidationPlots.py` and `makeTrackValidationPlots.py`. Comparison can be found [here](https://mrogulji.web.cern.ch/mrogulji/plots_ibc_on_off/index.html). Some effects to tracking are observerd, but no major changes, which was expected.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

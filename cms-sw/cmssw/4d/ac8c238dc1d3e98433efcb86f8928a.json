As this\nis the thread which caused the SEGV in the first place, it made the\nsigstack printer less-than-useful.\n\nWe were not able to identify why it worked with the CLONE_VFORK in\nsome cases.\n\nFurther, we observed that instances exiting with SEGV/BUS/ILL always\nreturned exit status 134 (SIGABRT).  This rethrows the signal in\norder to get the correct exit status.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1440042375", "comments": 12, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1440013845", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["comparison-available", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "79c891fa95eb2c0c03d321546aa590a16771b2cc", "merged_at": "1440042375", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 10864, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix sigstack printer.", "updated_at": "1440042375", "user": "bbockelm"}

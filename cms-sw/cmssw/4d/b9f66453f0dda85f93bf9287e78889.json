There is a minor side effect in that fewer debug printouts will occur when the previously-second \"if\" evaluates to false, so that the previously-first \"if\" (which would produce the printout) is skipped.\nAll plots are ttbar at 140 pileup in Shashlik; \"before\" plots include #4909.\n\n**Total event times before and after**\n![shashlikrecotimer-afterlangesuggestion-eventtotal](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6480160/3884299/4a5ea692-21ad-11e4-8df1-31208a665e06.png)\nThis equates to a drop from 6.1+/-1.7 minutes to 5.9+/-1.8 minutes per event (mean+/-sqrt(variance)). Doesn't sound that impressive when stated like that, but they're the same events not random data.\n\n**User time by module before**\n![shashlikrecotimer-beforelangesuggestion](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6480160/3884333/e458c354-21ad-11e4-8e8b-9dfb4e4c2b3b.png)\n\n**User time by module after**\n![shashlikrecotimer-afterlangesuggestion](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6480160/3884337/ed3f8160-21ad-11e4-8d62-9c2fd3c57fcb.png)\n\nSome modules appear to slightly increase in time (e.g. particleFlowTmp, particleFlowEGamma) but others significantly decrease (particleFlowBlock).  I'm not sure how accurate the timing is so I suspect this is just noise.\n\nUpdated igprof file at /afs/cern.ch/user/g/grimes/public/SLHC16_patch1Preview/igreport_perf_ShashlikRecoAfterLangeSuggestion_15evt.res\n@davidlange6, @lgray\n", "branch": "CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1407921165", "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1407792741", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "c2a0f81a6e41a84fdad57e873cb7128648c253e3", "merged_at": "1407921165", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "number": 4924, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Small Shashlik reco speed improvement", "updated_at": "1422006061", "user": "mark-grimes"}

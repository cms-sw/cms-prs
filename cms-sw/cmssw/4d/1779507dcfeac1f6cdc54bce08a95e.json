However, two of the files contained a specification of a typedef that resolved to the same class.  In ROOT6, this causes a duplicate definition linking error.  The fix is to comment out one of the dictionary specifications with an explanation that it is a duplicate.  This resolves the link error.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_ROOT6_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1384809773", "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1384809592", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "bdc1a9835d10c8f3b34b5cbe2e8be506c8e4af8a", "merged_at": "1384809773", "merged_by": "davidlt", "number": 1506, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Remove duplicate dictionary in DataFormats/TauReco", "updated_at": "1406908555", "user": "wmtan"}

For the specified mother (`ParticleID`) it checks if there are at least `NumberDaughters` daughter particles and exactly `NumberDaughters` daughters that satisfies the specific eta & pt cuts.  ( the gamma multiplicity of Bs->Mu Mu Gamma decay in the validation section)\r\n\r\nFor detailed context  on the issue please see the slides from the BPH Trigger meeting  [here](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1019671/contributions/4280967/attachments/2211280/3742378/bs2mumugamma_BPH_TRIGGER_MEETING_18Mar2021.pdf)( tldr : see slides  6,7,8 )\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe validation was done by using the deacy Bs->Mu+ Mu- Gamma, using PythiaDauVFilter and the PythiaAllDauVFilter\r\n\r\n**_With PythiaDauVFilter filter_**\r\n![photonMultiplicity](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32837065/114396274-029d8780-9bbb-11eb-8260-ba0760dad5d5.png)\r\n\r\n**_For PythiaAllDauVFilter filter_**\r\n![photonMultiplicity](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32837065/114395314-d46b7800-9bb9-11eb-8771-d739b0a75a94.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1619566707", "comments": 13, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1619084162", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["fully-signed", "generators-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "e731e1707f14572a77b63ab2a444d4cc3f6d6820", "merged_at": "1619566707", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 33502, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "All daughter decay filter", "updated_at": "1619566708", "user": "ats2008"}

It turns out the reason was that the TagProbeTreeProducer can silently ignore exceptions when filling branches. In our case, a ValueMap was not available anymore in newer CMSSW which went unnoticed for days due to the exception ignoring.\r\n\r\nI suggest to remove this feature from CMSSW because I think it does more harm than good, and it's probably harder to convince all users to set `ignoreExceptions =  cms.bool (False)` than to just change it upstream.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1549356154", "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1548948667", "deletions": 25, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "34af7391b5c8c73f0dea985f6982527facf54109", "merged_at": "1549356154", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_5_X", "number": 25823, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "No more possibility to ignore exceptions in TagAndProbe", "updated_at": "1549356154", "user": "guitargeek"}

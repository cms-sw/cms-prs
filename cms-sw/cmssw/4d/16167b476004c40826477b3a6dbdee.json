The links are added at both RECO/AOD and MiniAOD levels.\r\n\r\nAt RECO/AOD level the link is created by a dedicated \"modifier\" plugin which adds to a tau object edm::Ptrs to members of (general)track collection, while at miniAOD level it is done via modified PATTauSlimmer module which stores in tau object edm::Ptrs to members of lostTracks collection. In both cases already existing data members of respectively reco::BaseTau and  pat::Tau objects are reused. Linking at RECO/AOD is needed to produce link at miniAOD.\r\n\r\nExpected changes: small number of taus (<1%) will contain up to 2 additional edm::Ptrs. Other tau features will stay unchanged.    \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nStandard tests, i.e. runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos, passed successfully.\r\n\r\nBackward-compatibility checks: updated CMSSW code reads successfully old data thanks to unchanged structure of data members of tau classes (of course vectors of Ptrs to lost tracks are always empty).\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 9, "comments": 35, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1652344970", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved", "xpog-pending", "tau"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 37918, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 6, "state": "open", "title": "link lost tracks to taus", "updated_at": "1652694145", "user": "mbluj"}

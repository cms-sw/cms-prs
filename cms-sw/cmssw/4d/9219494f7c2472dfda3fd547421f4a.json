The original description was\r\n\r\nUpdated ParameterDescription in EcalUncalibRecHitWorkerMultiFit.cc to show crossCorrelationMethod parameters\r\n\r\n**PR description**:\r\nParameterDescription in EcalUncalibRecHitWorkerMultiFit.cc was not updated to reflect transition to crossCorrelationMethod as default ECAL rechit time reconstruction. ParameterDescription where updated.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe only small update I made here is that the same configuration file cleaning is propagated also to the configuration modules of all the other EcalUncalibRecHitProducer's. with the intent to **avoid duplicated files with the same name** in cmssw. In the oringinal PR that is applied only to ecalMultiFitUncalibRecHit_cfi.py, thus remaining with some asymmetry between the configuration of those sibling producers.\r\n\r\nNo difference is expected in output anywhere, otherwise it means that there is a discrepancy somewhere between the parameters in the fillDescription() methods of the different algorithms and the ones that were listed in the explicit configs (I verified that it was not the case... but it is always better to check it).\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 11, "comments": 4, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1692166748", "deletions": 211, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_3_X", "number": 42579, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Updated ParameterDescription in EcalUncalibRecHitWorkerMultiFit.cc, and clean up some other configs", "updated_at": "1692177202", "user": "perrotta"}

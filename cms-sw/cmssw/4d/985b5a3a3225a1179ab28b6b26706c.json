If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nFor the moment no backport is foreseen, might happen at a later time.\r\n\r\ncc:\r\n@consuegs @henriettepetersen ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 8, "comments": 12, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1679496634", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["alca-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "trk"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_1_X", "number": 41129, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 4, "state": "open", "title": "Update `AlignableTracker` for phase-2 Outer Tracker", "updated_at": "1680186447", "user": "mmusich"}

The plan has been raised in the [2025 Annual Trigger Review](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1597088/contributions/6738695/attachments/3167217/5629246/2025-10-31_2026TriggerReview_HLTScouting.pdf) and discussed in recent scouting round tables.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Description of the current change\r\n\r\n- Filter-by-filter efficiency monitoring, mainly to provide the hint for origins of observed efficiency difference.\r\n- Update scouting ID, basically removed the isolation cut + some minor optimization of the variables (based on the study of scouting cutbased ID reported in [EGM meeting](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1610914/contributions/6788708/attachments/3178779/5653835/ScoutingElectron%20Cutbased%20ID.pdf)).

Modules were updated to global where possible (no mutable state required, or mutable state could be avoided with straightforward code changes) and stream otherwise (when a mutable state of the class was unavoidable). In some cases, code edits were necessary to remove thread-unsafe practices.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 15, "closed_at": "1491458631", "comments": 15, "commits": 15, "created_at": "1490968596", "deletions": 420, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "7c4c6555d3f121c0ca55eaa09b91076ceb83b250", "merged_at": "1491458631", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_1_X", "number": 18153, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 5, "state": "closed", "title": "Update legacy modules in CommonTools, RecoMET, RecoJets", "updated_at": "1491458631", "user": "kpedro88"}

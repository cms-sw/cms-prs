The update of `hltIntegrationTests` is minimal, to simply make use of the new functionalities of `hltListPaths` (plus, a related update to `hltCompareResults` was also needed).\r\n\r\nRegarding (2):\r\n\r\n - the EDM file was copied to the TSG area on EOS in order to avoid issues with remote file access, which seems to have caused trouble lately in IBs (see the failure of the HLT Validation tests for [CMSSW_12_3_X_2022-03-19-1100](https://cmssdt.cern.ch/SDT/jenkins-artifacts/HLT-Validation/CMSSW_12_3_X_2022-03-19-1100/slc7_amd64_gcc10/RelVal_L1RePack_GRun_DATA.log)).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTSG tests.\r\n\r\nExample command for (1):\r\n```sh\r\nhltListPaths /users/missirol/test/dev/CMSSW_12_3_0/CMSHLT_2245/IntegTest_v01/HLT -p --no-dep --exclude \"^HLTriggerFinalPath$\" \"^Dataset_.+\" \"^Status_.+\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nN/A", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 2, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1647809044", "deletions": 44, "labels": ["hlt-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 37283, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "update of `hltIntegrationTests` and path of Run-3 Data file for TSG tests", "updated_at": "1647809384", "user": "missirol"}

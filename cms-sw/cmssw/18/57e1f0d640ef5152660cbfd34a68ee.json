This goes together with PR https://github.com/cms-data/L1Trigger-CSCTriggerPrimitives/pull/6.\r\n* The lookup tables were organized into CCLUT, GEMCSC and ME11.\r\n   * CCLUT: comparator code LUT algorithm that provides better position and bending resolution\r\n   * GEMCSC: GEM-CSC integrated trigger\r\n   * ME11: ME11 specific LUTs for ALCTs crossing with CLCTs\r\n* `CSCComparatorCodeLUT` renamed to `CSCLUTReader` so we can reuse it for the GEM-CSC trigger\r\n* Helper classes `CSCALCTCrossCLCT`, `GEMInternalCluster` and `LCTQualityAssignment` were added.\r\n   * `CSCALCTCrossCLCT`: class that checks if an ALCT crosses with a CLCT. Not always the case for ME1/1. A lengthy description was added when this class would be used\r\n   * `GEMInternalCluster`: transient container for `GEMPadDigiCluster` and a coincidence of two `GEMPadDigiCluster`s. We will shortly be doing the GEM-CSC matching based on `GEMPadDigiCluster` instead of `GEMPadDigi` and `GEMCoPadDigi`, like in the firmware. The emulator would no longer decluster into single pads. The `GEMInternalCluster` will eliminate much of the code duplication that exists now, and nearly all of the horrible function templating.\r\n   * `LCTQualityAssignment`: class that holds the definitions for LCT quality in Run-2 and Run-3. Documented in DN-20-016. Idea is to unload this code from the TMB classes.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested with WF 11634.0.

See e.g. #11809 or #11770.  This was taken out in commit https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/commit/92a11d05ec452e107f39267632f9164e998d5650, from November 2013.  I'm a little bemused that this hasn't shown up before.  The tag I've used is the last value from then, for the case of unit tests I doubt it matters that the tag is so old.\n\nSubmitting to SLHC branch because it should then also be auto-ported to SLHCDEV.\n\n@davidlange6 (original author of commit above), do you think it's okay to add `startup` back, or too risky in case someone inadvertently uses it for any \"real\" use?  Other options are to change all unit tests to use one of `upgrade2017`, `upgrade2019` or `upgradePLS3`; or to disable unit tests for SLHC and SLHCDEV.  For the former it would clash with the geometry the tests use, the latter option I would think is not desirable.  Could also keep the value but change the name to something like `teststartup`?\n", "branch": "CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1447685225", "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1445338429", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["alca-pending", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-rejected"], "milestone": "Next CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "number": 11984, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix unit tests that require the \"startup\" autoCond", "updated_at": "1447685231", "user": "mark-grimes"}

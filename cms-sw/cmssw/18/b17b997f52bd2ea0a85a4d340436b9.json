The fix is in the codes emulating the RPC clusterization,  it corrects the handling of some corner cases.\r\nWith this fix, the data-to-emulator agreement should improve by about 1% and be better than 99%.\r\n\r\nRather urgent - would be good to have it soon in the DQM (for the first collisions).\r\n\r\nModified files:\r\nRpcClusterization::getClusters: sort() called in all cases\r\n\r\nOMTFinputMaker.cc RpcDigiToStubsConverterOmtf::addRPCstub: fix in setting MuonStub::RPC_DROPPED\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nThe data-to-emulator agreement was checked running a private instance of the DQM for a cosmic run from the February CRAFT, the data-to-emulator agreement improved by ~1%.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\nit is not a backport.

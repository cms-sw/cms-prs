To do this,\r\n--> The beam mode information is obtained from TCDS Digis copying the method used by central DQM for plots in Info/LHCInfo.\r\n--> A DQM_KIND_REAL is filled in the trigger primitives task to store the LHC status mode by lumisection\r\n--> This value is read by the trigger primitives client, and the check on average occupancy in a supermodule is performed only if this value is 11 (i.e. collisions)\r\n\r\nThis was done because over the last several months, we have increasingly seen \"warm\" towers during cosmics that trigger an alarm on anomalously high occupancies in a supermodule. The thresholds for setting off this alarm were tuned for collisions runs; such false alarms during cosmics runs lead to unnecessary confusion for the DQM shifter.\r\n\r\nPlease note that at this moment, there is another pending PR to 9_2_X that does not interfere with this one: https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/20901 , which is currently stuck pending https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/20902 , which I'm working on fixing.\r\n\r\nLink to the corresponding PR CMSSW master: https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/21115", "branch": "CMSSW_9_2_X", "changed_files": 9, "closed_at": "1513937580", "comments": 8, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1509532745", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_9_2_X", "number": 21114, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Cosmics false alarm fix+2D super crystal binning fix (for CMSSW version deployed in production at P5)", "updated_at": "1513937580", "user": "tanmaymudholkar"}

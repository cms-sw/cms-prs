As I was reading through the code for something else, I noticed we had missed some places where the name DataProxy or proxy was still in use and I migrated all that to use ESProductResolver or resolver. This is just renaming so it should not affect behavior. It makes it easier to read this code without mentally context switching between the two names...\r\n\r\nAt the same time, I made a few other minor cleanup fixes in the files I touched: Doxygen class declarations are now in a namespace, emacs C++ directive is now on the top line (does nothing otherwise), and a few typos in comments fixed.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCore unit tests pass.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 29, "comments": 4, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1727899540", "deletions": 178, "labels": ["core-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-rejected", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_2_X", "number": 46204, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "More of the DataProxy to ESProductResolver renaming", "updated_at": "1727912464", "user": "wddgit"}

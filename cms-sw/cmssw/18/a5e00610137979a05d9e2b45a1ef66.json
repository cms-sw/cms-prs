Currently a set of HLT paths was evaluated and the histograms were filled only if the events passed at least one of them.\r\n\r\nPhase-2 HLT menu development (see https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/40412) would reduce the statistics in the EXO DQM histograms as shown in [1]. To avoid this decrease and provided that trigger evaluation do not provide significant insight into the validation of offline objects, we have converged into removing the trigger requirement.\r\n\r\nImpact in Phase-2 can be studied by testing together with https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/40412 \r\n@srimanob\r\n\r\n[1] https://indico.cern.ch/event/1243344/\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis PR passed all unit tests and the full standard battery of runTheMatrix workflows:\r\nrunTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos\r\n\r\nIt was checked that the current HLT menu let all the events of the relval samples pass and fill the histograms. No changes are expected in the validation plots with respect to the previous EXO DQM configuration. The number of events that fired these triggers is shown in the attached plots for three different relval samples that are often used in EXO validation:\r\n\r\n![trigger_triggeredEvents_QCD](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29282388/216104046-ba8c658e-297a-4731-9ede-660d88313707.png)\r\n![trigger_triggeredEvents_SingleMu](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29282388/216104074-9b942560-0645-4e53-a644-c8bec428f804.png)\r\n![trigger_triggeredEvents_ZEE](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29282388/216104090-17c6a939-9df3-44fb-a2d5-0153cee5fa1e.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

This PR adds DQM modules (`GEMCSCSegmentSource` and `GEMCSCSegmentClient`) to monitor GE1/1 detection efficiency using `GEMCSCSegment` in the online DQM. This PR is technically slightly different from the original PR but has no effect in the view of DQM output. In the original PR, the new `GEMCSCSegmentSource` module is derived from `GEMOfflineDQMBase`, which is derived from `DQMEDAnalyzer` again and provides technical helper methods. `GEMOfflineDQMBase` exists in the same package `DQM/GEM` since 12_3_X but in the `DQMOffline/Muon` package in 12_2_X. Also, `DQMOffline/Muon` is not built as a public shared library. Therefore, since 12_2_X is a closed production release, I make `GEMCSCSegmentSource` standalone (i.e. directly derived from `DQMEDAnalyzer`) in this PR to minimize changes. Please tell me if the exact backport is required.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nThis PR is tested with the following recipe on lxplus.\r\n```bash\r\ncmsrel CMSSW_12_2_X_2022-04-03-2300\r\ncd CMSSW_12_2_X_2022-04-03-2300/src\r\ncmsenv\r\ngit-cms-merge-topic seungjin-yang:GEMEffByGEMCSCSegment__from-CMSSW_12_2_X_2022-04-03-2300\r\nscram b -j4\r\ncmsRun ${CMSSW_BASE}/src/DQM/Integration/python/clients/gem_dqm_sourceclient-live_cfg.py unitTest=True\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\nBackport of #37341.

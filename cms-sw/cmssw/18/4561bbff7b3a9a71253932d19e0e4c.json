Due to the dependency on \"BTauGenericMVAJetTagComputerRcd\" and \"JetTagComputerRecord\", the corresponding b-tagging computers need to be masked in run3. Only DNN taggers will be the only supported ones in run3. To accommodate the change, this PR changes the discriminator to \"pfDeepCSVJetTag:probb\" in patMuon and patDisplacedMuon with Era Modifier for Run 3.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nPR tested locally with runTheMatrix with Run3 era and 125X_mcRun3_2022_realistic_Queue condition on 11603.0 and native run 3 tests 312.0, 139.001 and 13234.0.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

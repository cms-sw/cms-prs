As far as AlCa is able to determine, [no one is interested](https://hypernews.cern.ch/HyperNews/CMS/get/calibrations/4342.html) using a cosmic GT with the conditions that were projected to represent the conditions at Run 2 startup. On the other hand, a cosmic GT that represents realistic conditions detector conditions is of interest to the tracker community in the context of the legacy reprocessing.\r\n\r\nThe GT diff with respect to the corresponding pp collision GT:\r\n\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/112X_mcRun2_asymptotic_v1/112X_mcRun2cosmics_asymptotic_deco_v1\r\n\r\nshows that the only differences are the L1T tags and (irrelevant for cosmics) tau tags. The difference with respect to the GT modeling startup conditions involves only alignment and bad channel tags:\r\n\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/112X_mcRun2cosmics_startup_deco_v1/112X_mcRun2cosmics_asymptotic_deco_v1\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe change is one of definition so there isn't anything to validate, aside from a technical test: `runTheMatrix.py -l 7.22 --ibeos`\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nThis PR is not a backport but will be backported to 10_6_X, as it is of interest to the legacy reprocessing.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1603120306", "comments": 12, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1603070057", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-rejected"], "merge_commit_sha": "8ca5e24fc7e35c3abc3abf13fc8fcf8c205846c7", "merged_at": "1603120306", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 31846, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Introduce scenario for 2016 cosmics with realistic conditions", "updated_at": "1603120306", "user": "christopheralanwest"}

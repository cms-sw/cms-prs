Before the aforementioned IB these EDProducers were moved from Sequence to Task by `convertToUnscheduled()`, which was removed in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/29630, leading to modules associated to a Path to depend on event products produced by producers in EndPath. The proposed fix is to move bunch of non-DQM EDProducers from Seqences to Tasks in L1T DQM and Validation configuration files.\r\n\r\nPart of  #30074, a second attempt of #30081.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nLimited matrix and workflows ` 134.801,134.802,134.803,134.804,134.805,134.806,134.807,134.808,134.809,134.81,134.811,134.812,134.901,134.902,134.903,134.904,134.905,134.906,134.907,134.908,134.909,134.91,134.911,134.912,134.99601,134.99602,134.99603,134.99901,140.55,145.0` run.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1591290847", "comments": 13, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1591142400", "deletions": 83, "labels": ["bug-fix", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "l1-pending", "orp-approved", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "urgent"], "merge_commit_sha": "888c58bacd456bd8ae6d3f15c389a7643a036e6e", "merged_at": "1591290847", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 30089, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Move EDProducers from Sequences to Tasks in L1T DQM and Validation configurations", "updated_at": "1591290847", "user": "makortel"}

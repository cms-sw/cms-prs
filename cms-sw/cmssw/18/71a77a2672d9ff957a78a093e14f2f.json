This is an update of PR #5314 which fixes the issues raised there. LumiInfoRunHeader now uses std::bitset to store the filling scheme information, and the beam intensities are now stored in 16 bits. This uses libminifloat, which is currently in DataFormats/PatCandidates -- it might be useful to move it to some central location.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_3_X", "changed_files": 14, "closed_at": "1415282845", "comments": 20, "commits": 14, "created_at": "1415116925", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "6ec1c0f6a312a6102cc5889fe3c5e406551ea192", "merged_at": "1415282845", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_3_X", "number": 6204, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 7, "state": "closed", "title": "LumiInfo classes for Run 2 luminosity information", "updated_at": "1415284594", "user": "plujan"}

In this PR these exceptions are converted to warnings.  \r\n\r\nHandling of Geant4 exception is changed: for each exception a dump of track parameters is added. This is needed, because not in all Geant4 exceptions G4Track information is given, or is given incomplete.\r\n\r\nIntroduce a new energy threshold. If a particle has kinetic energy blow the GeomNav0003 exceptions become JustWarning, track is killed, simulation continues.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nprivate\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "comments": 22, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1633600545", "deletions": 7, "labels": ["simulation-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "number": 35572, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Make Geant4 geometry exception to be just a warning", "updated_at": "1633787339", "user": "civanch"}

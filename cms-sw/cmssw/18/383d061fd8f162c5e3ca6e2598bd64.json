In this PR these exceptions are converted to warnings.  \r\n\r\nHandling of Geant4 exception is changed: for each exception a dump of track parameters is added. This is needed, because not in all Geant4 exceptions G4Track information is given, or is given incomplete.\r\n\r\nIntroduce a new energy threshold. If a particle has kinetic energy blow the GeomNav0003 exceptions become JustWarning, track is killed, simulation continues.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nprivate\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1633927267", "comments": 31, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1633600545", "deletions": 7, "labels": ["simulation-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "c6f8d39848ac837c5f6cad990885067491bf1c9a", "merged_at": "1633927266", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "number": 35572, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Make Geant4 geometry exception to be just a warning", "updated_at": "1633927267", "user": "civanch"}

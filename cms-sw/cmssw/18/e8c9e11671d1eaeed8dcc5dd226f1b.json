From a quick search I don't expect this to have unwanted effects elsewhere (note that this relates to the discussion in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/39958 as this is not the first time we've needed to introduce a different behaviour between Run2 and Run3 for things that were blindly inherited from the `Run2_2018` era to the `Run3` era, see e.g. https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/40209). \r\n    - @lathomas  FYI, it meant that the L1 prefiring weights applied in nanoAODv10 to Run3 samples were taken as the 2018UL ones (and still are in nanoV11 in 12_6_X), which is probably incorrect.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRan nano matrix workflows.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 32, "comments": 23, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1671090025", "deletions": 5003, "labels": ["operations-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "pdmv-approved", "upgrade-approved", "code-checks-approved", "xpog-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "number": 40321, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Nano: drop frozen V10 config, make triggerObjectTable more easily customizable", "updated_at": "1673354036", "user": "swertz"}

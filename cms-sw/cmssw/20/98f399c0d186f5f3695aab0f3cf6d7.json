It also includes some changes to add plots for the new hadronic showers.\r\n\r\nIn particular:\r\n- Removed zero suppression folder from uGMT DQM\r\n- Ignored BX range mismatches in uGMT muon copy comparisons. (We now read out only the central BX for the copies but +/-2 for the main outputs.)\r\n- Ignore BX range mismatches for the data-emulator comparisons for the same reason.\r\n- Move the main uGMT DQM plots behind the fat events filter as otherwise the BX distribution plots would be heavily biased towards the central BX. (Because only the central BX is read out in standard events for the inputs.)\r\n- Enable uGMT muon copy comparisons for all events (not just the validation events).\r\n- Remove alerting on incorrect zero suppression and disable BX range checks.\r\n- Add hadronic shower comparisons between the EMTF outputs and uGMT inputs\r\n- Add uGMT muon showers to DQM quality tests\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRan the usual `runTheMatrix` and `scram` checks.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "comments": 5, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1653847001", "deletions": 123, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 38115, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Adapt uGMT DQM for new readout menu following the disabling of the zero suppression", "updated_at": "1653849720", "user": "dinyar"}

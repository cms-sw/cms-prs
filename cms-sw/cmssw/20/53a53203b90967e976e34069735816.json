To do this with our profiling machinery, we need a \"production-like\" heavy-ion MC workflow, i.e., not including validation.\r\nThis PR adds such a workflow (159.03), and cleans up the numbering scheme of HI workflows slightly.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested with new workflow 159.03, and ensured that 159.0 and 159.02 were not broken by the migration. \r\n\r\nA backport to 12_5_X will probably be useful.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1662373092", "comments": 14, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1662018026", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["fully-signed", "tests-approved", "pdmv-approved", "orp-approved", "upgrade-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "c3b26e0cb857ef2629325f6522fb7c538351066f", "merged_at": "1662373092", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_6_X", "number": 39284, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "Add production-like Run 3 HI MC workflow to relval", "updated_at": "1662373092", "user": "mandrenguyen"}

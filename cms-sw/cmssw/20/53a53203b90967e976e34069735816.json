To do this with our profiling machinery, we need a \"production-like\" heavy-ion MC workflow, i.e., not including validation.\r\nThis PR adds such a workflow (159.03), and cleans up the numbering scheme of HI workflows slightly.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested with new workflow 159.03, and ensured that 159.0 and 159.02 were not broken by the migration. \r\n\r\nA backport to 12_5_X will probably be useful.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 2, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1662018026", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_6_X", "number": 39284, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "open", "title": "Add production-like Run 3 HI MC workflow to relval", "updated_at": "1662101544", "user": "mandrenguyen"}

The code loops over all photons and jets found in the event and multiplies their prefiring probabilities. \r\n\r\nI expect the PR to need a bit of iteration before being approved. \r\nIn particular, I would greatly appreciate your suggestions regarding the following points: \r\n\r\n- Can you please provide advise regarding the code location? I created a new package but it can/should maybe enter an already existing one?\r\n- The code relies on prefiring maps stored as TH2F in a root file. I'm not sure this is allowed... If not, can you suggest a proper format? (sorry for my ignorance). \r\n\r\nPlease let me know if anything else is unclear,\r\n\r\nThanks a lot, \r\n\r\nLaurent  \r\n\r\n***Documentation***\r\n-Talk at CMS week about prefiring: \r\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/704625/contributions/3164334/attachments/1726987/2790093/prefiringupdateCMSweek.pdf\r\n-Prefiring discussion at the XPOG forum: \r\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/764279/\r\n-Twiki describing how to run the producer:\r\nhttps://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/CMS/L1ECALPrefiringWeightRecipe\r\n-L1 prefiring maps per object:\r\nhttps://lathomas.web.cern.ch/lathomas/TSGStuff/L1Prefiring/PrefiringMaps_2016and2017/\r\n-Validation plots: \r\nhttps://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/pub/CMS/L1ECALPrefiringWeightRecipe/prefiring_producervalidation.pdf\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 81, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1543527444", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_5_X", "number": 25380, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 36, "state": "open", "title": "L1 prefiring weight producer ", "updated_at": "1547133635", "user": "lathomas"}

The SeedGeneratorFromProtoTracksEDProducer is adapted accordingly. The former constructors are kept for backward-compatibility. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTechnical PR but some regression expected at HLT level when pixel tracks are used as seeds and more hits are used (see also https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/36215).\r\n\r\nRun3 HLT tracking single iteration results documented [here](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1099590/contributions/4626741/attachments/2357907/4024340/TriggerReview_Dec21_TRK.pdf).\n\nAll tests run.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1643113292", "comments": 90, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1637334335", "deletions": 34, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "ec200b2e6d0213cdf868308a7a836be8912c4cbc", "merged_at": "1643113291", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 36184, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 26, "state": "closed", "title": "Extending SeedingHitSet & SeedGeneratorFromProtoTracksEDProducer", "updated_at": "1643113292", "user": "AdrianoDee"}

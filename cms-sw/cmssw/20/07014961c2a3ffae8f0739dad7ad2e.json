The SeedGeneratorFromProtoTracksEDProducer is adapted accordingly. The former constructors are kept for backward-compatibility. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTechnical PR but some regression expected at HLT level when pixel tracks are used as seeds and more hits are used (see also https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/36215).\r\n\r\nRun3 HLT tracking single iteration results documented [here](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1099590/contributions/4626741/attachments/2357907/4024340/TriggerReview_Dec21_TRK.pdf).\n\nAll tests run.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 83, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1637334335", "deletions": 34, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 36184, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 24, "state": "open", "title": "Extending SeedingHitSet & SeedGeneratorFromProtoTracksEDProducer", "updated_at": "1642093054", "user": "AdrianoDee"}

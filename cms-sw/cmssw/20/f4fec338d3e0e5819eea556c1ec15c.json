This causes failures to not be reported as failures in the IB.\nIn the ROOT 6 IB, there were approximately 15 test failures that were not noticed until now because of this.\nNOTE:  Since these code changes are not ROOT 6 specific, they are also being pull requested in the main 7_3_X branch for code commonality.\nPlease merge this request in the ROOT6 branch as soon as convenient.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_3_ROOT6_X", "changed_files": 11, "closed_at": "1415660108", "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1415646256", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["alca-pending", "comparison-pending", "db-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "bba6a90f624c81ef22a41751b1886aaff53f535d", "merged_at": "1415660108", "merged_by": "davidlt", "number": 6318, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "If test fails, return a non-zero exit code", "updated_at": "1415730228", "user": "wmtan"}

Python workflows are versioned and kept track of with MD5-sums + a human readable name. The version tracking needs significant improvement. If someone can help it would be great! I've taken some care to make sure that the ID functions can be configured and used within FWLite, I am working on making this functionality available in FWLite-python so that it can be used many levels of the analysis chain.\n\nThis framework needs to have significant content filled from more than electrons in before it becomes viable, but it's a start.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 70, "closed_at": "1408440995", "comments": 37, "commits": 35, "created_at": "1405530896", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-pending", "core-pending", "fastsim-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_0_X", "number": 4685, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 29, "state": "closed", "title": "Baseline of Common Isolation & ID Framework 70X Edition", "updated_at": "1408551286", "user": "lgray"}

Since the CrossingFrames are no longer required, the `DigiFullFastTimer` step has been removed and it now uses the normal `DigiFull` step.\nThe new collection adds ~31kb per event to the file size at 140 pileup, so the reco step has been changed to `RecoFull` and `RecoFullFastTimer` removed as well.  The only difference between the two was smaller event content in `RecoFullFastTimer`, and file size is no longer an issue.\nAs a reminder, the workflow numbers are 160xx.\n\n@simonepigazzini\n@boudoul, note this changes some of the workflows you introduced.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1430988563", "comments": 7, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1430946722", "deletions": 31, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "9de1443c72bce7555ae3d71f41634bbe51843eff", "merged_at": "1430988563", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "number": 8979, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Change fast timing workflows to stop using crossing frames", "updated_at": "1430988641", "user": "mark-grimes"}

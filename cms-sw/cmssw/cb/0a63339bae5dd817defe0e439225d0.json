However I thought it would be nice to have the rest of the PR available to also receive comments rather than waiting to explore that suggestion. \r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n```\r\n hltIntegrationTests v3-test/run3:/dev/CMSSW_12_0_0/Fake -s /dev/CMSSW_12_0_0/GRun -i /store/data/Run2018D/EphemeralHLTPhysics1/RAW/v1/000/323/790/00000/15FD6507-9B9A-DE49-973B-B63C4DEDC226.root -x  \"--globaltag auto:run3_hlt\" --dbproxy \r\nhltGetConfiguration v3-test/run3:/dev/CMSSW_12_0_0/Fake --dbproxy\r\nhltConfigFromDB --configName /dev/CMSSW_12_0_0/GRun/V1  --dbproxy --v3-test --run3\r\n ```\r\n\r\ncommands all work as expected at RAL (ie very much off the cern network)\r\n \r\n ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": "1636417121", "comments": 22, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1636040056", "deletions": 34, "labels": ["hlt-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "requires-external", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "6c723d3631939262fe0be9d400dae6d68fa40899", "merged_at": "1636417120", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_2_X", "number": 35987, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 11, "state": "closed", "title": "Adding Proxy Support to hltGetConfiguration and fixing converter/db specification bugs with hltIntegrationTests", "updated_at": "1636417121", "user": "Sam-Harper"}

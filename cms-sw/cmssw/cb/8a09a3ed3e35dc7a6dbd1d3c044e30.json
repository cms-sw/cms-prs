The new version is called v15.\r\nThe vertex association is adapted to deal with split vertices in high hadronic activity events (more on this here: https://indico.cern.ch/event/944339/contributions/3968152/attachments/2086414/3505127/splitverticesandhighptjets.pdf).\r\nCharged particles associated to one of the leading two pileup vertices by the vertex fit (fromPV=0), but found within dz<0.2 of the primary vertex are treated as coming from the primary vertex.\r\nThis reduces MET tails due to particles that are wrongly associated to a PU vertex, when the PV is reconstructed as 2-3 split vertices.\r\nThe overall impact on jet response, jet efficiency, fake rate, boosted object tagging is negligible.\r\nThus JEC and SFs derived with PUPPI v14 are applicable to PUPPI v15.\r\nA summary of the studies is in:\r\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/942994/contributions/3978585/attachments/2088015/3508036/puppiv15summary-1.pdf\r\nAn additional check on softdrop mass response for high pT AK8 jets can be found here:\r\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/942994/#7-virtual-impact-of-puppi-tune\r\n\r\nIn addition a \">\" to \">=\" change is made in PuppiContainer to properly handle rare cases with particle eta==0.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nscram b run-tests\r\nrunTheMatrix.py -l limited\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nPlan to backport to 10_6 for UL-re-MiniAOD: #31214", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1598055872", "comments": 25, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1597825763", "deletions": 18, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "50399f2e5cb879471d6e9faed4b822296de1a0dc", "merged_at": "1598055871", "merged_by": "qliphy", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 31174, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 4, "state": "closed", "title": "Adapt track-vertex association in PUPPI (v15)", "updated_at": "1598592060", "user": "ahinzmann"}

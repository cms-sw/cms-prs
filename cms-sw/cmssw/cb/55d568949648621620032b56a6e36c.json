(Of course, in the path : DQM/L1TMonitor/interface/L1TStage2uGT.h, we simply add the new histograms) These changes are mentioned to add some extra plots according to specific L1 Trigger bits (L1_FirstCollisionInTrain and L1_LastCollisionInTrain). So, after I initialize three plots, I used the last two trigger bits, as I mentioned, to fill them. The first plot which called first_bunch, selecting only the L1_FirstCollisionInTrain, is filled with all the algorithm trigger bits (y-axis) and BX (x-axis), the second plot which called last_bunch, selecting only the L1_LastCollisionInTrain, is filled with all the algorithm trigger bits (y-axis) and BX (x-axis), and the last plot called isolated_bunch is filled selecting simultaneously L1_FirstCollisionInTrain and L1_LastCollisionInTrain, is filled with all the algorithm trigger bits (y-axis) and BX (x-axis).", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1511020338", "comments": 40, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1508394346", "deletions": 11, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "7588885301099ac842c6e33c7cc3ef22d2f0bda7", "merged_at": "1511020338", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_0_X", "number": 20969, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "Dedicated timing plots for L1T objects - Online DQM & L1T - CMSSW_9_4_X", "updated_at": "1511020338", "user": "dtsitson"}

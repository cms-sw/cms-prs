The problem should be specific modules run in scheduled mode (i.e. modules are in Path or Sequence). Given that in all offline workflows the reconstruction code is run unscheduled, I limited to modules that I saw were in `HLT_GRun_cff`. I might have missed some, but I hope these changes would reduce the rate of the failures.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

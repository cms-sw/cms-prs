The problem was traced to:\nhttps://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/CMSSW_8_1_X/SimCalorimetry/CaloSimAlgos/interface/CaloTDigitizer.h#L130\n\n```\ntheHitResponse->clear();\n```\n\nThe same CaloHitResponse was being used for HF QIE8 and HF QIE10. Using separate CaloHitResponse objects solves the problem. This fix will be backported to 80X.\n\n2) In #13861, a bug was introduced in HcalDbHardcode: pedestals were set to 0 unless `fSmear` was enabled. This has been corrected. I also addressed a few lingering code review comments from @civanch that didn't make it into the previous PR. These fixes are 81X-only.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1461045950", "comments": 10, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1460744333", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["alca-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "e6dffbcd07b7189b52342c5a85c2bedea3315f46", "merged_at": "1461045950", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 14101, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "HCAL Phase1 bug fixes", "updated_at": "1461045950", "user": "kpedro88"}

There are 6 plots, 2 for each object ALCT/CLCT/LCT. For each object I have a 2D plot that shows the efficiency to correctly emulate the data objects, and a plot that shows the percentage of emulated objects that do not have a data counterpart. Emulated and data objects are compared with an `operator==` function, or a custom equality function.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested on 15k events of Run 322022. A few plots are shown below.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nN.A.\r\n\r\n@ptcox @tahuang1991 @giovanni-mocellin", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1637697145", "deletions": 324, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_2_X", "number": 36226, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Add 2D TPG data-vs-emulation summary plots for L1T CSC DQM", "updated_at": "1637737138", "user": "dildick"}

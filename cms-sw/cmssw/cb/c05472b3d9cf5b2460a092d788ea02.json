There are 6 plots, 2 for each object ALCT/CLCT/LCT. For each object I have a 2D plot that shows the efficiency to correctly emulate the data objects, and a plot that shows the percentage of emulated objects that do not have a data counterpart. Emulated and data objects are compared with an `operator==` function, or a custom equality function.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested on 15k events of Run 322022. A few plots are shown below. Plots with 26k events can be seen here: https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/36046#issuecomment-982223320\r\n\r\nPlots\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nN.A.\r\n\r\n@ptcox @tahuang1991 @giovanni-mocellin", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1637755613", "comments": 12, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1637697145", "deletions": 324, "labels": ["dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "0e2c382e6bad2b3379179449f57f376248befb18", "merged_at": "1637755613", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_2_X", "number": 36226, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add 2D TPG data-vs-emulation summary plots for L1T CSC DQM", "updated_at": "1638239170", "user": "dildick"}

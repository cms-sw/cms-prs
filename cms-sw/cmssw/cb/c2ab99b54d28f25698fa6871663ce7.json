Should restore the previous behavior of the linear look-up and aligns with the correctionlib lookup used in \r\nhttps://github.com/cms-jet/JECDatabase/tree/master/scripts/JEC2JSON\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRan local tests on consistency between new \"JSON corrections\" and cmssw. Now get full consistency over a scan of input parameters including bin-boundaries, out-of-range, etc. cases.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1626356437", "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1625657469", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "db-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "01d487d4754c436331e4cf3ba4cde503563b0a59", "merged_at": "1626356437", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "number": 34382, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix uppermost bin edge handling in non-linear lookup of JEC bins", "updated_at": "1626356438", "user": "kirschen"}

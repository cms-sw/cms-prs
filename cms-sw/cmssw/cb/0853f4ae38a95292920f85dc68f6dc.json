This gets reported in the summary and to the framework job report. Time is summed across all threads.\r\n\r\nAdditional changes:\r\n- Moved postESSyncIOV signal to run right after ESSources synchronize. This now properly encapsulate the time calling the ESSources.\r\n- Added beginProcessing and endProcessing signals to specify when starting/ending processing of source transitions.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nFramework unit tests pass.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 13, "closed_at": "1680873408", "comments": 31, "commits": 9, "created_at": "1680545929", "deletions": 45, "labels": ["core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "49b3df1092701862f4113e36e7c0c35b958ad1d7", "merged_at": "1680873408", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_13_1_X", "number": 41262, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 12, "state": "closed", "title": "Timing Service now measures time not running a Module", "updated_at": "1680873408", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

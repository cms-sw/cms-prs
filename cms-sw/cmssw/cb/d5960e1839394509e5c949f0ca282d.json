As a result is not easy to determine which ALCT and CLCT where involved in the LCT construction. In particular in Phase-2 scenarios where GEMPadDigis are combined with CSCALCTDigi and/or CSCCLCTDigi it becomes even more complicated to determine where the CSCCorrelatedLCTDigis came from. This pull request will make the task of debugging the emulator much easier.\r\n\r\nI added a member `type_` which can be \r\n* CLCT-ALCT (classic case)\r\n* ALCT-CLCT (upgrade case for MEX/1)\r\n* ALCT-CLCT-1GEM (1 GEM pad)\r\n* ALCT-CLCT-2GEM (GEM coincidence pad)\r\n* ALCT-2GEM (substitute CLCT for GEM coincidence pad)\r\n* CLCT-2GEM (substitute ALCT for GEM coincidence pad)\r\n\r\nIn addition I added members to get the original CSCALCTDigi, CSCCLCTDigi and GEMPadDigi. \r\n\r\nFinally I deleted two implementations of `constructLCTs`, one in CSCMotherBoardME11, one in CSCMotherBoardME11GEM. Both were unused in the algorithm.\r\n\r\n@Dr15Jones Referring to the discussion on the Framework and Edm Development HN, I find this implementation much more straightforward and easier to implement. Which is why I opted not to use edm::Ref. \r\n\r\n@tahuang1991", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 11, "closed_at": "1503587860", "comments": 20, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1500355799", "deletions": 102, "labels": ["code-checks-pending", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-pending", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "13b1b87d557b8866a4f5647121027ad2a1c70f40", "merged_at": "1503587860", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_3_X", "number": 19786, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Extra members in CSCCorrelatedLCTDigi to determine its original components", "updated_at": "1504722070", "user": "dildick"}

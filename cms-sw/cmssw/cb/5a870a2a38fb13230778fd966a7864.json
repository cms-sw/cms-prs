First the function is only\r\ncalled when the LuminosityBlockAuxiliary has an\r\ninvalid beginTime and the Framework is trying to\r\nfix it by getting the time from the first event\r\nin that lumi. The bug might cause it to get the\r\nwrong event and there is a remote chance this event\r\ncould be from the wrong run. But for the wrong\r\nevent to be selected, the lumi has to be fragmented\r\nover multiple lumi entries in the lumi TTree and\r\nthat only happens after after a lumi was split over\r\nmultiple files and then merged together in a noncontiguous\r\norder. It can also happen running in a mode using\r\nmultiple concurrent luminosity blocks.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1527875169", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["code-checks-pending", "comparison-pending", "core-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 23424, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Bug fix in IndexIntoFileItrImpl::firstEventEntryThisLumi", "updated_at": "1527875203", "user": "wddgit"}

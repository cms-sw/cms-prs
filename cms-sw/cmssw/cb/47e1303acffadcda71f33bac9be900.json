(Though prompt L1 track reco will run OK without these).\r\ni) https://github.com/cms-data/L1Trigger-TrackTrigger/pull/2\r\nii) https://github.com/cms-data/L1Trigger-TrackFindingTracklet/pull/5\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe L1 tracking performance remains as expected. And CPU use is reduced.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 256, "comments": 34, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1654976452", "deletions": 2546, "labels": ["l1-pending", "simulation-approved", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "new-package-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 38341, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "L1 track bit accurate KF track fit emulation + other improvements", "updated_at": "1660074167", "user": "tomalin"}

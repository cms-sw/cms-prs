(Though prompt L1 track reco will run OK without these).\r\ni) https://github.com/cms-data/L1Trigger-TrackTrigger/pull/2\r\nii) https://github.com/cms-data/L1Trigger-TrackFindingTracklet/pull/5\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe L1 tracking performance remains as expected. And CPU use is reduced.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 256, "closed_at": "1665657397", "comments": 81, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1654976452", "deletions": 2552, "labels": ["l1-approved", "simulation-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "upgrade-approved", "requires-external", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "c176438492551e02af696fe09835a6285d6526b2", "merged_at": "1665657397", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_6_X", "number": 38341, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 35, "state": "closed", "title": "L1 track bit accurate KF track fit emulation + other improvements", "updated_at": "1665657397", "user": "tomalin"}

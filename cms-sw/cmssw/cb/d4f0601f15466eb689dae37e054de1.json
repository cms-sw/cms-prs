These have similar performance, but are much better behaved as a function of jet pt and mass. However, we prefer to use the GROOMED observables, so this comes with two necessary code changes:\r\n\r\n1. applySubstructure in MiniAOD: Need to move the AK8 PF jets with puppi and soft drop to the top of the file. We then run ECFs on the AK8 Puppi soft-dropped collection, and store as user floats. Then, we need to merge the soft-dropped version with the ungroomed version for final storage. \r\n\r\n2. JetSubstructurePacker: To accomplish the merging of soft-dropped ECFs with the ungroomed version, we also need to \"forward\" the userFloats from the pat::Jets that are soft-dropped into the ungroomed collection. \r\n\r\nThe rest are the updates of the ECFs themselves. Once this is integrated, we will prepare a backport to 9.2.x to take advantage of upcoming MINIAOD reproductions.

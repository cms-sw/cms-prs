While it does not really add anything for workflows with both HARVESTING and ALCA, it does add flexibility to workflows without ALCA (like all 2023 ones) by not fixing the RECO+DQM+VALIDATION step to be number 3. This feature will be needed for combined premixing stage1+stage2 workflow (where RECO will be step 4).\r\n\r\nTested in CMSSW_10_2_X_2018-04-12-2300, no changes expected.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 10, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1524048476", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "upgrade-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 22997, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Switch the order of HARVESTING and ALCA steps for upgrade workflows", "updated_at": "1524058859", "user": "makortel"}

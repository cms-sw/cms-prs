These obsolete functions and associated configurations should not have to be maintained in the future. They also make it hard to navigate a file with with >3000 lines. It is better to remove them. I am also removing a few obsolete test files.\r\n\r\nIn future PRs I would like to \r\n- remove the parameters `isTMB07` and `isMTCC`. \r\n- undo the decoupling of CLCTs and LCTs in ME1a and ME1b in upgrade scenarios (an interesting idea ~7 year ago that will not materialize in hardware)\r\n- replace the CSCCLCTPreTriggerBXCollection by CSCCLCTPreTriggerDigiCollection (in trigger and packer)\r\n\r\nBy the end of the clean-up, the size of `CSCCathodeLCTProcessor.cc` by at least 1500 lines.\r\n\r\nThere should be no changes with respect to the baseline.\r\n\r\nAttention: @ptcox @tahuang1991 @lpernie ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 10, "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1533185512", "deletions": 1701, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "l1-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-started"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_3_X", "number": 24171, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Remove obsolete code and configurations in CSC local trigger", "updated_at": "1533185993", "user": "dildick"}

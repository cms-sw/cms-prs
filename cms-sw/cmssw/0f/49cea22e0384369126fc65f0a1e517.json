These obsolete functions and associated configurations should not have to be maintained in the future. They also make it hard to navigate a file with with >3000 lines. It is better to remove them. I am also removing a few obsolete test files.\r\n\r\nIn future PRs I would like to \r\n- remove an outdated local CSC DQM module\r\n- remove the parameters `isTMB07` and `isMTCC`\r\n- undo the decoupling of CLCTs and LCTs in ME1a and ME1b in upgrade scenarios (an interesting idea ~7 year ago that will not materialize in hardware)\r\n- replace the CSCCLCTPreTriggerBXCollection by CSCCLCTPreTriggerDigiCollection (in trigger and packer)\r\n\r\nBy the end of the clean-up, the size of `CSCCathodeLCTProcessor.cc` will be reduced by at least 1500 lines.\r\n\r\nThere should be no changes with respect to the baseline for this PR.\r\n\r\nAttention: @ptcox @tahuang1991 @lpernie ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 10, "closed_at": "1533278054", "comments": 14, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1533185512", "deletions": 1701, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "65330c0854d272fc39915ceaab37dfc6b88ee7d1", "merged_at": "1533278054", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_3_X", "number": 24171, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Remove obsolete code and configurations in CSC local trigger", "updated_at": "1533302258", "user": "dildick"}

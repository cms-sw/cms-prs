These obsolete functions and associated configurations should not have to be maintained in the future. They also make it hard to navigate a file with with >3000 lines. It is better to remove them. I am also removing a few obsolete test files.\r\n\r\nIn future PRs I would like to remove among others the parameters `isTMB07` and `isMTCC`. By the end of the clean-up, the size of `CSCCathodeLCTProcessor.cc` by at least 1500 lines.\r\n\r\nThere should be no changes with respect to the baseline.\r\n\r\nAttention: @ptcox @tahuang1991 @lpernie ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 10, "comments": 0, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1533185512", "deletions": 1701, "labels": [], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_3_X", "number": 24171, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Remove obsolete code and configurations in CSC local trigger", "updated_at": "1533185637", "user": "dildick"}

It reads the pixel digis to fully reconstruct the raw detector hits and convert it into the format of RD53 chip output readings.\r\nRelevant studies were presented in several DPG meetings in the past (picked one [1]) and also has been documented for last year's EDR review [2]. Recently also has been shown in tracker backend systems (BES) meetings as well [3]\r\n\r\n[1] https://indico.cern.ch/event/1304700/contributions/5492757/attachments/2682398/4653346/20230711_dps_trackerweek_itsimulation.pdf\r\n[2] https://indico.cern.ch/event/1323095/contributions/5567145/attachments/2735303/4756343/ITDataRate_v3.pdf\r\n[3] https://indico.cern.ch/event/1394715/contributions/5863117/attachments/2828164/4941229/trackerbesofflinesw_20240307_dataformat_handling_in_innertracker.pdf\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nResults from this PR have been tested against old standalone workflow in C++ (without any CMSSW dependencies) that were used to get the results in [1] and [2] with the workflow defined in `EventFilter/Phase2TrackerRawToDigi/test/Phase2ITDigiToRaw_cfg.py`.\r\n\r\n@zdemirag @tomalin @sroychow ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 473, "comments": 51, "commits": 217, "created_at": "1724220534", "deletions": 5524, "labels": ["daq-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "pending-signatures", "tests-rejected", "orp-pending", "new-package-pending", "upgrade-approved", "code-checks-approved", "trk", "changes-dataformats"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_0_X", "number": 45759, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 11, "state": "open", "title": "quarter core processor for HL-LHC inner tracker developments", "updated_at": "1733977025", "user": "sihyunjeon"}

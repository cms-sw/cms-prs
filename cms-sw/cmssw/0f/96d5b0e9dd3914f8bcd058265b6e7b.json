The `end()` iterator is dereferenced in there, which gives garbage results.\r\n\r\n Rather than trying to fix this, I suggest to just remove the problematic code. It is unused and probably not important, otherwise the bug would have been found before. Do you agree with this procedure?\r\n\r\nI hope I understood this correctly that there is a bug, otherwise please correct me.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCMSSW compiles and matrix tests pass.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nNo backport intended.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 8, "closed_at": "1593066751", "comments": 17, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1591521411", "deletions": 122, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "0be0752dd7a95cc4976c92796b644dac48a93a8d", "merged_at": "1593066751", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 30133, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Remove invalid usage of TrajectorySeed::recHits()", "updated_at": "1593066751", "user": "guitargeek"}

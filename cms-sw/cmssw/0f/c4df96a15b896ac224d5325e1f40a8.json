There is an overwhelming large amount of fake tracks that need to be accounted for. As is, it attempts to allocate memory for millions of (mostly fake) T5's. We expect the true amount to be around 300,000, compared to the 60,000 in the ttbar sample.\r\n\r\nWe could implement a cut that would remove many of the fake tracks, but there is a chance that this impacts the efficiency. Instead, here I included a condition that performs the standard set of cuts in the counting kernel if the corresponding triplet is densely connected. Most triplets will only be connected to a handful of potential quintuplets, whereas the ones leading to a large amount of fake tracks will have O(1000) connections. So, I included a condition that checks if the number of inner and outer connections is less than 1000.\r\n\r\nNormally the full set of cuts would only be performed in the creation kernel. The cuts that are now included in the counting kernel do not affect the timing for a ttbar sample as none of its events meet the densely connected condition.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1760459211", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "heterogeneous-pending", "tracking"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_0_X", "number": 49164, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "LST: Introducing a condition before checking cuts in the T5 counting kernel", "updated_at": "1760536297", "user": "kk428"}

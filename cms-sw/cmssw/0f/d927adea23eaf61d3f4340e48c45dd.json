So no changes are expected.  \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe PR has been tested within a private deployment of the DT Online-DQM.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 8, "closed_at": "1557426804", "comments": 11, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1557139432", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "b91bd5783c103e37f4c914a0aaf6d39ff839d718", "merged_at": "1557426804", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 26651, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Updating DT Online-DQM to work with slice test data", "updated_at": "1557426805", "user": "battibass"}

This was not done outside the framework.  Replaced were boost::bind, boost::cref, boost::ref, boost::function, and boost::mem_fn.  A few uses where the change turned out not to be trivial were left alone for now.  Most uses of boost;;shared_ptr had already been replaced by std::shared_ptr, but I found a few more uses that were easy to replace.\nThe only changes outside the framework were the necessary addition of missing includes, almost all of boost/bind.hpp, that were exposed when includes of boost headers were removed from framework headers.\nNo interfaces used outside the framework are affected by this pull request.\nThis pull request was tested with the FULL relval matrix, and no errors were introduced by this pull request.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_2_X", "changed_files": 53, "closed_at": "1404902226", "comments": 13, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1404737891", "deletions": 239, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-available", "core-approved", "dqm-pending", "generators-approved", "hlt-approved", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved", "visualization-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "05ece4767af4a38784e0ac3cd9d86a5d441655dc", "merged_at": "1404902226", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_2_X", "number": 4546, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Replace boost:: with std:: where feasible in framework", "updated_at": "1404919891", "user": "wmtan"}

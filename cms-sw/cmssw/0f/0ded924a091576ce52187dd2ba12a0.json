CKF).\r\n\r\nFor timing of (pixel) tracking, i.e., summing all (pixel) tracking modules from usual circles, from single-thread measurements - using CPU-only, for completeness:\r\n- Current baseline = X (X~2.7 s)\r\n- Previous baseline = ~1.075X\r\n- Single iteration (CA extension+LST seeds) with mkFit (future baseline) = ~0.99X (fastest option also for CPU-only)\r\n- Single iteration (CA extension+LST seeds) with CKF = ~1.09X\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1763036056", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["hlt-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "requires-external", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_0_X", "number": 49383, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Update mkFit-related processModifier for LST-seeded phase-2 HLT single tracking iteration", "updated_at": "1763036608", "user": "mmasciov"}

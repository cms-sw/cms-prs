RectangularEtaPhiTrackingRegion is constructed per event by various factory-like classes (+ a couple of others). Therefore the responsibility to call consumes+getByToken is moved to these constructing classes, and they call getByToken only if MTE usage is not disabled (`!= kNever`).\n\nI also changed the default value of `whereToUseMeasurementTracker` from `kForSiStrips` to `kNever` in the constructor of RectangularEtaPhiTrackingRegion. I think this is the only sensible default value given the (also old)  default value of `measurementTracker` parameter.\n\nBased on top of CMSSW_7_1_X_2014-03-27-0200, should not affect physics.\n\nFYI @VinInn @fwyzard @gennai @mtosi @cerati @rovere\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "changed_files": 13, "closed_at": "1396353199", "comments": 9, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1396250811", "deletions": 76, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "hlt-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "0e60bcec6c76668fee9e9b6d7428fb099fc8c93b", "merged_at": "1396353199", "merged_by": "nclopezo", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_1_0_pre6", "number": 3105, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Migrate RectangularEtaPhiTrackingRegion to consumes", "updated_at": "1476951394", "user": "makortel"}

It created the problem in IB because #30365 uses GEMeMap::maxEtaPartition_, which is deleted by #30080. And then, #30440 reverts #30365.\r\nTo solve it, this PR reverts #30440 and then removes the usage of GEMeMap::etaPartition.\r\n\r\nThe following describes the added files.\r\n- GEMOfflineMonitor checks the attributes of GEM-related objects like digi and rechit excluding what online DQM do. Segment part is planned to be updated after GEM/ME0 merging.\r\n- GEMEfficiencyAnalyzer and GEMEfficiiencyHarvester measure GEM efficiency and resolution using both tight global muons and standalone muons.\r\n\r\n@jshlee @watson-ij @szaleski\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 13, "closed_at": "1593842050", "comments": 27, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1593518155", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "f872e1de7030d8a80b1943b91ceba38c25faa554", "merged_at": "1593842049", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 30468, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Re-add modules for GEM offline DQM", "updated_at": "1593842050", "user": "seungjin-yang"}

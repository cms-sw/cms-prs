I noticed that in recent cosmic data these plots are almost all empty (see e.g.https://tinyurl.com/2q9tgomk). This was caused by a bug in the filling of the `MonitorElements` which is fixed in this PR.\r\nI profit of it to:\r\n   * modernize the code of the module\r\n   * introduce a `fillDescriptions` method and use it in the related configurations\r\n   * remove the `TrackSplitMonitor` from the Tracking DQM collisions setup as anyway there are no right input tracks to be fed to the module.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRun successfully `runTheMatrix.py -l 138.1 -t 4 -j 8 --custom_command='-n 5000' --ibeos` and checked that the cosmic plots are all filled.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

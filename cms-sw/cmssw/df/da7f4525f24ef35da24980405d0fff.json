Also, std::make_unique is used when appropriate. Also, there was a case where a reference to an auto_ptr was an input argument to a function, which is a bad practice because it obscures the possible transfer of ownership. In the cases here, ownership was not transferred, so the object itself was passed by reference.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 37, "closed_at": "1473308372", "comments": 12, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1472964361", "deletions": 128, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "790e831f308878d6a915d00ce2e72f065c13d88b", "merged_at": "1473308372", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 15720, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Use unique_ptr, not auto_ptr in RecoLocalCalo", "updated_at": "1473367208", "user": "wmtan"}

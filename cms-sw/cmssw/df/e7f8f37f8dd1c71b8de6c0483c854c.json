The reason for this is that in the Muon unpacker and uGMT emulator the step size for unconstrained pT was 0.5 GeV (as it is for standard pT), however in firmware it is actually 1 GeV. This PR fixes the discrepancy in both the unpacker and emulator.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\nbp of #32906\r\nWe would like this fix in for the next MWGR.\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1613646066", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1613382056", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved", "urgent"], "merge_commit_sha": "2de523e958c22bf2af55657bd22562f6080024b0", "merged_at": "1613646066", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 32913, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "(Backport for 11_2_X) Correct muon unconstrained pT scale", "updated_at": "1613646067", "user": "dinyar"}

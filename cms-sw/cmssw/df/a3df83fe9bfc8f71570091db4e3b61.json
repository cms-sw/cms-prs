In this PR, we remove the postLS1_HI customization and switch the HLT menu from HIon (which relied on the PostLS1_HI customization) to the fake HLT menu in workflow 140.0. In my tests, this PR solves the crash.\n\nCheers,\nKrisztian\n\n[1] An exception of category 'CorrelatedNoisifier' occurred while\n   [0] Processing run: 1 lumi: 36 event: 36\n   [1] Running path 'digitisation_step'\n   [2] Calling event method for module CSCDigiProducer/'simMuonCSCDigis'\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1434428238", "comments": 10, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1433667736", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "pdmv-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "2fe822417a2914176f7914734c15b5d9b529d611", "merged_at": "1434428238", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 9487, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix for crash in 140.0: remove PostLS1_HI customization from legacy HI workflow", "updated_at": "1434428238", "user": "kkrajczar"}

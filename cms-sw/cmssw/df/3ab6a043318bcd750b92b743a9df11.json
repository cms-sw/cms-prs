However, #27886 requires that there be only one `DDSolidShape`, and it is used by both old and new DD. This PR comments out the new `DDSolidShape`. After the DD4hep migration is finished, the old `DDSolidShape` can be eliminated and replaced with the new one.\r\n\r\nPlease merge this PR promptly because it is needed by #27886.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe changes in this PR are compile-time only. Compilation was successful.\r\n\r\nNo backport.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1568193993", "comments": 18, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1567622873", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "geometry-rejected", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "requires-external", "tests-approved", "urgent"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27933, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "Remove second DDSolidShape until migration is over", "updated_at": "1568193993", "user": "cvuosalo"}

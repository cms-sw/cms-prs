If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nI suppose this needs to be backported to 15_0_X and 10_6_X, but any other releases in between?", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 5, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1743189606", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved", "xpog-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 47729, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Reduce memory usage in NANO merge jobs", "updated_at": "1743189907", "user": "hqucms"}

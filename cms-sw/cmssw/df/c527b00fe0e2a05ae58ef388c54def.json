I think we are ready to try a relval run on this branch.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_XROOTD_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1398681523", "comments": 1, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1398605664", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "core-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "b758c665c2dff9f8f0c6bffcecea9bfca674ba83", "merged_at": "1398681523", "merged_by": "degano", "number": 3538, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Multisource bugfixes", "updated_at": "1398681523", "user": "bbockelm"}

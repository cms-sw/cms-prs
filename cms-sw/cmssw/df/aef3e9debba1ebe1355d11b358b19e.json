The condition format has been designed:\r\n   * allowing full granularity (i.e. possibility to specify each single threshold for each single degree of freedom)\r\n   * allowing flexibility in the list of alignable detectors (might want to add / remove structures in future)\r\n   * keeping in mind possible extensions to more than the current 6 spatial degrees of freedom that are aligned (sensor surfaces, pixel/strip calibration parameters, etc. etc.)\r\n\r\nFor a full presentation about the concept see [this presentation](https://indico.cern.ch/event/616398/contributions/2510155/attachments/1430402/2196956/mm_AlCa_20Mar2017.pdf)\r\nOnce this is merged a second PR will follow, including changes in the consumer code in the `Alignment` package.\r\n\r\nAttention: @ghellwig, @mschrode, @meng-xiao \r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 26, "closed_at": "1490881219", "comments": 46, "commits": 8, "created_at": "1490595502", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["alca-approved", "comparison-available", "db-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "504c5ff6007cd41da9062393d9e9a25daa0d3b8c", "merged_at": "1490881219", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_1_X", "number": 18087, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 22, "state": "closed", "title": "[91X] SiPixelAli PCL payload creation thresholds from db - CondFormats", "updated_at": "1490938046", "user": "mmusich"}

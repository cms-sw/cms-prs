This has been observed to occupy resources on the build servers.  This PR calls `TProof::Close(\"S\")`, which should tell the workers to shutdown rather than detach.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRan the standard tests and observed that no worker processes were left behind.  This PR should have no impact on anything outside the scope of the TFWLiteSelector unit tests.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1572425074", "comments": 12, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1572364546", "deletions": 20, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "aa55527132b0fc50f0150e07ee0bb923624e4b9b", "merged_at": "1572425073", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 28305, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "call close with the option to shutdown workers", "updated_at": "1572425074", "user": "dan131riley"}

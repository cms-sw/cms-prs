Since both of these functions take iterators, they are not modifying the length of the original sequence (`std::vector`) - i.e. the removed elements are still accessible but their value is undefined. One must call `erase(...)` to update the number of elements.\r\n\r\nThe proposed changes cleanup most of the reported issues. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nBot tests", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 11, "comments": 10, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1739287437", "deletions": 12, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "hlt-pending", "reconstruction-approved", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "xpog-pending", "tracking", "trk"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 47320, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Fix improper use of std::unique and std::remove", "updated_at": "1739466815", "user": "iarspider"}

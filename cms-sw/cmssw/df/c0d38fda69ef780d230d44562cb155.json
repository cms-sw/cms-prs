This happened because the `DFS`\r\ntraversal and `SimCluster` population occurred without checking the\r\nselector status of the current `CaloParticle`. As a result, `SimClusters`\r\nbelonging to rejected `CaloParticles` were still saved. This fix ensures\r\nthat `SimClusters` are only saved if their corresponding `CaloParticle` has\r\npassed the selection.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nChecked on some `runTheMatrix` workflows and there are no more orphan `SimClusters`.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1745255493", "comments": 12, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1744800487", "deletions": 70, "labels": ["simulation-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "upgrade-approved", "code-checks-approved", "ngt"], "merge_commit_sha": "cd48fe0c707c28c5a4323d92873e3fdf96fecddd", "merged_at": "1745255493", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 47883, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix orphan sim clusters", "updated_at": "1745255495", "user": "rovere"}

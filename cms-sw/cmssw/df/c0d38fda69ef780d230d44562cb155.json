This happened because the `DFS`\r\ntraversal and `SimCluster` population occurred without checking the\r\nselector status of the current `CaloParticle`. As a result, `SimClusters`\r\nbelonging to rejected `CaloParticles` were still saved. This fix ensures\r\nthat `SimClusters` are only saved if their corresponding `CaloParticle` has\r\npassed the selection.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nChecked on some `runTheMatrix` workflows and there are no more orphan `SimClusters`.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "comments": 5, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1744800487", "deletions": 70, "labels": ["simulation-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-approved", "ngt"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 47883, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Fix orphan sim clusters", "updated_at": "1744800816", "user": "rovere"}

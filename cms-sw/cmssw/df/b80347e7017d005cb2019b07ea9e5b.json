This never caused problems before as this is only done on file open and we didn't have many concurrent file opens.\n\nFixes (I hope) issue #13081.\n\nAs a bonus, I did a small commit that handles memory management for the `response` parameter to the `HandleResponse` virtual function in the same manner as the upstream `XrdCl`.  That is, I delete for callbacks where they delete; I leave `response` untouched for operations where they leave it untouched.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1454237302", "comments": 27, "commits": 8, "created_at": "1453860985", "deletions": 23, "labels": ["comparison-available", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "tests-rejected"], "merge_commit_sha": "ec50f4717ee4186d6138a30938b66ac6955d912d", "merged_at": "1454237302", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 13085, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 8, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix Xrootd thread-safety issue in quality metric factory", "updated_at": "1454237302", "user": "bbockelm"}

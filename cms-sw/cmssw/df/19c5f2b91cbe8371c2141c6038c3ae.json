The request is summarised in the following JIRA ticket: https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSLITDPG-329\r\n\r\nThe relevant DQM plots are produced by the code in the following 10_2_X PR: #23686 (10_1_X backport: #23695). The latter code requires the changes in the L1T unpackers made in the following 10_2_X PR: #23257 (10_1_X backport: #23628).

In particular, it adds interface changes to streamTransitionAsync.h that were recently made in globalTransitionAsync.h so the two will remain similar. It also changes other interfaces from EventProcessor down the stack to the Worker classes and into the ProductResolvers.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRan existing unit tests. This should not change any behavior or any results. It just makes the code easier to read and understand.\r\n\r\n(This is the third try at this. I incorporated the changes we discussed this morning on zoom. In particular, you might want to look at ProductResolvers.cc. Also, I renamed one of the setupOnDemandSystem in WorkerManager. The rest is almost identical to the previous version of the PRs. I removed the percolation code in prefetchAsync_ and that simplified things. I also rebased and squashed the whole thing into one commit.)\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 35, "closed_at": "1600841232", "comments": 32, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1599853046", "deletions": 752, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "5bc7656ab0f3e9ae375dcff09c4850569731c6b4", "merged_at": "1600841232", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 31442, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 10, "state": "closed", "title": "Use TransitionInfo in more interfaces 3", "updated_at": "1600841233", "user": "wddgit"}

This causes a significant drop in efficiency of ETL reconstructed hits for instance in scenario D76, due incorrect digitization, as mentioned in #33130 . \r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the issue by defining new Eras with the proper addition of the requested modifier, and updating the corresponding test workflows accordingly.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTest wf. 34634.0 now shows back a reasonable hit efficiency in ETL on 10 TTbar events.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1615910968", "comments": 28, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1615396212", "deletions": 15, "labels": ["bug-fix", "code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "operations-approved", "orp-approved", "pdmv-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved", "urgent"], "merge_commit_sha": "07a27e5287a583bb5fd83e34f568a4f206536bec", "merged_at": "1615910968", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 33139, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Update new Phase2C11xx eras by adding the etlV4 modifier", "updated_at": "1615910969", "user": "fabiocos"}

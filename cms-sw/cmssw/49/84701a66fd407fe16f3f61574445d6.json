Four of the loops are not vectorized by any of our compilers, so I commented out the simd pragma for those. For the others that are vectorized by icc and gcc, I added an ifdef to disable the simd pragma for clang. I would have preferred to suppress the warning messages with a compiler pragma, but that doesn't seem to be possible for the case where vectorization is supposed to be forced.  Resolves #41624.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCompiles without warnings with clang16 and gcc.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 4, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1684416625", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "tracking"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_2_X", "number": 41730, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "remove MkFit clang16 vectorization warnings ", "updated_at": "1684438508", "user": "dan131riley"}

Due to the dependency on \"BTauGenericMVAJetTagComputerRcd\" and \"JetTagComputerRecord\", the corresponding b-tagging computers need to be masked in run3. As DNN taggers will be the only supported ones in run3, this PR masks the old taggers with Era modifier except for DeepCSV and particleNet.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nPR tested in local with runTheMatrix.py processes. However, the standard run 2 validation sequences will fail due to missing b-tagger objects.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with any link to the master PR, or the intended backport release cycle numbers -->\r\nThis PR is for run 3. Not a backport and no backport planed.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 25, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1666333154", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "alca-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "requires-external", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_6_X", "number": 39808, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Mask old b-taggers and keep only DNN taggers with Era modifier for run3.", "updated_at": "1668715404", "user": "yuanchao"}

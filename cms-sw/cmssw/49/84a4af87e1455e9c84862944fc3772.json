Previously they were being initialized up to N_proc, which may be smaller than the full vector width NN.  This PR ensures that any MPlex entries past N_proc are initialized to zero, since many of the propagation loops go up to NN to aid vectorization.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nReran valgrind and verified that there were no MkFit warnings.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1668847117", "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1668705442", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "3f2a3853611f634c60a5b8eb49a946d98d808aeb", "merged_at": "1668847117", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_6_X", "number": 40105, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "fix initialization of local variables to avoid vagrind warnings", "updated_at": "1668847117", "user": "dan131riley"}

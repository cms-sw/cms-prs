Previously they were being initialized up to N_proc, which may be smaller than the full vector width NN.  This PR ensures that any MPlex entries past N_proc are initialized to zero, since many of the propagation loops go up to NN to aid vectorization.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nReran valgrind and verified that there were no MkFit warnings.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 4, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1668705442", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_6_X", "number": 40105, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "fix initialization of local variables to avoid vagrind warnings", "updated_at": "1668795972", "user": "dan131riley"}

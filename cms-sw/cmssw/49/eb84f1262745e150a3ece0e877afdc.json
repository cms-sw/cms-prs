These operations also cause occasional crashes on aarch64 that are not understood.  This PR uses (ugly) `#ifdef EDM_ML_DEBUG` to elide the stringstream operations unless LogDebug is enabled.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nIt compiles.  This is a small technical change that should not result in any physics changes.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1614952931", "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1614877141", "deletions": 12, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "0da98e9725a09e88528705245a110ea108157281", "merged_at": "1614952931", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 33071, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "#ifdef debug stringstream operations in SimMuon/RPCDigitizer", "updated_at": "1614952932", "user": "dan131riley"}

Previously for run 3 the HoE dumped was calo based while for run 2 it was Tower based. Both are needed in both cases for H(gg) analyses.\r\n\r\nPR validation:\r\n\r\nTo test I've created a nAOD starting from Run2 data samples and checked that both version of HoE are dumped correctly\r\n\r\n@lfinco @fcouderc\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1713127445", "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1712931994", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved", "xpog-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "c1c891642d06f0e40162233fbd868f92a9d3632a", "merged_at": "1713127445", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 44728, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "adding HoE Tower based for photons", "updated_at": "1713127446", "user": "TizianoBevilacqua"}

A now-unnecessary special workflow is also removed (the \"Timing\" option, since all supported workflows now include MTD + use of timing in reco).\r\n\r\nThe number of places to edit in order to add new workflows is reduced by automating the deepcopy for PU workflows and the initialization of default datasets.\r\n\r\nTwo new workflows are added to keep alive the T15 tracker and the HF nose, since the previous workflows with those subdetectors used now-unsupported versions of other subdetectors.\r\n\r\nWorkflow numbers are reset and the short matrix is updated accordingly. (This will cause spurious comparison differences.)\r\n\r\nThe 2023 -> 2026 renaming will come in a subsequent PR, because this one is already huge and that one will also be huge.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested that runTheMatrix works correctly.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 58, "closed_at": "1562770356", "comments": 44, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1562339123", "deletions": 3347, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "operations-approved", "orp-approved", "pdmv-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "73157aebaf51106f9e3e07b1731934911f81bfe8", "merged_at": "1562770356", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27449, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 4, "state": "closed", "title": "Clean up Phase2 workflows", "updated_at": "1562770357", "user": "kpedro88"}

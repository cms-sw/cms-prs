While this is very similar to fixedGridRhoFastJetAll (its done on PF candidates before e/gamma feeds back its energy corrected electrons) it would be nice to have it in the miniAOD as we can use it to exactly reproduce the original application of the regression. Its already in AOD, this corrects the oversight that it is not in MINIAOD\r\n\r\nIts a single double added to the event and there are already several fixedGridRhoFastjet flavours so it shouldnt have any impact,.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1555254204", "comments": 20, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1554887648", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved", "xpog-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "4591ed235250b2adbfb99beb91888c994274aaf4", "merged_at": "1555254204", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 26420, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "adding fixedGridRhoFastjetAllTmp to MiniAOD event content", "updated_at": "1556788636", "user": "Sam-Harper"}

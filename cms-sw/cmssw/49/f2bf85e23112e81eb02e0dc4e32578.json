This geometry is integrated in MTD I17 and CMS D104.\r\nThe details about the motivation and implementation can be found in these presentations:\r\n- [MTD DPG (10/11)](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1344170/#38-etl-geometry-update)\r\n- [MTD DPG (13/10)](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1334483/#35-status-of-etl-geometry-and)\r\n- [MTD DPG (09/06)](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1293576/#29-etl-geometry-update-of-sens)\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nFor validation, a TTbar 14TeV has been run with the nominal code in D98 geometry, and the new code in D98 and D104 geometries. We observe (see attached plot):\r\n1. Older geometries remain untouched.\r\n2. The size of the ETL sensor is halved as expected.\r\n3. The number of events recorded is about 10% higher, as the logical area of the pixels has been increased.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/assets/68101581/50b7ce08-ec56-47b3-a081-e93e84bae3db)\r\n\r\n@parbol @fabiocos ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 37, "comments": 27, "commits": 22, "created_at": "1701102589", "deletions": 39, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "geometry-pending", "operations-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "number": 43407, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "open", "title": "ETL Geometry V8", "updated_at": "1701790262", "user": "24LopezR"}

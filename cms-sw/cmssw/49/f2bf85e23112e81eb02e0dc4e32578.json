This geometry is integrated in MTD I17 and CMS D105.\r\nThe details about the motivation and implementation can be found in these presentations:\r\n- [MTD DPG (10/11)](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1344170/#38-etl-geometry-update)\r\n- [MTD DPG (13/10)](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1334483/#35-status-of-etl-geometry-and)\r\n- [MTD DPG (09/06)](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1293576/#29-etl-geometry-update-of-sens)\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nFor validation, a TTbar 14TeV has been run with the nominal code in D98 geometry, and the new code in D98 and D105 geometries. We observe (see attached plot (plot legend says D104 but ultimately D104->D105)):\r\n1. Older geometries remain untouched.\r\n2. The size of the ETL sensor is halved as expected.\r\n3. The number of events recorded is about 10% higher, as the logical area of the pixels has been increased.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/assets/68101581/50b7ce08-ec56-47b3-a081-e93e84bae3db)\r\n\r\nAdded runTheMatrix test workflow 27634.0 for this scenario 2026D105.\r\n\r\n@parbol @fabiocos ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 30, "comments": 56, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1701102589", "deletions": 39, "labels": ["operations-pending", "geometry-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "pdmv-approved", "upgrade-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "number": 43407, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 7, "state": "open", "title": "ETL Geometry V8", "updated_at": "1702281143", "user": "24LopezR"}

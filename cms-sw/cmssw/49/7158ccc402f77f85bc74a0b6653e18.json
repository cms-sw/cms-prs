This swaps a lot of Calo Layer 1 Infrastructure pointers over to std::shared_ptr's to try and avoid memory leak issues. Summary card regions are now stored as the objects themselves, instead of pointers to them (That decision may not be directly necessary? It makes sense to me, and there is a spot where pointers to these things are used internally, and nullptrs are possible but checked against)\r\n> \r\n> This is just a first pass, but a larger fix of all of this infrastructure with smart pointers should be considered.\r\n\r\n@mmusich @mandrenguyen FYI\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nAll code compiles and has had code formatting applied.

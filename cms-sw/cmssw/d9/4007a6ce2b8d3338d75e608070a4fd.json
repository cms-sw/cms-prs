Inspection of code revealed the `getEntryForAllBranches()` and `selectCaches()` are using a different `TTreeCache`, causing the data to be read twice. This PR changes the `getEntryForAllBranches()` to use the same `TTreeCache` as the `selectCache()`.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/49070\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

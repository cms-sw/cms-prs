To summarize:\r\n * Electron/photon energy resolution improves.\r\n * Reconstruction:\r\n   * Electron reconstruction efficiency decreases by a few percent at low pT.\r\n   * Photon reconstruction efficiency decreases overall (being studied).\r\n   * Electron/photon mis-reconstruction rate decreases significantly -- so there's an overall gain in terms of reconstruction to mis-reconstruction efficiencies.\r\n\r\nIt'll be good to test with profiling enabled -- we should see some timing gains because of the reduction in mis-reconstructed electrons/photons.\r\n\r\n[1] https://cmsdoxygen.web.cern.ch/cmsdoxygen/CMSSW_12_2_0_pre2/doc/html/d5/de3/classticl_1_1Trackster.html#ab8b9ce1d52b6b6f74dfbbce754079398\r\n\r\n[2] https://indico.cern.ch/event/1095370/contributions/4622717/attachments/2349624/4007590/presentation_test_tracksterIterationFilter_EgammaReco_2021-11-19.pdf\r\n\r\nTagging the egamma validators @archiron and @beaudett.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1637931144", "comments": 12, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1637579833", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "3d72aa6ab47e26b94ff88c5b3ac56f7176d74e0a", "merged_at": "1637931144", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_2_X", "number": 36204, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Trackster iteration filter for HGCAL electrons and photons", "updated_at": "1637931145", "user": "SohamBhattacharya"}

Now that old ECAL algo is restored, the hierarchy levels are the same for old DD and DD4hep anyway.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1604062475", "comments": 26, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1603966551", "deletions": 7, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "6b7cf862a6f5553c361fe9267d8279d1bbf3e8aa", "merged_at": "1604062475", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 31983, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "Mini-PR: Fix Z side in Preshower", "updated_at": "1604062476", "user": "ghugo83"}

After #12581 the `logintpack` has different minimum by absolute value for positive and negative numbers. Here `PackedCandidateTrackValidator` is made aware of the different minima.\n\nTested in 800pre4, tiny changes expected under `Tracking/PackedCandidate` in `diffCov*Status` and `diffCov*UnderOverFlowSign` histograms for elements packed with `logintpack` (in practice should be visible in 1330.0 and 25202.0 workflows).\n\n@rovere @VinInn \n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1453205110", "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1452600452", "deletions": 8, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "d1febd78c16a92cc38741a9704e5f1de91a17350", "merged_at": "1453205110", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 12914, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix PackedCandidateTrackValidator for different minima of positive and negative values of logintpack", "updated_at": "1476957081", "user": "makortel"}

This usually happened when a given `DetId` only contained invalid pixels (0,0) and no other valid pixel. These were anyway discarded later on, leading to the creation of empty `DetSet`s.\r\nNow after https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/37035 will be merged, empty `DetSet`s should never happen and thus the message is transformed into an error.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n`cmssw` compiles\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 13, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1644910634", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "requires-external", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 36968, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "SiPixelClusterizer: No digis to clusterize warning into error", "updated_at": "1646222598", "user": "mmusich"}

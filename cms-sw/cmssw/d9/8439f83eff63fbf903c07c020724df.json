It is done by default if only the first one is available. The type of returned value of vertex shift is changed to ROOT XYZTVector instead of HepMC::FourVector. This way it will be easy to get rid of HepMC in future. The function name is changed from newVertex to vertexShift, the code inside it is exactly the same. \r\n\r\nSome cleanup of design and code is also performed.\r\n\r\nThe code of one generator \"BeamDivergenceVtxGenerator\" is not changed for the moment. To be checked that it is still needed.\r\n\r\nThe code is validated by checking the coordinates of primary vertex in the interface to G4.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 14, "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1733502650", "deletions": 114, "labels": ["simulation-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_0_X", "number": 46891, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Change Vtx generators to allow HepMC3Product smearing", "updated_at": "1733502677", "user": "mkirsano"}

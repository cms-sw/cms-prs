This will affect anyone who uses the function TTTrack::POCA().\r\n\r\nHowever, people using other TTTrack functions, such as those giving access to the helix parameters, will be unaffected.\r\n\r\nI'd suggest back-porting this fix to CMSSW 11.1, if possible, as although I suspect few people use TTTrack::POCA(), the bug will confuse anyone who does.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1594706612", "comments": 15, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1594650108", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "l1-pending", "orp-approved", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "a2eba1ae462a030b6a55d92a6da13bb7ca5c0ba4", "merged_at": "1594706611", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 30663, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "TTTrack bug fix for POCA ", "updated_at": "1594728672", "user": "tomalin"}

This _should_ be temporary until the full kBMTF/GMT muon objects are available with all fixes.\r\n\r\n@cbotta, @artlbv, just FYI that this PR has been opened. With your approval I will tag Soham on this PR as well.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nNew FEVTDEBUG has the required objects.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nWe are sort of hoping for this content to make it into the scheduled HLT MC production for CMSSW_14_0. Therefore, this PR may need to be backported based on whether or not it can be quickly included in the final build of CMSSW_14_0.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 10, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1707140862", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["l1-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "number": 43869, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Add low pt muon fix objects into phase 2 L1 event content.", "updated_at": "1707210844", "user": "aloeliger"}

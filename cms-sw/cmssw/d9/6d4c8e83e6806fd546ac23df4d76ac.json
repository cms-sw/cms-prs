The problem was that TypeWithDict::dataMemberByName(name) would find only direct data members of a class.\nThis function was enhanced to also find indirect data members.\nAlso, I noticed that the default ctor of MemberWithDict() did not explicitly initialize its data member, a pointer.  So this request also explicitly initializes the pointer.\n\nPlease merge as soon as convenient.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_ROOT6_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1417505803", "comments": 3, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1417463622", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "1215ab67d8e6ff1e9c9d05cb89e1066fd4f26494", "merged_at": "1417505803", "merged_by": "davidlt", "number": 6730, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Find indirect data members", "updated_at": "1417625435", "user": "wmtan"}

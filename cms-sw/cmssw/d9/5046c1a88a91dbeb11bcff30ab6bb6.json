To avoid any confusion, we are standardizing these values to match those used by Geant4.

Going forward, all new Run 3 and Phase 2 scenarios should use this new version.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTest DB payloads were created with the new materials file and compared with existing DB payloads to check for errors.\r\n\r\nWorkflow 11634.0_TTbar_14TeV+TTbar_14TeV_TuneCP5_2021 was run using XML geometry with and without this PR.

The special low l1 threshold is not needed any more with the exchange of the l1 layer.\r\nIt will affect cluster charge distributions for  layer 1. The low edge will shift from 2000 to 4000e.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRun RECO starting from raw data for the cosmic 344420 run.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nNo backport needed.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with any link to  -->\r\n\r\nBefore submitting your pull requests, make sure you followed this checklist:\r\n- verify that the PR is really intended for the chosen branch\r\n- verify that changes follow [CMS Naming, Coding, And Style Rules](http://cms-sw.github.io/cms_coding_rules.html)\r\n- verify that the PR passes the basic test procedure suggested in the [CMSSW PR instructions](https://cms-sw.github.io/PRWorkflow.html)\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 409, "comments": 0, "commits": 98, "created_at": "1633089769", "deletions": 4531, "labels": [], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "number": 35503, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Pix clu thr l1 change", "updated_at": "1633089810", "user": "dkotlins"}

A basic plot is shown below.\r\n - The red histogram is after the eta cut while the blue histogram is before cut. An |eta|<2.15 has been applied as can be observed by comparing the plots. \r\n - Code checks and code format performed\r\n - Based on advice from @Martin-Grunewald on a similar PR at https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/39764, it was decided to change the `HLTEgammaEtFilter` class in place of adding a new class. \r\n\r\n#### PR backport:\r\n\r\n - PR needs to be backported to CMSSW_12_4_X and 12_5_X.\r\n - Original PR: https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/39789\r\n - Also backport of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/39792 in 125X\r\n - The current software at HLT is in the 12_4_X release. Hence the need for backporting to 12_4_X.\r\n \r\n![Screenshot from 2022-10-19 09-12-41](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32368439/196621814-b7d632e2-7a4e-4cf4-a920-67620937927e.png)", "branch": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1666327636", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1666253993", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["hlt-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "backport-ok"], "merge_commit_sha": "42edbeb1df0ab8b6b02241979479176c018b44ac", "merged_at": "1666327636", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 39791, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add Eta cut to HLT Egamma objects - BackportFrom126X to 124X", "updated_at": "1666327637", "user": "arsahasransu"}

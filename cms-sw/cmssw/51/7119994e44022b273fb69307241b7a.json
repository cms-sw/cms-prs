In pA and AA collisions, the yields of isoMus and Z's are strongly suppressed by the *RelCombIsoMuons step.  Studies on 2013 pPb data show improvement in alignment yields using producers where this step has been removed as outlined in the following presentation at the tracker alignment weekly meeting:\n\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/536888/contributions/2326743/attachments/1348506/2034547/10_5_16_Alignment.pdf\n\nAdditional edits were made to the new Millepede configuration files to include these new track collections in the standard workflows.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 20, "closed_at": "1476025840", "comments": 25, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1475689718", "deletions": 40, "labels": ["alca-pending", "comparison-pending", "dqm-pending", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 16109, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 10, "state": "closed", "title": "PA Common Alignment Producers 81X", "updated_at": "1476025840", "user": "jrcastle"}

Technical performance is not affected either.\r\nThis is validated in: http://uaf-10.t2.ucsd.edu/~mmasciov/MIC/testFastMath/MTV_ttbarPU_cgpu-1_fastmath_vs_ofast/ (red/black vs. blue)\r\n\r\nFYI, @mmusich, @slava77 ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1683210127", "comments": 23, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1681901452", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved", "tracking"], "merge_commit_sha": "34c45385611f7f64bf2ca4f2e826014b8fe70f62", "merged_at": "1683210127", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_13_2_X", "number": 41374, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Use ofast-flag rather than fast-math for mkFit", "updated_at": "1683210128", "user": "mmasciov"}

It was notice on recent multi-thread builds (7_2_X an 7_1_X) that a fraction of the calls to HepPDT::ParticleData return a 0 value for the tau lifetime. This is now configured at the start of the job and avoid the bug by using Tauolapp::Tauola::setTauLifetime( lifetime ); routine. Additional changes to the TauValidation is included. \n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1407324416", "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1406727998", "deletions": 37, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "generators-approved", "orp-pending", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "0e55c97684cee128e4ff73fefbb960217fb7916f", "merged_at": "1407324416", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "number": 4835, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "patch for taulifetime and multi-threading", "updated_at": "1408402114", "user": "inugent"}

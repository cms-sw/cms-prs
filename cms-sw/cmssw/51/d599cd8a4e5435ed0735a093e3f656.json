However, there was no check that the initial value is not already at or beyond the trailer, which would result in loop that moves forward until it reaches an invalid memory address.\r\n\r\nThis condition has been observed online, for example\r\n```\r\nblock (14,0,0) thread (0,0,0)\r\nfind_next_tower_block(current_tower_block = 0x7fa96ba042c8, trailer = 0x7fa96ba042c0, ...)\r\n```\r\nresulting in\r\n```\r\nBegin processing the 951st record.

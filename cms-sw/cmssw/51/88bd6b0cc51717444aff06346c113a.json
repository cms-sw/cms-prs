This PR is needed by TSG for HLT-rate studies in `12_3_X`. It simply adds an option to a producer without changing its defaults.\r\n\r\nDescription of the original PR by @Sam-Harper (cc: @silviodonato @Martin-Grunewald):\r\n>This PR adds an option to disable resetting the prescale counters of the L1 trigger on lumi section change. This is needed for offline L1 reemulations where we only have ~23000 events per lumisection available (often much much less due to multithreading/job splitting) and this reset comes too soon and causes triggers to have a much higher effective prescale or not fire at all. This is based on the excellent debugging and investigations by @sanuvarghese\r\n>\r\n>Also could experts just confirm why the L1 resets counters every lumisection? I'm just curious to why.\r\n>\r\n>Finally as spotted by both Sanu and myself, we note that this code can not work with fractional prescales. What is the plan here?\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRelies on the validation done for the original PR.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\n#37395\r\n\r\nPurpose: HLT development in `12_3_X`.", "branch": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 6, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1649144387", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["l1-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "urgent", "backport-ok"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 37462, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Adding option to disable resetting L1 PS counters on ls change [`12_3_X`]", "updated_at": "1649161139", "user": "missirol"}

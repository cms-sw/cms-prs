For the upcoming 2018 HI run, two min-bias triggers that have different thresholds, but are otherwise identical, have been requested.\r\n\r\nThis PR implements two changes:\r\n\r\n- The code changes needed to generate LUTs for the HCAL trigger that configure the second HF min-bias feature bit. This code has already been used to generate LUTs that have been used online for the HI test runs. \r\n- For the `pp_on_AA_2018` era, the HF trigger primitive simulation has been modified to generate two min-bias feature bits with thresholds of >15 and >19 ADC counts for the existing and new (\"second\") feature bit. These thresholds are similar to those that are expected to be used during the 2018 HI run. No changes are expected for any other era.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 9, "comments": 27, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1539276217", "deletions": 29, "labels": ["alca-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "db-pending", "l1-approved", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_4_X", "number": 24847, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Implement second HF min-bias feature bit", "updated_at": "1539583498", "user": "christopheralanwest"}

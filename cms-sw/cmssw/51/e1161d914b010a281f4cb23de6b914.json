The offline rho was used only temporarily, until the **@hltScouting** DQM sequence was created (with PR #47235), to avoid crash with non-ScoutingPFMonitor datasets.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis PR has been prepared starting from CMSSW_15_1_X_2025-02-10-2300: \r\n`cmsrel CMSSW_15_1_X_2025-02-10-2300`\r\n`cd CMSSW_15_1_X_2025-02-10-2300/src` \r\n`cmsenv `\r\n`git cms-init` \r\n`git cms-addpkg DQMOffline/HLTScouting` \r\n`scram b` \r\n`scram build code-checks` \r\n`scram build code-format`\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

Since the error return provides no guarantee that the read() would succeed, this could lead to the signal handler blocking on the read() indefinitely.  This patch treats any error return similar to a timeout, returning without attempting the read.\r\n\r\nref:\r\nhttps://hypernews.cern.ch/HyperNews/CMS/get/edmFramework/3798/1/1/2.html\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 8, "closed_at": "1509377025", "comments": 28, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1508943806", "deletions": 31, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "899e1ca6554512674f496643c920287d3bf716e5", "merged_at": "1509377025", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_0_X", "number": 21020, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "handle error returns from poll() in InitRootHandlers signal handler", "updated_at": "1509377025", "user": "dan131riley"}

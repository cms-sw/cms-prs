As a result the TrackerSeedValidator got no associations to TPs for TrajectorySeeds. This is fixed here by making the call to `prepareCluster2TPMap()`, as in the methods making the associations for Tracks.\n\nNote: AFAICT 74X is not affected as it seems that the bug got fixed in #3639.\n\nTested in 620_SLHC20 (that the fix does what it should), and in 620_SLHC23_patch2 and wf 10239 that it doesn't affect standard workflows (as TrackerSeedValidator is not part of them).\n\n@rovere @VinInn \n", "branch": "CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1423585590", "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1423473354", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "10c2e264a7bc8ca9d418d5447d76879f23555fbc", "merged_at": "1423585590", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "number": 7626, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix cluster-TP association for TrajectorySeeds in QuickTrackAssociatorByHits", "updated_at": "1476956212", "user": "makortel"}

This does not break anything as currently there is no validation for cosmics in CMSSW.\n- some fixes to muon validation has been added:\n- validation plots of reco quantities only for signal-matched muons (useful to remove contamination from PU to the interesting quantities, and to validate samples produced with premixing)\n- technical improvements (still only a first set, more to come) reducing the cpu footprint of muon validation\n- fix the indentation in MuonTrackValidator (broken since 620 !)\n- minor fixes to log messages\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 12, "closed_at": "1426874854", "comments": 12, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1426074356", "deletions": 738, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "80b8e3f1f05f6a0eb41c06e0a0a2643d533fd99e", "merged_at": "1426874854", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 8199, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Cosmic muon validation", "updated_at": "1426874855", "user": "abbiendi"}

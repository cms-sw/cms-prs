The unit test query takes more than 15s that is why it is now very frequently failing. I have reverted the change in #37208 and updated the unit test script to properly dump the output if  `edmPickEvents.py` fails. \r\n\r\nI also have updated the dataset used for querying das. Now unit test uses the dataset used by workflow `136.8521` . This allows unit test to make use of already cached das results and open already existing data file from ibeos cache", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 9, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1647426593", "deletions": 25, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 37255, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Fix edmPickEvents.py unit test", "updated_at": "1647434028", "user": "smuzaffar"}

In 75X for pp reference run we ended up making edits in the actual release.\r\nGiven that special settings are applicable to both data and MC, it is more appropriate to have them set up using eras.\r\n\r\nBefore deleting customise_PPwithHI, I checked that the resulting config is the same with the customise and with the era on top of the corresponding parent era (Run2_25ns + customisePPrecoForPeripheralPbPb vs Run2_25ns_peripheralPbPb; and Run2_2016+customisePPrecoforPPb vs Run2_2016_pA).\r\n\r\nCurrent status of DataProcessing setup in 81X prevented debugging there:\r\n- https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/15792 is still not resolved \r\n- and a possible alternative pkl solution was not implemented or tested\r\n\r\n@makortel @rovere @VinInn note the edits in the seeding setup PSets instead of specific iterative tk module instances. It seemed that to me that this is more straightforward for maintenance reasons (in addition to plain simplicity reason of having less spots to add the modifications).\r\n\r\nI'll wait for inputs for ~day  before porting this to 81X.\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 15, "closed_at": "1478198473", "comments": 46, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1477880530", "deletions": 247, "labels": ["backport", "comparison-available", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-approved", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "fe258f2d3c1843838d67bd1064b9b8bc6da83b88", "merged_at": "1478198473", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 16394, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "new T0 scenario ppEra_Run2_2016_pA; migration of customise_PPwithHI to eras", "updated_at": "1478198473", "user": "slava77"}

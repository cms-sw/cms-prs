For standardization, it also replaces assert.h by cassert in all framework C++ files except C files and third party files, \n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 16, "closed_at": "1376456513", "comments": 0, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1376446732", "deletions": 9, "labels": [], "merge_commit_sha": "49ff1a8aa6f36e5eb71f645bbe0c6be7d7144950", "merged_at": "1376456513", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_0_0_pre3", "number": 309, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add missing includes of <cassert>", "updated_at": "1406900035", "user": "wmtan"}

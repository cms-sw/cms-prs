This meant relabeling DQM plots such as cscDQMOccupancy among others. Chambers with the label \"N\" became labeled \"N1\", \"N2\" ... depending on which sector they preceded.\r\n\r\nChange implemented in response to https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/39936, in which it was discovered that histogram merging is dependent on bin labels in newer ROOT versions, and therefore cannot be duplicate (https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/25569)\r\n\r\nThe flag gemChamberBXVFAT.CanExtend was also set to false for consistency with other plots.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nFirst, the issue outlined in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/39936 was recreated using the PSet in /afs/cern.ch/user/c/cmst0/public/PausedJobs/HIReplay2022/job_244/job/WMTaskSpace/cmsRun1. Then, the plot labels were changed and new DQMIO files were made with DQMRootOutputModule. These files substituted the input files used in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/39936 and the merge was successful.\r\n\r\nROOT files were also created using DQMFileSaverPB to view the plots and ensure that the labels were correct.\r\n\r\nThis change will also be backported to release CMSSW_12_5_X and 12_5_1_patch1,\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

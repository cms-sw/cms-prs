For that reason I ported it back to a newer version of the algorithm, see also http://amcatnlo.web.cern.ch/amcatnlo/mcatnlo_hwan_MLM.f\nThe same commit is also made in CMSSW 7_1_X\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_2_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1403880323", "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1403864031", "deletions": 67, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "fully-signed", "generators-approved", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "acc767969bcc045bc9d993107628ed979625c5df", "merged_at": "1403880323", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_2_X", "number": 4419, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Update hwmatch.F", "updated_at": "1403880324", "user": "mharrend"}

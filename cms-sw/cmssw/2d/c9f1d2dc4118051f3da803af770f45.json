A sequence of strings is still considered to mean one `InputTag` per string, e.g. `VInputTag([\"one\", \"two\", \"three\"])` has three elements.\r\n\r\n`ESInputTag` can be assigned from a sequence of 0 or 2 strings (to be consistent with the colon-separated-string assignment constraints). `VESInputTag` can be constructed with a sequence of a sequence of 0 or 2 strings.\r\n\r\nResolves #29846\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nUnit test runs.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1591943758", "comments": 58, "commits": 10, "created_at": "1590509927", "deletions": 15, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "dadf77f532f77757f565622852ddf8db97169dc3", "merged_at": "1591943758", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 29992, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 19, "state": "closed", "title": "Allow InputTag and ESInputTag in a PSet to be assigned from a sequence of strings", "updated_at": "1591943758", "user": "makortel"}

With the move to Puppi jets as the default AK4 jet collection in Run 3, this PR ports the DeepJet and ParticleNetAK4 taggers to the `slimmedJetsPuppi` collection. The existing trainings derived for Run 2 CHS jets are directly applied to AK4 Puppi jets, and they show similar performance on Puppi jets and CHS jets [[1](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1155634/contributions/4859816/attachments/2436515/4175943/%5BUpdated%5D%20ParticleNet_Run3_20220503.pdf)].\r\n\r\nSpecifically:\r\n - DeepJet evaluation and storage is added to Puppi jets, but meanwhile it still kept for CHS jets for now per BTV request\r\n - ParticleNetAK4 evaluation and storage is removed for CHS jets and only applied to Puppi jets\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested w/ `runTheMatrix.py -l 136.88811`.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1651735244", "deletions": 54, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "xpog-pending", "btv"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 37814, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Port DeepJet and ParticleNetAK4 taggers to Puppi jets in MiniAOD", "updated_at": "1652174715", "user": "hqucms"}

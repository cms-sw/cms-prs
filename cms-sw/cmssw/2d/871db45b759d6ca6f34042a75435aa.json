NB. Parameters need further tuning [work in progress]\r\n- Introduce the \"Out-In\" step for the Trackster creation. Currently enabled by default for both EM and HAD reconstruction. Compatibility angles between Layer clusters can be tuned separately for the \"In-Out\" and \"Out-In\" steps. \r\n- Use at least 2 cells to form a Layer cluster in the Silicon part [more robust against noise, less combinatorial background]. For the Scintillator part the requirement is relaxed to 1 cell\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nFirst validation of the changes can be found in the following links:\r\n- Aug 12: https://indico.cern.ch/event/838150/contributions/3526956/attachments/1892407/3121242/lg-hgccmg-hgchadreco-20190812.pdf\r\n- Aug 19: https://indico.cern.ch/event/842095/contributions/3534224/attachments/1894454/3125220/lg-hgccmg-hgchadreco-20190819.pdf\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 13, "closed_at": "1568311341", "comments": 83, "commits": 10, "created_at": "1566466442", "deletions": 28, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "7a0e60c20b829f12ee8529a04ee9189cc5ec8e60", "merged_at": "1568311341", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27819, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 16, "state": "closed", "title": "HGCAL: 1st version of hadronic reconstruction ", "updated_at": "1568311341", "user": "gouskos"}

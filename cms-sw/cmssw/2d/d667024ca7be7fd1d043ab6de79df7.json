The old method was using a specific order of attributes which is not necessarily the case in general. The change makes it such that we check the name of the attribute before getting the value. \r\n\r\nThis PR has no effect on normal CMSSW workflows. This method is only used by experts when making new BDT LUTs.   \r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with a description of the feature proposed or problem addressed, specifying:\r\n  - what changes are expected in the output if any, \r\n  - what other PRs or externals it depends upon if any,\r\n  - link to any additional material useful to provide a documentation for this PR (slides, JIRA tickets, related pull requestes, hypernews, TWiki or Indico pages)  -->\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles and runs. Validated with the private code for loading XML files and it works as expected. \r\n\r\nThis is not used in normal emulator behaviour, so it shouldn't affect anything else.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with a description of which tests have been performed to verify the correctness of the PR, including the eventual addition of new code for testing like unit tests, test configurations, additions or updates to the runTheMatrix test workflows -->\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with any link to  -->\r\n\r\nBefore submitting your pull requests, make sure you followed this checklist:\r\n- verify that the PR is really intended for the chosen branch\r\n- verify that changes follow [CMS Naming, Coding, And Style Rules](http://cms-sw.github.io/cms_coding_rules.html)\r\n- verify that the PR passes the basic test procedure suggested in the [CMSSW PR instructions](https://cms-sw.github.io/PRWorkflow.html)\r\n\r\n@jrotter2 \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 0, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1652280818", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["l1-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 37911, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "EMTF emulator update to make BDT tree loading safer", "updated_at": "1652280864", "user": "eyigitba"}

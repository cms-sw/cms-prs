While that works, it adds more pieces to be managed and disconnects the configuration parameters of a module (in addition to slight abuse of EventSetup system as \"a job\" is not a real IOV). This PR proposes to replace such Alpaka ESProducers with the `MoveToDeviceCache` introduced in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/43969.\r\n\r\nResolves https://github.com/cms-sw/framework-team/issues/1129\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles, matrix workflows 12834.{402,412,422} and 145.604 run with and without an NVIDIA GPU.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 48, "comments": 25, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1736204553", "deletions": 827, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "hlt-pending", "alca-pending", "db-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "heterogeneous-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_0_X", "number": 47047, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 7, "state": "open", "title": "Replace configuration-copying Alpaka ESProducers with MoveToDeviceCache", "updated_at": "1736531802", "user": "makortel"}

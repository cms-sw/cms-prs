However the IPs need to be harcoded due to DNS issues (an issue with Java which as far as we are aware is unsolvable).\r\n\r\nOnly the offline DB had its IPs hardcoded, we now add IPs for the online (p5 only) and online mirror (accessable outside p5) so users can also use a proxy for these dbs.\r\n\r\nFinally to have a work around in the future, support for direct tunnels where a user specifically forwards a given port on their machine to a db has been added so we can always fall back on this.\r\n\r\nAim to back port to 12_4, 12_5, 12_6\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 0, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1673258126", "deletions": 14, "labels": ["hlt-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "number": 40454, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Expanding HLT Configuration Proxy Support and Adding Tunnel Support : 13_X", "updated_at": "1673258149", "user": "Sam-Harper"}

Pushed from 10_6_35.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nSame as linked original PR below. Verified using `scram build code-check` and `scram build code-format`. Seem to be a couple of minor indentation changes in lines unrelated to the actual TopRecoilHook in Pythia8Hadronizer.cc as a result of the code-format tool.  All differences between original PR are to account for CMSSW_10_6_35 formatting.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nOriginal PR found [here](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/42180). Backport meant to allow for legacy Run 2 analysis, as this feature causes a shift in some top mass reconstruction variables.\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 19, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1688640167", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["generators-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "hold", "backport-ok"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 42202, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 5, "state": "open", "title": "Backport recoilToTop to CMSSW 10_6_35", "updated_at": "1692879527", "user": "vslokenb"}

Most of the redesign is just reorganization and renaming. Important Triton changes:\r\n1. client-side timeouts now supported\r\n2. https/ssl now supported (not introduced here, support will come in a followup)\r\n3. batch size handling changed: models that support triton-style batching have the specified shape modified so that the first entry is the batch size. The handling of shapes in SonicTriton is modified so that the user does not have to worry about this, and can continue to consider batch size and input shape separately, which is conceptually easier.\r\n\r\nSonicTriton interface changes:\r\n1. `modelVersion = cms.string()` (was `cms.int32()`)\r\n2. `setShape()` accessors to change one dimension or all dimensions (rather than non-const ref `shape()` accessor)\r\n3. unneeded `dims()` accessor removed\r\n4. some other accessors made private (only used by `TritonClient`)\r\n\r\nThe cvmfs server image for tests is updated accordingly (see https://github.com/lgray/triton-torchgeo-gat-example/pull/1).\r\n\r\nThe corresponding external update is https://github.com/cms-sw/cmsdist/pull/6293.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRan examples in `HeterogeneousCore/SonicTriton/test`.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 11, "closed_at": "1602692700", "comments": 27, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1602164682", "deletions": 267, "labels": ["code-checks-rejected", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "heterogeneous-approved", "orp-approved", "requires-external", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "b95457face9aedb988ebb8123bed0491f018eb1e", "merged_at": "1602692700", "merged_by": "silviodonato", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 31715, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "Update SonicTriton client to Triton version 2.3", "updated_at": "1602692700", "user": "kpedro88"}

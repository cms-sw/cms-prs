A piece was copies from\r\nROOT, but my guess the changes were never integrated back into ROOT.\r\n\r\nPlane3D is forward declaration here, but ROOT master (6.10.00) changed\r\nnamespaces holding it. Instead forward declaration lets use a complete\r\ntype ROOT::Math::Plane3D from ROOT (which is a typedef). Should work\r\nwith any ROOT version (6.08.XX, 6.10.XX).\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: David Abdurachmanov <David.Abdurachmanov@cern.ch>", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1491370195", "comments": 10, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1491215887", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fastsim-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "52ee4d0d0af1f56d49f7c29c1362d22825a80f13", "merged_at": "1491370195", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_1_X", "number": 18179, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Remove foward declaration for Plane3D", "updated_at": "1491370195", "user": "davidlt"}

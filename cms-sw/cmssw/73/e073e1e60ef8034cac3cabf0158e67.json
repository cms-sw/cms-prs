Now each\nStream has their own ProductProvenanceRetriever instance. In addition,\nthe DaqProvenanceHelper is still shared across Streams. The one piece\nof state that is being updated was a map which was trivial to change\nto a tbb::concurrent_unordered_map. In addition, the DaqProvenanceHelper\nhad its member data made private to better encapsulate its functionality.\n\nThe API change to DaqProvenanceHelper required FedRawDataInputSource\nto be updated to match.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1392118633", "comments": 6, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1392057197", "deletions": 16, "labels": ["core-approved", "daq-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "8bee1c9538e0ba44a10fcbc2190b4913ac9d379c", "merged_at": "1392118633", "merged_by": "nclopezo", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_1_0_pre5", "number": 2385, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fixed thread problem from reading provenance from file", "updated_at": "1394439770", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

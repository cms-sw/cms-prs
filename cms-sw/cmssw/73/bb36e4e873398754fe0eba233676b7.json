The original intention of 1-pulse fit was to reconstruct high energy hits because the contribution from OOTPU is negligible, so using only 1 pulse was thought to be enough. \r\n\r\nBut, this had effects on low energy hits as well. For low energy hits the 8-pulse fit is more appropriate because the relative contribution from the OOTPU is large. However, in many cases 1-pulse fit was used instead of 8-pulse fit because the relative uncertainty of the fit is large, and this allows 1-pulse fit to have small chi2. \r\n\r\nWe studied the possibility of using 8-pulse fit only, without the 1-pulse to 8-pulse switch [1]. In the slides you can see that 8-pulse fit describes digi better than 1-pulse fit in both high and low energy regimes, so we want to start MAHI with 8 pulses. Same conclusion can be drawn from the study with PU [2].\r\n\r\nThis change is expected to impact on both data and MC. \r\n\r\nThis change is to be effective for Run3 and beyond only.\r\n\r\nIt passed `runTheMatrix.py -l limited --ibeos`.\r\n\r\n[1] https://indico.cern.ch/event/913567/contributions/3841987/attachments/2029001/3395305/Mahi_Chi2Switch_for-Run3_29thApril.pdf\r\n[2] \r\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/911693/contributions/3857751/attachments/2035263/3407350/Simulation_Run3_PU.pdf", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1589297345", "comments": 106, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1588376603", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "hlt-approved", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "07e298b2d01e394bf3c25b94497cecfacd58024b", "merged_at": "1589297345", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 29617, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 7, "state": "closed", "title": "[HBHE] Always use 8 pulses in MAHI without 1-pulse to 8-pulse switch for Run3 and beyond", "updated_at": "1589297345", "user": "jaehyeok"}

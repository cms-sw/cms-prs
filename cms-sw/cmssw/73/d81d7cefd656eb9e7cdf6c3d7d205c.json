This product includes non-zero suppressed Tracker FEDs and may be the cause why in some HI runs, DQM streamer files are way over the 2GB limit. Therefore, we tested the DQM client codes with a test streamer that does not contain `FEDRawDataCollection_rawDataCollector_*_*` and see if any DQM client crashes. We found the crash of this client `fed_dqm_sourceclient-live` could be easily fixed with the change of inputTag for `hcalFEDIntegrityTask.tagFEDs`.\r\n\r\nWith this update, the client `fed_dqm_sourceclient-live` could run on streamers that either include rawDataCollector or not. The PR does not rely on other PRs.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nMore information could be found in [PR 43120](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/43120)\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

Likewise there were some conversions of unsigned values to negative floats which had to be casted appropriately.\n\nThere was also a minor refactorization of the code, mainly to use std:array where ever possible, and sticking configuration data inside an \"hgc_digi\" namespace.\n\nI'll post some plots later that demonstrate the now-functioning digitization.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 14, "closed_at": "1449471684", "comments": 24, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1448625170", "deletions": 120, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "24ccb8e21a1c326a829c1f19d8042158e1d358eb", "merged_at": "1449471684", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 12584, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fixes to HGC-BH Digitization + Code cleanup.", "updated_at": "1449471684", "user": "lgray"}

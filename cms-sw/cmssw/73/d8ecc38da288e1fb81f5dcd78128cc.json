More specifically, I have:\r\n- Moved the LST workflows to use the latest default geometry (D110)\r\n- Made the `0.704` run on a GPU only if there is one, otherwise fall back to CPU (hardware-agnostic workflow, in accordance with the rest of heterogeneous workflows in CMSSW).\r\n- Replaced the custom binary search function with `std::lower_bound`.\r\n- Got rid of the warning about the `SeedStopInfo` size mismatch between the `TrackCandidate` and the `TrajectorySeed` collections.\r\n- Made a couple more minor fixes following up on PR integration comments (e.g. using `MessageLogger` instead of `printf`, renamings, etc.)\r\n\r\nI have tested the changes privately and the performance is exactly the same, so this is a technical PR.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 19, "comments": 22, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1734383226", "deletions": 82, "labels": ["dqm-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "pdmv-approved", "upgrade-approved", "code-checks-approved", "tracking"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_0_X", "number": 46967, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "open", "title": "Improvements to the LST workflows and small general LST fixes", "updated_at": "1734687452", "user": "VourMa"}

Partially these warnings are connected with the fact that  the new TrackingParticle does not keep vector of PSimHits anymore. Other warnings were due to absence access to Geant4 process type. This type is added to SimVertex because it is a natural property of verteces and not of hits. All warning disabled, no change of real results. \n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": "1380703857", "comments": 4, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1380698101", "deletions": 60, "labels": ["fully-signed", "simulation-approved", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "060aa054635e97eb16aa2735d4d6ea27f98fa6b3", "merged_at": "1380703857", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_0_0_pre5", "number": 970, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Simulation improvements -- Fixed warnings, added processType to SimVertex", "updated_at": "1380712726", "user": "civanch"}

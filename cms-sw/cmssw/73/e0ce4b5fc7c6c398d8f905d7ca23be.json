Nothing special to report, except:\n- To make the migration possible, we had to make the method \"softReset\" on MonitorElement public. Reason for this is that previously this method was called on the DQMStore, which would then call this method on the MonitorElement. Now that the DQMStore is as such not available anymore outside the booking scope, we have to call this method ourselves on the MonitorElement directly, so we had to make this public.\n- We also had to add the tagContents to the IBooker interface.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1421774534", "comments": 5, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1421348333", "deletions": 1746, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "e97a6fffab8d981557112c34db3a8ca8d6247554", "merged_at": "1421774533", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 7200, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Migrating HLXMonitor to new DQM API", "updated_at": "1421774534", "user": "vanbesien"}

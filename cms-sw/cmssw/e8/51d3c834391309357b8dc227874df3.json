In this case it affected the line `from . import offlineValidation` but for consistency I changed all the imports at the end of this file to be absolute. Need to think about if we want to change more towards absolute imports in this package in the future, but at least in the meantime this stops the production of CMSSW releases in which the TkAl AllInOne validation tool is not useable. \r\nNo other packages are affected.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nChecked that the AllInOne tool runs correctly after this change, not expected to affect any automated tests. \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1553331730", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["alca-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 26235, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "TkAl AllInOneTool: Moving to absolute imports at the end of presentation.py", "updated_at": "1553512623", "user": "adewit"}

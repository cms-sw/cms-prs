The authors of the above PRs will have to rebase once this PR is merged.\n\nThe separate numbering is implemented by adding a new dimension to the dictionaries used to construct the upgrade workflows. This foresees possible expansions, e.g. using 30000 for 2019 workflows.\n\nattn: @davidlange6 \n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1473698998", "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1473684997", "deletions": 60, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "pdmv-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "56d89b5c2f8dbb4d061e80555600757c584b3711", "merged_at": "1473698998", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 15817, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "separate numbering for 2017 and 2023 workflows", "updated_at": "1473822149", "user": "kpedro88"}

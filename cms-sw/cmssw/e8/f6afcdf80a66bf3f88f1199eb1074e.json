Although it is a temporary customization, I decided to \"erafy\" it because it is expected to be \"fixed\" around June (and I hope `phase1TkCustoms.py` is long gone by then). All occurrances of this and other temporary customizations should be found with `git grep \"phase1Pixe.*FIXME\"`.\n\nSubsequent steps are\n- Migrate rest of `phase1TkCustoms.customise_Reco()` to eras\n  - There is one issue that needs to solved, it is being discussed in #13381\n- Move what is now under `trackingPhase1` era to `trackingPhase1PU70` era, and put the \"new phase1 tracking\" (from #13149) to under `trackingPhase1` era\n\nTested in CMSSW_8_1_X_2016-02-23-2300 with `runTheMatrix.py -i all -l limited` for <= 2016 and `-w upgrade -l 10000,10039` for 2017 workflows. No changes are expected in monitored quantities (expanded job configuration files do change for both 2016 and 2017, but are functionally equivalent before and after this PR).\n\nThis is purely technical PR, no changes are expected.\n\n@rovere @VinInn \n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 32, "closed_at": "1457457386", "comments": 29, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1456393277", "deletions": 240, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "74ac5edf4a808b127954d8378462754515883b6f", "merged_at": "1457457386", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 13477, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 7, "state": "closed", "title": "Migrate 2017 tracking to eras", "updated_at": "1476957148", "user": "makortel"}

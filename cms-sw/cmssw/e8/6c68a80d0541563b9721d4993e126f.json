We noticed the problem by inspecting some events using Fireworks. \r\n\r\nVisualizing events produced with CMSSW_14_1_0_pre6 with the D99 geometry, with a dump of the Reco geometry done using CMSSW_14_1_0_pre1 (currently impossible to dump the geometry in CMSSW_14_1_0_pre6) we noticed some strange behaviour in the TICL Tracksters reconstruction. In [1] you can see how some of the LayerCluster are rotated with respect to the position of the Rechits. \r\nInspecting in more details the problem we decided to dump the position of one of these DetIds in the different releases\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n14_1_0_pre6: DetId 2485782895 position  (-63.1768,-51.3877,374.281)  (eta,phi) 2.22995 -2.45874 \r\n14_1_0_pre1: DetId 2485782895 position  (-80.4066,-12.9146,374.281)  (eta,phi) 2.22995 -2.98234 \r\n14_1_0_pre5: DetId 2485782895 position (-80.4066,-12.9146,374.281)  (eta,phi) 2.22995 -2.98234\r\nFix_14_1_0_pre6: DetId 2485782895  (-80.4066,-12.9146,374.281)  (eta,phi) 2.22995 -2.98234\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can clearly see that in 14_1_0_pre6 the detId is rotated by 30 degrees. This is fixed with this PR as you can see in Fix_14_1_0_pre6 . In [2] you can see the event display after the fix\r\n\r\n[1]\r\n![image_2024-08-23_12-08-58](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a4a2d1a-fa6f-4032-8c4b-767d1e0baabe)\r\n\r\n[2]\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55c8fcfd-5bde-4f7d-9b0f-482270c1b083)\r\n\r\n\r\n@felicepantaleo FYI", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 20, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1724410047", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["geometry-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "bug-fix", "urgent", "upgrade-approved", "code-checks-approved", "hgcal"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 45782, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Fix HGCAL Geometry - Revert `norot` back to False in `locateCell()` ", "updated_at": "1724489986", "user": "waredjeb"}

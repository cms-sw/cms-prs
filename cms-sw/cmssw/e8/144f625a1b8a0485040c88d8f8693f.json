However, in the hardware, LCTs are always centered at BX8. CSC DPG has asked to shift the central BX in simulation, so it agrees in hardware. \r\n\r\nThis pull request is the first step to make that happen. A constant `LCT_CENTRAL_BX` (with current value 6) is defined in `L1Trigger/CommonTrigger/interface/CSCConstants.h` so that it can be used in other packages. \r\n\r\nThe redefinition of BX6 should not introduce any changes to the L1 trigger performance in any workflow.\r\n\r\nThe actual shift BX6->BX8 will follow later after rigorous testing.\r\n\r\n@tahuang1991 @ptcox @abrinke1 ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 11, "comments": 11, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1517602002", "deletions": 23, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_1_X", "number": 22102, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Redefine central CSC LCT BX in CSCCommonTrigger/CSCConstants", "updated_at": "1518159921", "user": "dildick"}

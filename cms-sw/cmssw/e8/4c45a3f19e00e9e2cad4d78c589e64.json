I also added some protection to the rapidity calculation, since in previous version was calculated for all particles in the event, even those with very small energy. In the process I add the option of debugging.  \n\nAutomatically ported from CMSSW_8_1_X #15876 (original by @alberto-sanchez).", "branch": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1480315894", "comments": 8, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1479286239", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["comparison-available", "generators-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "3849aaa6407f2f8343051d5664acfe805e2209eb", "merged_at": "1480315894", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "number": 16641, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "single particle filter, add needed features", "updated_at": "1505316472", "user": "cmsbuild"}

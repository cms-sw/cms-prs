Issue #31198 requested a more explanatory error message for this case.This PR adds an error message that names the missing solid and recommends to the user that the XML files need to be re-ordered to prevent references to undefined solids.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe XML geometry configuration for Phase 2 D88 was re-ordered so that the `muonBase:MUON` solid was referenced before it was defined by moving `cavern.xml` before `muonBase.xml`. This bad order then generated the new error message.\r\n\r\nNo backport is needed.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1646237218", "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1646174731", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["geometry-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "21106cf75283106633123f00ccb0bd48bde0fb29", "merged_at": "1646237218", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 37112, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "[DD4hep] Add error message for undefined solid", "updated_at": "1646237218", "user": "cvuosalo"}

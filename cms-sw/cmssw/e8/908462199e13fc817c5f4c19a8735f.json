Issue #31198 requested a more explanatory error message for this case.This PR adds an error message that names the missing solid and recommends to the user that the XML files need to be re-ordered to prevent references to undefined solids.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe XML geometry configuration for Phase 2 D88 was re-ordered so that the `muonBase:MUON` solid was referenced before it was defined by moving `cavern.xml` before `muonBase.xml`. This bad order then generated the new error message.\r\n\r\nNo backport is needed.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1646174731", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["geometry-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 37112, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[DD4hep] Add error message for undefined solid", "updated_at": "1646175210", "user": "cvuosalo"}

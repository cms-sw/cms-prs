{"additions": 23, "auther_ref": "ArrayAndClassVersionFixes", "auther_sha": "e11560345ebc12975f629bc70c0e2d7d1036834d", "author": "wmtan", "body": "Fixes for some more fatal relval errors in the ROOT6 IBs.\n1)Incremented the version numbers for two more classes whose checksums have changed between ROOT 5 and ROOT 6.\n2) Added functions to TypeWithDict to get the number of dimensions oc a C style array, and the maximum index value for each dimension.  Call the new function maximumIndex() in  InlineCArrayStreamer.cc to fix a bug where arrayLength() was used instead. arrayLength() is the product of the maximum indices for each dimension, so for multidimensional arrays we would run off the end of the array.\nNote:  These fixes will not be visible in the results of the relvals in the IB's because another error is hit first. I am using a workaround for the other error in my tests.  I have not pull requested the workaround because it requires a root file of more than 100MB.\nPlease merge this request promptly unless there are problems.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_ROOT6_X", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1395180749", "comments": 1, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1395180262", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["core-pending", "db-pending", "geometry-pending", "l1-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "b3609149fe0c0909e8826ddd2637d9ed216435da", "merged_at": "1395180749", "merged_by": "davidlt", "number": 2922, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Array and class version fixes", "updated_at": "1395418440", "user": "wmtan"}

The PR effects only NANOAOD and NANOEDM files. \r\n\r\nWe update the nano-config file needed for regression-based refinement are included for FastSim Run 3 ak4 PUPPI jet variables, effecting only the NANO-level collections: \r\n\r\nJet_pt\r\nJet_btagDeepFlavB\r\nJet_btagDeepFlavCvB\r\nJet_btagDeepFlavCvL\r\nJet_btagDeepFlavQG\r\nJet_btagUParTAK4B\r\nJet_btagUParTAK4CvB\r\nJet_btagUParTAK4CvL\r\nJet_btagUParTAK4QvG\r\n\r\nThe results of the refinement compare the refined FastSim, original FastSim, and FullSim distributions for these variables:\r\nhttps://www.desy.de/~beinsam/FastSim/Refinement/Jets/figs31July_long/index.html\r\n\r\nThe PR also adds 9 backup branches \r\n\r\nJet_ptunrefined\r\nJet_btagDeepFlavBunrefined\r\nJet_btagDeepFlavCvBunrefined\r\nJet_btagDeepFlavCvLunrefined\r\nJet_btagDeepFlavQGunrefined\r\nJet_btagUParTAK4Bunrefined\r\nJet_btagUParTAK4CvBunrefined\r\nJet_btagUParTAK4CvLunrefined\r\nJet_btagUParTAK4QvGunrefined\r\n\r\nwhich store the original values, as a temporary measure for risk mitigation.

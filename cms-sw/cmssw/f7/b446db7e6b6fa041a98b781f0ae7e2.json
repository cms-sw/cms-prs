The problem with edmClassVersion needs to be fixed separately, because the checksum it calculates can depend on build order of the packages.\nThis pull request supplies the missing dependency, and updates the checksum accordingly.\nPlease merge this request as soon as convenient.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_ROOT6_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1421784946", "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1421784381", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "b5a1d2609610591a31fa00244dece8ea312ca6c2", "merged_at": "1421784946", "merged_by": "davidlt", "number": 7292, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add mssing link dependency and fix checksum", "updated_at": "1421785158", "user": "wmtan"}

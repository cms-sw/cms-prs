After having tested the effect of its backport https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/41879 into the CMSSW_13_0_X branch (via a [replay of CMSSW_13_0_7_patch1](https://github.com/dmwm/T0/pull/4838) and having checked the output at [1]) it became apparent that few of the ME-s introduced in #41879 are not useful, as they are produced in the harvesting step:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/2a83dec349e4276b8feddee48992423ad657e8a7/DQMOffline/Trigger/python/TrackingMonitoring_Client_cff.py#L32-L59\r\n\r\nand as such cannot be saved per-LS basis at the DQM first step. \r\nThis PR is technically a no-op, since it's not affecting anything at any level, but I have been requested to clean-up the file to remove possible sources of confusion later on.  \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nValidated in master.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

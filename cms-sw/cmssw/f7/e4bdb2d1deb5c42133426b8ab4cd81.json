This should be temporary until the full kBMTF/GMT muon objects are available with all fixes.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTaken from https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/43869\r\n> New FEVTDEBUG has the required objects.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

It is being backported in the hopes that HLT can include these objects in their Phase 2 MC production cycle, to be performed on CMSSW_14_0\r\n\r\n@artlbv @cbotta @epalencia FYI.

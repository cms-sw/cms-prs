Also, std::make_unique is used when appropriate. Also, there were a few cases where a reference to an auto_ptr was an input argument to a function, which is a bad practice because it obscures the possible transfer of ownership. This was corrected.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 47, "closed_at": "1472708797", "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1472577296", "deletions": 200, "labels": ["alca-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "b82e59ebef0368a3c19c4b33da3e379598a6b030", "merged_at": "1472708797", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 15668, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Use unique_ptr, not auto_ptr in some Reco* packages", "updated_at": "1472948344", "user": "wmtan"}

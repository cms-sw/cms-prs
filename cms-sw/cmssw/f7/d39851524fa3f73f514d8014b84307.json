I'm not sure if this feature would be really useful for ESSources, because for GPUs the use case is really about transferring data from existing ESProducts on existing Records, but it was tiny bit simpler to allow the mechanism also for ESSources. For Loopers the mechanism is explicitly disabled.\r\n\r\nResolves https://github.com/makortel/framework/issues/435\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nFramework unit tests run.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 14, "closed_at": "1663255808", "comments": 12, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1663156904", "deletions": 108, "labels": ["core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "bf366b761f3bb12ea3eea4ebb01bb44a8b68fba8", "merged_at": "1663255808", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_6_X", "number": 39391, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "Extend alternative module type loading to EventSetup", "updated_at": "1663255809", "user": "makortel"}

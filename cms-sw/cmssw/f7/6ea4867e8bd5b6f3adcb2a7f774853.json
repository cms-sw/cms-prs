It was checked that all newly added dependencies are actually required by the package with `git grep`.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": "1601980793", "comments": 14, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1601831203", "deletions": 8, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "50769d0804b2a858c7db42c85e77827bba2b4561", "merged_at": "1601980793", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 31663, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Clean BuildFiles in DetectorDescription", "updated_at": "1602153099", "user": "guitargeek"}

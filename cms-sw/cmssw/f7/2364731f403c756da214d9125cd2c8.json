Its primary use case is to remake the pre-splitting SiPixelClusters from the split ones to allow re-running of the tracking sequence from the RECO data tier.\r\n\r\nThis PR slightly modifies the SiPixelCluster DataFormat code but without changing the format version. The only effect will be a slight increase in the size of the `siPixelClusters` collection. All other objects downstream from the pixel clusters should remain unchanged.\r\n\r\n**Update (Nov. 7, 2016):** Rebased to CMSSW_8_1_X_2016-11-07-1100\nAutomatically ported from CMSSW_8_1_X #16393 (original by @ferencek).", "branch": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "changed_files": 8, "closed_at": "1479971457", "comments": 9, "commits": 10, "created_at": "1479285945", "deletions": 113, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "b8eb26bac9ccf175187b889256eff28bd9f08059", "merged_at": "1479971457", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "number": 16623, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Reclustering of SiPixelClusters", "updated_at": "1480449510", "user": "cmsbuild"}

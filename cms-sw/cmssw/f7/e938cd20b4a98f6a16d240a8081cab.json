Two are responsible for setting up the communication channels and coordinate the event processing:\r\n  - a \"remote controller\" called MPIController;\r\n  - a \"remote source\" called MPISource; and two are responsible for the transfer of data products:\r\n  - a \"sender\" called MPISender;\r\n  - a \"receiver\" called MPIReceiver.\r\n\r\nData products can be serialised and transferred using the trivial serialisation from HeterogeneousCore/TrivialSerialisation - if available - or the ROOT-based serialisation.\r\n\r\nVarious tests are used to validate the implementation: matching the local and remote event id, transferring SoA products with trivial serialisation, and transferring legacy product with ROOT serialisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nSee #32632.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.\r\n\r\nBackport of #32632 and #49935 to 16.0.x for testing online in parallel to the 2026 data taking.", "branch": "CMSSW_16_0_X", "changed_files": 30, "comments": 10, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1769251192", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "backport", "heterogeneous-pending", "changes-dataformats", "ngt"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_0_X", "number": 49930, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Extend CMSSW to a distributed application over MPI [16.0.x]", "updated_at": "1769444669", "user": "fwyzard"}

L1 matching requires propagation to MB2/ME2, which is avoided by using the muon matching information. HLT matching is complicated by lack of a single muon hlt object producer and name changes of the primary producers during Run2. Fortunately in practice we almost always had just one primary muon producer used in all the main triggers, so the matching is solid and covers majority of use cases (it is not meant to replace results of advanced archaeology that one may want to do in a case of some special triggers).

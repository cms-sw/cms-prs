If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nNot a backport, might be useful to backport to 14.0.X if accepted.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1716477283", "comments": 12, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1715751546", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "requires-external", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "9012dcc5125abf1cc3adf6812d3ae9102c8cfc12", "merged_at": "1716477283", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 44971, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "update data used for the Pixel,ECal,HCal GPU online DQM clients for post-alpaka migration in the HLT menu", "updated_at": "1716477284", "user": "mmusich"}

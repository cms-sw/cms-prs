The main changes are: 1) H/E variable is now cone-based instead of tower-based (as was in Run2 Fall17 ID); 2) PF Photon Isolation and Neutral Hadron isolation variables are now replaced by ECal Cluster Isolation and HCal Cluster Isolation; 3) H/E variable is now pile-up corrected with quadratic polynomial in rho; 4) Pile-up correction with quadratic polynomial in rho is done for isolation variables as well. \r\nAdditional documentation can be found in the following:\r\n1. https://indico.cern.ch/event/1204275/#5-update-on-run3-photon-cut-ba\r\n2. https://indico.cern.ch/event/1204277/#5-update-on-run3-photon-cut-ba  \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe PR has been tested using the following workflows by running 'runTheMatrix.py'\r\n1) 12434.0    \r\n2) 11834.0    \r\n3) 10024.0    \r\n4) 136.874\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 18, "closed_at": "1668697913", "comments": 35, "commits": 12, "created_at": "1667401387", "deletions": 98, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved", "xpog-approved", "egamma"], "merge_commit_sha": "5a51d535eb386d2a43d5efac417d1c95ab477366", "merged_at": "1668697913", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_6_X", "number": 39963, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 30, "state": "closed", "title": "Cut based photon id run iii winter22", "updated_at": "1668697914", "user": "shdutta16"}

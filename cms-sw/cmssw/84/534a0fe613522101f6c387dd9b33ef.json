Notable updates\n- New plots\n  - Efficiency and fake rate vs. pileup\n  - Fake rate etc. vs. seeding layer set (histograms added in just-merged #14248)\n  - Produce vertex validation plots also for FastSim (now that vertex validation is included there)\n  - Time per built track and per selected high-purity track for each iteration\n- Add a set of \"extended\" plots that are not produced by default, but e.g. with `makeTrackValidationPlots.py --extended`\n  - For now these include the distributions of all/true/fake/duplicate tracks vs. the same quantities as the fake/duplicate/pileup rate plots are made\n\nTested in 8_1_0_pre3, no changes expected in standard workflows.\n\n@rovere @VinInn \n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": "1463119970", "comments": 8, "commits": 16, "created_at": "1462356862", "deletions": 175, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "b95a7360aed4407289269c40e1e81c9d6f8c59ae", "merged_at": "1463119970", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 14372, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Update tracking MC validation scripts", "updated_at": "1492588056", "user": "makortel"}

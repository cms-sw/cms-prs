Remove DQM and validation steps from RECO part of workflow.\r\n2. Put PAT step into separate miniAOD part of workflow.\r\n3.

Workflows are forwarded to the standard matrix for D35 ttbar, 0PU and 200PU (classic mixing): 27434.21, 27634.21\r\n\r\nSetting this up for premixing might be more difficult... @makortel ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "comments": 18, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1550782459", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "upgrade-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 25996, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "open", "title": "Introduce production-like matrix workflow for Phase 2 performance profiling", "updated_at": "1550856858", "user": "kpedro88"}

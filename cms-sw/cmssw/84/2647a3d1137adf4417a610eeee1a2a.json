It utilizes `hltScoutingMuonPackerVtx` and `hltScoutingMuonPackerNoVtx` for muons, and `hltScoutingEgammaPacker` for electrons. We require leptons to have opposite charges and satisfy specific electron and muon ID requirements (also introduced in this PR). The analyzer includes a barrel/endcap split for electrons and provides dedicated \"zoom\" views for the Z and J/ resonance windows.\r\n\r\n`ScoutingPi0Analyzer`: monitors the 0 decay. It implements a reduction to the combinatorial background, producing a diphoton invariant mass spectrum in the expected signal range.\r\n\r\n`ScoutingCollectionMonitor` updates: histogram titles and labels have been updated for better readability, concretely replacing PDG IDs with the names of the particle.\r\n\r\n`ScoutingRechitMonitoring` updates: following discussions in the HLT Scouting meeting, we have updated the labelling of RecHit monitoring. The previous \"All\" and \"Cleaned\" labels were misleading and have been renamed to \"Accepted\" and \"Rejected\" for better clarity.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis PR was validated as follows:\r\n```\r\ncmsrel CMSSW_16_0_X_2026-02-17-2300\r\ncd CMSSW_16_0_X_2026-02-17-2300/src\r\ncmsenv\r\ngit cms-addpkg DQM/HLTEvF DQM/Integration DQMOffline/HLTScouting HLTriggerOffline/Scouting\r\nscram b -j\r\nscram b code-format && scram b code-checks\r\nscram b -j\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe workflow was tested with:\r\n```\r\nrunTheMatrix.py -l  145.415 -t 4 -j 8\r\n```\r\nand\r\n```\r\ncmsRun DQM/Integration/python/clients/scouting_dqm_sourceclient-live_cfg.py inputFiles=/eos/cms/store/group/tsg-phase2/user/jprendi/NERD25/MoreStats/EGammas/HLT/HLT_run_398858_job6_Scouting.root\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning `git cms-checkdeps -a -A` shows further dependencies to DQMOffline/Configuration`.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

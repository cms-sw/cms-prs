So, there is no schema evolution capability.  Any checksum difference between ROOT 5 and ROOT 6 in a class read from the conditions database causes a fatal checksum error.\nThis workaround opens and closes a file containing conditions classes with streamer information at the beginning of the job.  This allows the normal schema evolution to work.\nPlease merge this pull request promptly unless there are issues.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_ROOT6_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1396026830", "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1396026664", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "core-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "6d4a7ccfff0a29eed9c2adef9a10955d2173904a", "merged_at": "1396026830", "merged_by": "davidlt", "number": 3082, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Workaround for ROOT6 checksum changes in conditions database", "updated_at": "1404396001", "user": "wmtan"}

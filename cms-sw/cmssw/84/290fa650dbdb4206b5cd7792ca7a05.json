Most of the extra time is spent building the necessary structures for pos calc and then in poscalc it is spent searching for the rechits in the sorted collection.\n\nSince the PFClusters have the refs to the rechits that compose them, searching for the associated rechit again isn't really necessary. \n\n@argiro : Perhaps we could factor apart the rechit energy determination and position weighting parts of PositionCalc into two steps? If the sorted rechit collection wasn't required for the latter it would speed things up significantly in PFClusterAlgo.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1380703747", "comments": 29, "commits": 9, "created_at": "1379257133", "deletions": 180, "labels": ["fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "d4e50f4e0475142cb0f8f4cfa6236764816a708d", "merged_at": "1380703747", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_0_0_pre5", "number": 837, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "Reco Updates -- Fix ParticleFlow ECAL Cluster timing.", "updated_at": "1380703747", "user": "lgray"}

One cannot exclude regression due to the sensitivity of G4 to small path deviations.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 7, "comments": 7, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1658735651", "deletions": 28, "labels": ["simulation-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 38849, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 17, "state": "open", "title": "Optimized version of G4 Dormand Prince RK stepper", "updated_at": "1658816947", "user": "VinInn"}

One cannot exclude regression due to the sensitivity of G4 to small path deviations.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1659493373", "comments": 33, "commits": 10, "created_at": "1658735651", "deletions": 27, "labels": ["simulation-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "be16b470aa9983423e1b6eaf3c5c703a7a1de612", "merged_at": "1659493373", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 38849, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 22, "state": "closed", "title": "Optimized version of G4 Dormand Prince RK stepper", "updated_at": "1659493374", "user": "VinInn"}

One cannot exclude regression due to the sensitivity of G4 to small path deviations.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "comments": 17, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1658735651", "deletions": 27, "labels": ["simulation-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 38849, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 22, "state": "open", "title": "Optimized version of G4 Dormand Prince RK stepper", "updated_at": "1658993866", "user": "VinInn"}

This `dd4hep::Solid::name()` method tries to de-reference a null pointer, causing a segfault, when the object is invalid.\r\nTo fix this problem, a call to `Solid::isValid()` is added to ensure that the object is valid before trying to get its name.\r\nThe DD4hep team will be changing the behavior of `Solid::name()` to raising an exception instead of segfaulting in the case of an invalid object, but the approach in this PR of checking for validity is our preferred solution to the problem\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe script with the segfault was tested with this fix to ensure that the bug is gone. This fix should not change any standard workflows.\r\n\r\nNo backport needed.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1576345548", "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1576260750", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "78e6c643abc5e6dd959f73571d743883cd68ff4c", "merged_at": "1576345548", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 28623, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "Prevent segfault if dd4hep::Solid is not valid", "updated_at": "1576345548", "user": "cvuosalo"}

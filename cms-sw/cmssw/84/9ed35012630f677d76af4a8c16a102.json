In order to remove this last vestige of boost::shared_ptr,\nusers of EventSetup need to be converted to std::shared_ptr. This PR does this for Analysis packages.\nAlso, std::make_shared is implemented where it makes sense, because it simplifies the code and saves a memory allocation.\nThis PR is totally technical.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 18, "closed_at": "1459933382", "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1459602976", "deletions": 57, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-rejected"], "merge_commit_sha": "b44e5773028dc2c0439a572703611e9412cfda62", "merged_at": "1459933382", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 13894, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "use std::shared_ptr and std::make_shared (EventSetup in Analysis)", "updated_at": "1464230191", "user": "wmtan"}

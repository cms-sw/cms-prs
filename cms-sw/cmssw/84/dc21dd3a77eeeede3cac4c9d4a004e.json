Deleted very outdated paths that were commented to clean the code. Histograms related to paths not claimed are not created anymore, and histograms related to paths that were claimed but were not being monitored will be added.\r\n\r\nCompletely removed variable l1MET from the code, as it was not used in the validation (since it was not being produced as described in #36916), and, after the changes in #36916, configuration file [hltExoticaValidator_cfg.py](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/HLTriggerOffline/Exotica/test/hltExoticaValidator_cfg.py) could not be executed due to the usage of a non existing label `l1METLabel` in [hltExoticaMETplusTrack_cff.py](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/HLTriggerOffline/Exotica/python/analyses/hltExoticaMETplusTrack_cff.py).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nChecked removed and added paths histograms using RelVal datasets, and everything is as expected.\r\n\r\nWhen commented label `l1METLabel` in [hltExoticaMETplusTrack_cff.py](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/HLTriggerOffline/Exotica/python/analyses/hltExoticaMETplusTrack_cff.py), the configuration file [hltExoticaValidator_cfg.py](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/HLTriggerOffline/Exotica/test/hltExoticaValidator_cfg.py) worked normally again, but the execution of command `runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos -t 8` for validation, exhibited several failing workflows as shown in [1]. Upon removing l1MET from code, execution of `runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos -t 8` exhibit a failure in workflow 2018.1 with ret= 35072 (is this a memory issue only?) [2]. After running command `runTheMatrix.py -l 2018.1 -t 8`, got no failures [3].", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 31, "comments": 5, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1646910470", "deletions": 323, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 37192, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Update of Exotica HLT validation monitored paths and removal of l1MET from code", "updated_at": "1646926839", "user": "borzari"}

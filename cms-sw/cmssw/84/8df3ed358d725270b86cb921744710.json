The effect of this change should be almost invisible in data relvals.\n\n@grasph @argiro @ferriff please also follow this\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1429220051", "comments": 7, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1429173122", "deletions": 11, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "a2ffc264a4caa377415510e6dbd3f7fe000a8ac6", "merged_at": "1429220051", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 8759, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "ECAL unpacker: consider the ADC hysteresis in the gain switches", "updated_at": "1434460622", "user": "emanueledimarco"}

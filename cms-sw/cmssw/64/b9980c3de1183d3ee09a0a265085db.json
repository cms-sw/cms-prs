This is the second in a series of PRs where we plan to make the behavior after exceptions more consistent in all the begin/end transitions. The first PR handled stream begin/end lumi exceptions (see #44624). The comments at the head of that PR state the design for this behavior we are implementing.\r\n\r\nThe intent is that nothing in the output will change if there are not any exceptions.\r\n\r\nThis work was motivated by discussions related to Issues https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/43831 and https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/42501.\r\n\r\nThis PR also adds some new exception context information for exceptions occurring in service functions related to begin/end transitions.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nAn existing unit test covering exceptions in different transitions is extended to cover the most salient cases. Additional manual testing of many various cases was also done. Existing unit tests pass.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 16, "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1713968771", "deletions": 219, "labels": ["core-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 44840, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 9, "state": "open", "title": "Improve behavior after exception in begin/end global lumi", "updated_at": "1714191676", "user": "wddgit"}

The tuning consists of the following modifications\r\n* increase Pt threshold for charged particles\r\n* relaxed (wrt current settings) requirements on dz and dxy [1]\r\n\r\nThe tuning is a result of study shown here [2] and is agreed with Tau POG conveners.\r\n\r\nThe PR is expected to modify output of all tau isolation discriminants in Phase2 workflows and has not effect in Run2 workflows.\r\n\r\nFYI, @isobelojalvo @steggema @rmanzoni \r\n\r\n---\r\n[1] Note: dz requirement is still tighter than for Run2\r\n[2] https://indico.cern.ch/event/737180/contributions/3044559/attachments/1669844/2678320/NotWeightedResults_18_6.pdf", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1529655983", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["code-checks-pending", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 23642, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Tune selection of iso particles for tauID at Phase2", "updated_at": "1529656000", "user": "mbluj"}

As explained in the [documentation of `os.execvpe`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.execvpe), this ensures that the stdout buffer is flushed before the `os.execvpe` call replaces the current process.\r\n>\r\n>Currently (i.e. without this PR), redirecting the output of `cmsDriver.py` to a log file may result in the latter not containining all the printouts of `cmsDriver.py` (if the `--no_exec` option is not used). This means that this PR will increase the size of the logs of RelVal tests in PRs.\r\n>\r\n>For further details, see also https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/40599#issuecomment-1407603855.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported, please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\n#40635\r\n\r\nSmall bugfix to `cmsDriver.py`. The main reason to backport this fix is avoiding false reports about large reductions of logs in every future PR to this release cycle (see https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/40650#issuecomment-1411586841 for an example). This fix alone does not warrant a new release, imho.\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1675265804", "comments": 6, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1675233863", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["operations-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "bug-fix", "orp-approved", "backport-ok"], "merge_commit_sha": "e0497b08405809e828c5d520b46a699006576f58", "merged_at": "1675265804", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 40658, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "`cmsDriver.py`: flush stdout buffer before call to `os.execvpe` [`12_5_X`]", "updated_at": "1675265805", "user": "missirol"}

To fix the saturation effect, the total energy of TPs is forced to be saturated when the saturation in the input LUT is found before the sum over depths and the peak finder algorithm. This is achieved in the implementation by having the map of saturated towers in `HcalTriggerPrimitiveAlgo` and check the saturation after the peak finder algorithm, to make the TP energy saturated if the saturation is found at the input level. This PR is only applicable for a Run3 condition and can be toggled off by the parameter `applySaturationFix` in `simHcalTriggerPrimitiveDigis`.  The detailed motivation and effect of changes of this PR are presented in [presentation by Taeun Kwon](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1049943/contributions/4416052/attachments/2268682/3852452/CMSWEEK_Commissioning_1TS_Scheme.pdf) from slide 14 to 21\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with a description of the feature proposed or problem addressed, specifying:\r\n  - what changes are expected in the output if any, \r\n  - what other PRs or externals it depends upon if any,\r\n  - link to any additional material useful to provide a documentation for this PR (slides, JIRA tickets, related pull requestes, hypernews, TWiki or Indico pages)  -->\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with a description of which tests have been performed to verify the correctness of the PR, including the eventual addition of new code for testing like unit tests, test configurations, additions or updates to the runTheMatrix test workflows -->\r\n\r\nA basic technical test was performed: `runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos`\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nThis PR is not a backport and shouldn't be backported.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with any link to  -->\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1624635526", "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1624580864", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["l1-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 34247, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Updates of the TP reconstruction algorithm to fix the TP energy saturation effect", "updated_at": "1624635527", "user": "TaeunKwon"}

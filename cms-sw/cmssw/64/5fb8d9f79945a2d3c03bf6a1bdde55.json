It would be better to avoid this to make the `ElectronSeedProducer` more maintainable. The entries in `fillDescriptions` have been reshuffled and commented to match the previous easy-to-read structure in the cfi file.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion, the `fromTrackerSeeds` parameter was finally removed completely, as it could not be disabled anymore anyway (the code would have segfaulted has reported in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/27541) and the standard tracker seeds should always be used now. That finishes what https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/28039 and https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/28133 started.\r\n\r\nAnother update is that the HoE values are not stored anymore in some unused vectors. I think this must be a remnant from removing the HoE values in the ElectronSeed class [1] two years ago.\r\n\r\nUnrelated to this, there is a separate commit that moves the forward declaration and implementation of `GsfElectronAlgoHeavyObjectCache` into the `GsfElectronAlgo` class. It was always a bit strange to me why many other helper classes for GsfElectronAlgo (that are also much longer) don't have their own files while the HeavyObjectCache (which really doesn't make sense to use in another context) does not. \r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/DataFormats/EgammaReco/interface/ElectronSeed.h#L16\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCMSSW compiles and local matrix tests pass.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\n\r\nNo backport intended.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 21, "closed_at": "1571924738", "comments": 21, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1571409569", "deletions": 284, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "pdmv-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "6a037a6f9545b28f28f6040ce314b499ea77c453", "merged_at": "1571924738", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 28213, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 4, "state": "closed", "title": "Remove manually generated cfi file for ElectronSeedProducer", "updated_at": "1571924738", "user": "guitargeek"}

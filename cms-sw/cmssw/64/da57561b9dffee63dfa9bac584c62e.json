This PR is a preliminary step in a campaign to convert the Geometry code to employ user-defined literals.\r\n\r\nThe changes in this PR do not appreciably change performance since the affected code is run only once at the start of simulation, but it does show the sort of changes entailed in the conversion to user-defined literals.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 14, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1536684758", "deletions": 42, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "geometry-pending", "hold", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_3_X", "number": 24509, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Start conversion to using user-defined literals for Geometry", "updated_at": "1537305991", "user": "cvuosalo"}

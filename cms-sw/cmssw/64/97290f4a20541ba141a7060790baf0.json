The new, D-shaped sectors comprise more than 512 modules, which is the maximum number of modules that can be accommodated using the bits presently allocated in ETLDetId. ETLDetId.h has been modified to fix this issue, by adding 2 bits. The new ETLDetId is backward compatible with the older versions, thanks to a dedicated compatibility code implemented in ETLDetId.cc.\r\n\r\nBoth ETL versions and the backward compatibility issue were presented at the last MTD DPG meeting (https://indico.cern.ch/event/919571/contributions/3864046/attachments/2039610/3415525/MTD_DPG_20200515.pdf )\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n- The dump geometries for scenario D50 using the old ETLDetId format and the new one described above have been compared: the logical volumes paths are the same, while the rawID differ only for the positions of the 2 bits related to the sensor modules, as expected.\r\n- relVal 23234.0 has been run too\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1600675706", "comments": 61, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1594042366", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-notrun", "hold", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "requires-external", "simulation-pending", "tests-rejected", "upgrade-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 30557, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "ETLDetId modified for future v5 ETL geometry", "updated_at": "1600675706", "user": "icosivi"}

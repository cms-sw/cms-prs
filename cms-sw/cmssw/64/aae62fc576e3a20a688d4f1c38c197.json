One bug used the wrong type for the local geometry, which violated an assumption made by the BaseTrackerRecHit here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/30a2ff8ff13aaa416259453b54ad0b62588edc91/DataFormats/TrackerRecHit2D/interface/BaseTrackerRecHit.h#L29\r\n\r\nThe second bug takes a reference to a vector element which can be invalidated if the vector resizes.  This fix preallocates the vector so that it does not resize.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTests were re-run in an ASAN build and verified that the bugs were fixed.  No effect on anything outside the package unit tests.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1575658313", "comments": 15, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1575389756", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "b9a850336de5857ec2d76c763787ca207189d221", "merged_at": "1575658313", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 28531, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix two bugs in CommonTools/Utils unit tests found by ASAN", "updated_at": "1575658342", "user": "dan131riley"}

Both are set by https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/RecoLocalCalo/HcalRecAlgos/interface/HBHEPulseShapeFlag.h and it still assumes that SOI is 4. \r\n\r\nThis PR fixes this issue by getting the SOI from HBHEDataFrame::presamples().\r\n\r\nSmall changes (increase in rejection rate) are expected in both data and MC in the R45 filter decision.

The commits are uploaded in EgammaMCTools because of the dependency on GEN (for matching) and SIM (to veto conversions using trackingParticles).\r\n\r\nWe need it for 90X in the context of the high-level PF studies for the 2017 run, but we are PRing here first (as it is required) and, after review and integration in 91X, we will immediately backport to 90X.\r\n\r\nThe PR does not alter any standard validation sequence since it is not run by default. It consist of 4 files: the EDProducer, the BuildFile to compile, the python cfi for the producer and a small test script that basically does what this tool is supposed to used to: make ECAL PF Cluster, make trackingParticles, match and select.\r\n\r\nAttn: @jainshilpi , @fcouderc \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1491895431", "comments": 37, "commits": 9, "created_at": "1490692668", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "generators-approved", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "1a078327af27289de3194a865471b4fee48d4bf6", "merged_at": "1491895431", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_1_X", "number": 18106, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 14, "state": "closed", "title": "PFCluster truth selector", "updated_at": "1491895431", "user": "rafaellopesdesa"}

In the prior pull request, caching was done only for valid types.  However, the conditions database also looks up types that are invaild. There is nothing wrong with this, but a default constructed TypeWithDict for an invalid type also needs to be cached.\nPlease merge this promptly unless there are issues.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_ROOT6_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1396027813", "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1396027401", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "core-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "011bb7e3112200b255cb878e1e54ac5b7d3bab1d", "merged_at": "1396027813", "merged_by": "davidlt", "number": 3084, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Cache invalid types also", "updated_at": "1404395970", "user": "wmtan"}

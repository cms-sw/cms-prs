These were\nchanged to return const pointers. This required changing variable types in calling classes\nhowever it turned out those classes never modified the objects anyway so no algorithmic\nchanges were neeed.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 23, "closed_at": "1383687719", "comments": 6, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1383577187", "deletions": 79, "labels": ["dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "hlt-approved", "l1-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "425ca4684a99a2a54d75f70af42de6507b189908", "merged_at": "1383687719", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_0_0_pre8", "number": 1314, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Classes in DataFormats/L1DTTrackFinder only return const * from const functions", "updated_at": "1384437394", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

Given the plan to add the information to `ProcessConfiguration` by replacing the so-far-pratically-unused https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/75451d59a7acc30aec874be9a6b9a8835f2f7b3e/DataFormats/Provenance/interface/ProcessConfiguration.h#L58\r\nwith this information, and to avoid any backwards or forwards compatibility issues, the `HardwareResourcesDescription` will be serialized to a string. For that purpose this PR adds a \"compact string serializer\" that serializes a list of `std::string`s and containers of `std::string`s into one string. A compact representation is achieved by using non-printable ASCII characters as the delimiters.\r\n\r\nA following PR will replace the `PassID` with the `HardwareResourcesDescription` in the `ProcessConfiguration` interface.\r\n\r\nResolves https://github.com/cms-sw/framework-team/issues/1172\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nAdded unit tests work.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": "1738248759", "comments": 18, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1737678286", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "e31698594198a4ee35cf36abefa21fb865215754", "merged_at": "1738248759", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_15_0_X", "number": 47175, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 6, "state": "closed", "title": "Add HardwareResourcesDescription class", "updated_at": "1738248760", "user": "makortel"}

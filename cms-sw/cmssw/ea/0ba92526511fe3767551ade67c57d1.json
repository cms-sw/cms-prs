So we have made a module which filters the HCAL digis around our reco::RecoEcalCandidates. We have tried to make it generic. \n\nOne thing I wasnt so sure about was where to stick the helper classes:\nEtaPhiRegion\nEtaPhiRegionData (and its base class)\nAs this is producer which wont be included by anything, its not doing harm in same header but I dont like it. Any suggestions on where to stick them (or just ignore it and leave it be).\n\nWe will need this before we can deploy our new H/E variable although its not an urgent bug fix, more an desired improvement\n\nCheers,\nSam\n\n@gpasztor FYI\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1468937750", "comments": 18, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1468237682", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "hlt-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "fb617f7897d6fcd0b1df82aefb29c238e937ee45", "merged_at": "1468937750", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 15163, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "HCAL Digi Filtering Module : 80X", "updated_at": "1468937750", "user": "Sam-Harper"}

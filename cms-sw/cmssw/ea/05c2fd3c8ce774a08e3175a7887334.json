It allows to produce the HLT Scouting collections when running the HLT as a 'step' of `cmsDriver.py`, which is what is done in MC productions.\r\n\r\nThe EventContents related to HLT are updated accordingly, adding the Scouting collections. This extends the content of the **RAW data tier** for MCs in `8_0_X` (because of the addition of the HLT Scouting collections). A [similar update was done for MCs in `9_4_X`](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/21295#issuecomment-344199165) when https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/21297 was backported to that cycle with https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/21295.\r\n\r\nExtra details for HLT.\r\n - An additional ad-hoc change is needed for TSG menus of `8_0_X`, to remove the smart-prescale modules from the Scouting (End)Paths when converting said menus to `cff` fragments.\r\n - The update of the subtables from `V253` to `V254` is unconsequential; there are no differences between `V253` menus and `V254` menus.\r\n\r\nSummary.\r\n - There are no changes to the HLT menus in `ConfDB`.\r\n - This PR includes the backport of a fix to (1) the routine that converts the HLT menus to `cff` python files (and the HLT-menu configs are updated accordingly), and (2) to the HLT EventContents.\r\n - The consequence is that the `cff` python files of HLT menus with Scouting will now include 2 more Paths with the Scouting \"packers\" (i.e. the producers of the Scouting objects).\r\n - A 2nd, more important, consequence is that this fix extends the data tiers involving HLT outputs, incl. the **RAW data tier**. The only change is the addition of the Scouting objects.\r\n - The same type of fix was backported years ago to `CMSSW_9_4_X` with https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/21295 for 2017 MCs (this PR is effectively the same fix for 2016 MCs, but done much, much, later).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTSG tests.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported, please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nPartial backport of #21297 (and #22943).\r\n\r\nUse case: future 2016 ultra-legacy MC productions (central or private).\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 15, "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1675700085", "deletions": 35, "labels": ["hlt-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started"], "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 40708, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 4, "state": "open", "title": "include Scouting packers and collections in MC production [`8_0_X`]", "updated_at": "1675955040", "user": "missirol"}

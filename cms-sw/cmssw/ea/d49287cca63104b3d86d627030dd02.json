This GT will be used in an upcoming test of the run-dependent MC procedure.\r\n\r\nAt this point, a simplified IOV structure with equally weighted IOVs is being used and so the HCAL tag only approximately represents the appropriate luminosity weighting of the HEM15/HEM16 failure and non-failure periods. Both the CSC and strips tags have minor technical changes that represent small deviations from 2018 for the purpose of validating the run-dependent machinery. All three will require updates once a more realistic 2018 IOV weighting is supported.\r\n\r\nThe GT diff is as follows:\r\n\r\n**2018 realistic (run-dependent)**\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/113X_upgrade2018_realistic_RD_v2/113X_upgrade2018_realistic_RD_v3\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nSee the presentations at the [22 Feb 2021 AlCaDB meeting](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1010099/) for details.\r\n\r\nIn addition, a technical test was performed: `runTheMatrix.py -l 250202.183 --ibeos`\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nThis PR is not a backport and should not be backported.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1614910086", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1614886399", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "9126a733f996b8f8a41d094069a5c0fea2da916e", "merged_at": "1614910086", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 33074, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Use run-dependent bad channels for CSC, HCAL and strips", "updated_at": "1614910086", "user": "christopheralanwest"}

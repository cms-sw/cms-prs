Right now the bits are redundant, but we expect more to be added in the future;\r\n* Added bits to non-tau blocks from cross triggers.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nReran NanoAOD for all three Run-2 years and in a Run-3 sample, everything seemed to act as expected. In addition tests run during integration to the master.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nIt is a backport of #38472; it is meant to become a part of nanoAOD v10.\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 6, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1656412484", "deletions": 13, "labels": ["fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "backport-ok", "xpog-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 38539, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Change tau trigger bits stored in NanoAOD [12_4_X]", "updated_at": "1656430830", "user": "mbluj"}

The cause of NaN values is not understood and the failure is not reproducible, but it's a very rare event and it is not expected to have any impact on physics results. The change is needed to prevent unnecessary exception and job failure.\r\n\r\nFor details see: https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/45398\r\n\r\nThe code is also modified a bit to separate protection against unset inputs from invalid input.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nAdd a unit tests, which tests all major use cases and their potential failures.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "comments": 12, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1720773444", "deletions": 12, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "ml-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 45439, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "open", "title": "Xgbooster protection", "updated_at": "1721665656", "user": "drkovalskyi"}

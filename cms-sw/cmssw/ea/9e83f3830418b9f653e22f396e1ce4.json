I am not sure any more that the other change applied here, i.e. the loop boundaries defined as `constexpr` instead of being variables, will be enough to shut up the build warning: in any case I didn't want to add further useless checks in the caller code.\r\nWhile doing so, I could not resist and applied a few very simple clean ups to the code. Therefore, l don't close this PR, but admittently it has a rather low priority...\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nIt builds.

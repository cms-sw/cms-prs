In the original implementation, every jet is assigned a \"jetTag\" value, and, when there is no valid Delta-R match with a jet in the JetTag map, then the tagValue is set to an arbitrary -1000. In this PR, jets without a valid DR-match are instead skipped; for realistic cuts on \"JetSumTag\", the two approaches should be equivalent from a practical point of view, and I would suggest to use one in this PR.\r\n\r\nSince the relevant plugins are not run in any central wf, the PR tests are not expected to be sensitive to this PR.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI manually checked with the recipe provided in https://github.com/cms-data/RecoBTag-Combined/pull/47#issuecomment-1033521156 (plus some edits to the config file, using one instance of the plugin with `MatchByDeltaR=false` and one with `MatchByDeltaR=true`) that the results of the HLT filters, and corresponding trigger objects, are exactly the same for 100 MC events.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nN/A", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 0, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1645018187", "deletions": 42, "labels": ["hlt-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 36981, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "small improvements to `HLTSumJetTag`", "updated_at": "1645018205", "user": "missirol"}

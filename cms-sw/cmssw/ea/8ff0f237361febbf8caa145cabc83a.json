Others will follow once the Run3 geometry and RP layout are in place, cf. #30252.\r\n\r\nThis PR contains the following updates\r\n  * simulation of timing RPs (diamonds)\r\n  * the previously single 2018 profile (settings) is replaced with 3 profiles, each reflecting one position of the pixel RPs (moved vertically during TS1 and TS2)\r\n  * the latest optical functions are used (those foreseen for the Run2 re-miniAOD), cf. https://github.com/cms-data/CalibPPS-ESProducers/pull/3\r\n\r\nThe \"direct\" simulation is not used in any central workflow, thus no change in these WFs is expected.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nSeveral validation plots are available in the PPS GM talk linked in the beginning.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 24, "closed_at": "1594140316", "comments": 15, "commits": 8, "created_at": "1593516522", "deletions": 86, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "operations-approved", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "199e6541f2e8f8a0825dab07dfccb37aadfb1378", "merged_at": "1594140316", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 30466, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "PPS: direct simulation update A", "updated_at": "1594140316", "user": "jan-kaspar"}

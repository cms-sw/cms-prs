In particular, it adds interface changes to streamTransitionAsync.h that were recently made in globalTransitionAsync.h so the two will remain similar. It also changes other interfaces from EventProcessor down the stack to the Worker classes.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRan existing unit tests. This should not change any behavior or any results. It just makes the code easier to read and understand.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 35, "closed_at": "1599853114", "comments": 29, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1596045300", "deletions": 723, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "core-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 30969, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 25, "state": "closed", "title": "Use TransitionInfo in more interfaces", "updated_at": "1599853115", "user": "wddgit"}

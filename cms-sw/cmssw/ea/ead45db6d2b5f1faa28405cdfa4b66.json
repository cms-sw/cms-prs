It allows for straightforward integration of the new detectors into the tracking geometries so that we can use tracks to pick timing hits. The next phase, after we establish the efficiency and purity that we can pick hits, is to extend the propagation and kalman fitting code to include an estimate of the particle's t0 so that we can take the time at detector back to the vertex using only reconstructed information.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1484550748", "comments": 28, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1484345963", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved", "urgent"], "merge_commit_sha": "66d4dd2d35db1b8cc2b966730d98f3e81269f401", "merged_at": "1484550748", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "number": 17176, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add timing detectors to GeomDetEnumerators", "updated_at": "1484550748", "user": "lgray"}

Such a cleaning is now done inside the BTL numbering scheme natively, causing the unit test and Geant4-based simulation to behave in the same way.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, all MTD geometry unit tests have been updated to scenario 2026D98 (identical to D95 as far as MTD is concerned, no need to update external references).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nUnit tests run without issue, the debugging printout of the numbering scheme and ```MtdSD``` is the same for 100 single muons tracked by Geant4.

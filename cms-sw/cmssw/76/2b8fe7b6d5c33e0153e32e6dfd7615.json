Please note:\n1) The new version has been tests for all relval sequences using 10 events (before the merge with the latest cmssw version). Updates have not been made to the new relval files. It is the request of the generator group that the physics is checked by running a full relval (maybe in a release with only changes to this) and all the relval contact be made aware of this change.\n2) The fragments that could not be updates since pythia8 lacks the required features:\nsteps['Higgs200ChargedTaus']=genS('H200ChargedTaus_Tauola_8TeV_cfi',Kby(9,100)) \nsteps['Higgs200ChargedTaus_13']=gen2015('H200ChargedTaus_Tauola_13TeV_cfi',Kby(9,100)) \n3) The susy fragments were not updated\nsteps['LM1_sfts']=gen('LM1_sfts_8TeV_cfi',Kby(9,100))\nsteps['LM1_sfts_13']=gen2015('LM1_sfts_13TeV_cfi',Kby(9,100))\nsteps['LM9p']=genS('LM9p_8TeV_cff',Kby(25,100))\n4) The seems to be a conflict with the pre-existing pythia8 fragments ADDMonoJet_13TeV_d3MD3_cfi.py and  ADDMonoJet_8TeV_d3MD3_cfi.py. The error message is:\nPythia 8 did not accept \"PartonLevel:MI = on\"\nThe new gen fragments have the same issue but with the new tune.\nADDMonoJet_13TeV_d3MD3_TuneCUETP8M1_cfi.py\nADDMonoJet_8TeV_d3MD3_TuneCUETP8M1_cfi.py\nThese fragments need to be fixed, but this bug pre-dates the update in this pull request.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_3_X", "changed_files": 103, "closed_at": "1417005066", "comments": 25, "commits": 34, "created_at": "1415444405", "deletions": 166, "labels": ["comparison-available", "generators-pending", "operations-rejected", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_3_X", "number": 6290, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Gensim update 7 3 x merged", "updated_at": "1421062887", "user": "inugent"}

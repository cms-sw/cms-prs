(That constructor in public in 7_5_X, so there is no issue in 7_5_X).\nThis does not cause a build error in 7_4_X because the function templates are never instantiated.\nIt is nonetheless a bug, as the functions will cause a compilation error if they are ever called.\nIn fact, in CMSSW_7_4_ROOT5_X, these functions are instantiated through the ROOT5 dictionary of class VersionedSelector, which causes three packages to fail to compile.\nSo this PR fixes all the current compilation errors in 7_4_ROOT5_X.  Since the same bug affects 7_4_X, this fix is being submitted for 7_4_X.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1436882465", "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1436818361", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "2f9f5f13001e9e611af994de047ca79b0ffcd0ed", "merged_at": "1436882465", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 10179, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Call public, not private, ctor of Ptr", "updated_at": "1436895388", "user": "wmtan"}

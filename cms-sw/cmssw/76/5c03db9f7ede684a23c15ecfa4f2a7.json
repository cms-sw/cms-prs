We expect that frequent data vs emulator comparisons will be necessary. I added a class `L1TdeCSCTPG` that dumps ALCT/CLCT/LCT key properties (half-strip, wire-group, BX etc.) into DQM MonitorElements for both unpacked stubs and re-emulated stubs. The histograms for data and emulator should be overlaid to compare, but I don't think the DQM does that by default. I may need to amend the PR with an extra module to take care of this.\r\n \r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested with WF 23634.0.\r\n \r\n23634.0_TTbar_14TeV+2026D51+TTbar_14TeV_TuneCP5_GenSimHLBeamSpot14+DigiTrigger+RecoGlobal+HARVESTGlobal Step0-PASSED Step1-PASSED Step2-PASSED Step3-PASSED  - time date Thu Aug 27 11:05:48 2020-date Thu Aug 27 10:21:22 2020; exit: 0 0 0 0\r\n1 1 1 1 tests passed, 0 0 0 0 failed\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nMay need to be backported to CMSSW_11_1_X to run in upcoming MWGRs.\r\n\r\n@jfernan2 @tahuang1991 ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 9, "closed_at": "1599654760", "comments": 22, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1598537696", "deletions": 54, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "dqm-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 31266, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Data vs emulator plots for CSC trigger primitives in Offline DQM", "updated_at": "1599654760", "user": "dildick"}

Package includes\nTLS/thread-safety patches.\n\nThis is experimental and currently is only available in DEVEL, glibc package is also available in THREADED, but changes in CMSSW were not present. The following adds identical changes as in DEVEL.\n\n`cmsRun*` currently becomes **bash** wrappers, thus be careful if you need to run `valgrind`. `gdb`, or similar.\n\nAlternative and best option is to post-install ELF patch and rewrite `.interp` section of selection executable binaries. You can find the instructions on the HN.\n\nSigned-off-by: David Abdurachmanov David.Abdurachmanov@cern.ch\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_2_THREADED_X", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1402909992", "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1402904455", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "core-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "2c394292ca1610c0c44a9ff5bbefadb1a40f7919", "merged_at": "1402909992", "merged_by": "davidlt", "number": 4265, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Use dynamic loader from CMSSW to load cmsRun", "updated_at": "1402909992", "user": "davidlt"}

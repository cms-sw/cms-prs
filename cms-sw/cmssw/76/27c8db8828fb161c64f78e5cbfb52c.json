I also added checks (LogWarnings, not selections) in the GEM trigger primitive producers.\r\n\r\n- The new GE2/1 geometry has 16 eta partitions (each strip split in 2), instead of 8 eta partitions. To prevent a miscommunication between GE2/1 TPs and the EMTF, or the GEM packer/unpacker, I added a member `part_` in the `GEMPadDigi` and `GEMPadDigiCluster`. This was requested by EMTF folks. This way it should be relatively easy to check which geometry you are dealing with by calling `nPartitions()`. \r\n\r\nNote: this supersedes PR #30624.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested with WF 23234.0.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nN/A", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 14, "closed_at": "1596735493", "comments": 25, "commits": 8, "created_at": "1596148284", "deletions": 36, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-notrun", "geometry-pending", "l1-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-rejected", "upgrade-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 30998, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 7, "state": "closed", "title": "Add number of partitions in GEM TPs", "updated_at": "1596735493", "user": "dildick"}

Currently it is the /dev/CMSSW_9_0_0/ menu. It will become GRun + reverse customization function, as soon as the function will be ready\r\n- update of the symbolic update to use the 'phase1_2017_realistic'\r\n- update of the input files/eras to run the phase1 menu\r\n- add 'HLT:@relval2017' cmsDriver option to peak the 2017 HLT menu and use it for the phase-1 relval production\r\n- changes in HLT addOnTests:\r\n  - add validation of GRun2016\r\n  - change Era from Run_2016 to Run_2017, except for GRun2016 \r\n\r\n\r\nOpen issues:\r\n- we are waiting for the reverse customization function to get a 2016-like menu from the current menu\r\n- one of the test will fail, because of a issue with EcalAlCaRecoProducers. It is caused by this line https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/CMSSW_9_1_X/Calibration/EcalAlCaRecoProducers/plugins/SelectedElectronFEDListProducer.cc#L309 . I strongly suspect that this code is not yet compatible with the Phase-1 pixels. I contacted HLT AlCa ( @trtomei ).\r\nCC: @mtosi @ndaci @georgia14\r\n90X PR: #17853 \r\n\r\nBased on CMSSW_9_0_X_2017-03-08-1100.", "branch": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "changed_files": 42, "closed_at": "1489418573", "comments": 51, "commits": 11, "created_at": "1489060199", "deletions": 123187, "labels": ["backport", "comparison-available", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "hlt-approved", "orp-approved", "pdmv-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "e4dc89f7a010734677cc378b50fb90e1d793e870", "merged_at": "1489418573", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "number": 17853, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Update HLT STORM validation to Phase1 (90X)", "updated_at": "1499403903", "user": "silviodonato"}

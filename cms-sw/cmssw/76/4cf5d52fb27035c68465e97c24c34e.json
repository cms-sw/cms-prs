Here we use a sampler (SAMPIC) instead of a TDC. Therefore, even if we can share part of the unpacker (for the OptoRx frames), the dataformat is substantially different.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces many modifications because an effective test is only possible using the TotemTimingDIGIs.\r\n\r\nSuggested test:\r\nEventFilter/CTPPSRawToDigi/test/test_standard_sequence_cfg.py\r\n\r\nData with this detector are available in:\r\n/store/group/dpg_ctpps/comm_ctpps/TotemTiming/Minidaq/519/\r\n\r\nFuture plan:\r\n- DQM using DIGI in preparation, PR soon\r\n- Geometry of the new detectors\r\n- Migration to db for mapping and geometry\r\n- RecHitProducer: we plan to produce the CTPPSDiamondRecHits, so that the rest of the code can be common with the CTPPS Diamond detector.\r\n- DQM using recHits\r\n\r\nWe are reasonably sure that all the bugs were fixed, however being a completely new detector, we foresee the possibility of other \"bugfixing\" PR.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n@fabferro ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 27, "comments": 49, "commits": 25, "created_at": "1522308684", "deletions": 151, "labels": ["alca-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "db-pending", "hold", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 22796, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 25, "state": "open", "title": "CTPPS: TotemTimingDigi, totemTimingRawToDigi and mapping for the new Timing detector in Vertical RPs", "updated_at": "1523044418", "user": "nminafra"}

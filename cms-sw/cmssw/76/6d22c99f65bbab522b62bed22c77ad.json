This did not help performance since the consumes calls would already prefetch all the data. To try to keep the same functionality, I switched to using callWhenNewProductsRegistered.\r\n\r\nNOTE: This functionality to get an alternative data product appears to only be run if the data file was generated in a CMSSW version before 4_2. Perhaps this entire code path could now be removed?\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 16, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1535142429", "deletions": 85, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-started"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_3_X", "number": 24387, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "open", "title": "Remove inappropriate use of provenance in EcalDeadCellTriggerPrimitiveFilter", "updated_at": "1535551099", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

Specifically, there are a few ways of defining R9, all of which might give slightly different values for the variable -- whether to use the zero-suppressed energy, whether to use the raw values for the energy, and so on. And so the current plots are sometimes a little difficult to interpret -- for example, there was an inconsistency noted in the R9 1D distributions between UL and EOY rereco for some samples, and we are investigating whether this has to do with the old definition.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nValidation of added SC energy and R9 definitions have been done by processing some sample runs with ECAL DQM code and uploading them to a private DQM GUI. Plots appear to have no issues.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1591202614", "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1591137632", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "039c38d90b0d9f21074581707c6860f5ecdc9595", "merged_at": "1591202614", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 30088, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "Adding new R9 plots to ECAL", "updated_at": "1591202615", "user": "alejands"}

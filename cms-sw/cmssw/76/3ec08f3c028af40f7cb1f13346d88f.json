Note, this still points to GNU\n  C++ standard library in GCC package, but there are special headers which\n  are compiler specific, those are picked up from Clang package.\n- Print severity level names instead numbers.\n- Fail if there are 'Error' or/and 'Fatal' level diagnotic messages.\n- Remove obsolete ignore rules. They should not be triggered as long as\n  include paths and arguments passed to libClang are valid.\n- This should resolve issue where `get_statement` could return `None`,\n  because compiler couldn't do a correct job due to missing/wrong\n  include paths or/and arguments.\n- Required for Clang 3.7.0.\n\nSigned-off-by: David Abdurachmanov David.Abdurachmanov@cern.ch\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1440430009", "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1439889969", "deletions": 7, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "a7b690c80780aa867c5c3a7676b940e5f5a43e07", "merged_at": "1440430009", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 10837, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "condformats_serialization_generate.py: fix include paths and fail on serious issues", "updated_at": "1440430009", "user": "davidlt"}

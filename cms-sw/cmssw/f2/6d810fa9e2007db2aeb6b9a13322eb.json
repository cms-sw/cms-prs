For this, it's using the central `SessionCache` struct introduced in #40284.\r\n\r\nThis is part of the planned changes documented in #40248, intended to treat all tf sessions as constant for model evaluation purposes and therefore preventing copies across stream module instances for saving memory.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation\r\n\r\nThere was no new functionality added to the `L1NNTauProducer`, so existing test cases should fully cover the changes.\r\n\r\n@clacaputo @yongbinfeng @valsdav", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 2, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1671120928", "deletions": 27, "labels": ["l1-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "number": 40333, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Move TF session in L1Trigger/L1NNTauProducer to global cache", "updated_at": "1671121437", "user": "riga"}

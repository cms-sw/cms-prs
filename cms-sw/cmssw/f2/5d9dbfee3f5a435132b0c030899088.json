This backports PRs #44447 and #44517. See Issue #44413 for related discussion.\r\n\r\nThese bugs were causing rare seg faults in IB tests. We believe they mostly only occurred when concurrent lumis were configured and multiple lumis were actually being executed. The failure actually observed seemed more common when lumis containing no events were being processed because it requires global end lumi transitions running at the same time. Even in those circumstances the failures are rare.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRelies on existing tests.\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 3, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1711992705", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["core-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "tests-started"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "number": 44584, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Backport spin lock bug fixes", "updated_at": "1711992980", "user": "wddgit"}

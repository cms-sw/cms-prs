It includes the first PR with full simulation of PPS, including the new SD for the tracker and timing detectors. It relies on the new proton transport, redesigned in order to allow the propagation using also the TOTEM parameterization for the realistic optics and HECTOR as well. It also includes a utility module that holds methods used by simulation and reconstruction (full and fast as well), isolated into a separated module to avoid duplication of maintenance efforts.\r\n\r\n@fabferro @jan-kaspar @dilsonjd @nminafra @forthommel @grzanka @setesami @nogima", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 215, "comments": 25, "commits": 14, "created_at": "1535642903", "deletions": 1006, "labels": ["code-checks-pending", "comparison-pending", "daq-pending", "fastsim-pending", "geometry-pending", "new-package-pending", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending", "upgrade-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_3_X", "number": 24420, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 19, "state": "open", "title": "PPS Full simulation + PPS proton transport with totem parameterization", "updated_at": "1536265706", "user": "mundim"}

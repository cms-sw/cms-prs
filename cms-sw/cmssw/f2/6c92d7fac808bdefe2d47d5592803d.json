The test gives also provision for running the `pede` one, but for timing reasons this is not exercised in central tests.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n`scram b runtests_test_MilleZmm` runs fine.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

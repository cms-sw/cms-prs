On the other hand they are still associated to the `SiPixel(2D)TemplateDBObject` in the menu that is used in the GT management tool, making the life of the DB operator complicated and error prone.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTechnical validation with the limited matrix:\r\n```\r\nrunTheMatrix.py -l limited -t 4 -j 8 --ibeos\r\n```\r\nrun without issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\nThis PR is not a backport.\r\ncc:\r\n@tsusa @tvami \r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 14, "closed_at": "1573677113", "comments": 17, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1573493712", "deletions": 273, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "db-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "e20d32e90e891357c5d0e7a0764b6639ddc106ef", "merged_at": "1573677113", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 28377, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Remove magnetic field-dependent Pixel Templates records", "updated_at": "1573677114", "user": "mmusich"}

This allows the rechit-level calibration of diamond detectors to be submitted in a follow-up PR (HPTDC time over threshold calibration conditions produced outside this scope).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTo be tested along with https://github.com/cms-sw/cmsdist/issues/4785, which enables to parse and produce the payload from an external (example) file through the `CondTools/CTPPS/test/ppsTimingCalibrationWriter_cfg.py` utility.\r\nLocal reco branch maintained in parallel, to be submitted when this PR reaches a more mature state. Validation SW tools part of this follow-up PR.\r\n\r\nBefore submitting your pull requests, make sure you followed this checklist:\r\n\r\n- [x] verify that the PR is really intended for the chosen branch\r\n- [x] verify that changes follow [CMS Naming, Coding, And Style Rules](http://cms-sw.github.io/cms_coding_rules.html)\r\n- [x] verify that the PR passes the basic test procedure suggested in the [CMSSW PR instructions](https://cms-sw.github.io/PRWorkflow.html)\r\n\r\ncc: @fabferro @jan-kaspar @jjhollar", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "comments": 14, "commits": 10, "created_at": "1552893858", "deletions": 31, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "db-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 26207, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[PPS] Conditions format update for diamond timing calibration", "updated_at": "1553503022", "user": "forthommel"}

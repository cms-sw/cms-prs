This allows the rechit-level calibration of diamond detectors to be submitted in a follow-up PR (HPTDC time over threshold calibration conditions produced outside this scope).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTo be tested along with https://github.com/cms-sw/cmsdist/issues/4785, which enables to parse and produce the payload from an external (example) file through the `CondTools/CTPPS/test/ppsTimingCalibrationWriter_cfg.py` utility.\r\nLocal reco branch maintained in parallel, to be submitted when this PR reaches a more mature state.

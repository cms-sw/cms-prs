The  L1 and HLT now included are currently the best approximation of what will eventually  develop into the MC 2015 trigger\n- fix for missing record in step3 (GBRWrapperRcd) still outstanding => will follow soon. \n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1377544760", "comments": 3, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1377524991", "deletions": 9, "labels": ["fully-signed", "operations-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "cef1b48539febd7b3cef99fed644d3d4e2f0e926", "merged_at": "1377544760", "merged_by": "ktf", "number": 617, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "13 TeV mc relvals pre8 re cycle 70x fixes and updates", "updated_at": "1405492926", "user": "franzoni"}

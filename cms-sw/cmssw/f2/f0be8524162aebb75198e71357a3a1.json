As discussed in 03/Nov release planning meeting this should be in 8_0_X only so #12169 will be closed.  Description from there:\n\nAdd a `Run2_2017` era that includes the Phase 1 pixel detector; and a `Phase2Dev` era for every Phase2 component that currently works in 76X. I'm not entirely convinced by the name `Phase2Dev`, if anyone wants it changed please comment here.\n\n~~Put in on 7_6_X, not sure if it should be 8_0_X only?~~\n\nCurrently no changes added to either scenario, I thought integration would be easier if that was done in separate pull requests. ~~Note that this includes #12124 otherwise there would probably be merge conflicts (EDIT - now no longer true; decoupled from #12124).~~\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1446732234", "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1446632929", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["comparison-available", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "6c68ec43bf417c25ec17e105f9e3878d67088ca9", "merged_at": "1446732234", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 12254, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add Phase1 pixel and Phase2 (2023) eras", "updated_at": "1446745286", "user": "mark-grimes"}

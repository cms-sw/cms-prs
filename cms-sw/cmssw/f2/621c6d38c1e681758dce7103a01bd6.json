The validation/sign-off should be concluded by May 18th. If a resolution cannot be achieved by this time, the rereco will proceed w/o addressing the HB issue. So, this PR is urgent.\r\n\r\nFYI @cms-sw/hcal-dpg-l2 @cms-sw/pf-l2 @cms-sw/egamma-pog-l2 @cms-sw/jetmet-pog-l2 \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nChecked with `11834.0` and with `--era Run3_2022_rereco`.\r\n\r\nThis PR is needed only for 12_4_X because 2022 data rereco will be done in 12_4_X only.", "branch": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": "1683555925", "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1683459174", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["operations-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "urgent"], "merge_commit_sha": "1ecf831b87dd9a0e21a3dc88164124d3a1ada3dc", "merged_at": "1683555925", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 41581, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "[12_4_X] New HB thresholds for 2022 data rereco", "updated_at": "1683555925", "user": "swagata87"}

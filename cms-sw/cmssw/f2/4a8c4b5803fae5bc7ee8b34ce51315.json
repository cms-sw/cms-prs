Simplifications of dictionaries because variadic templates are not necessary anymore\r\n2. Code simplifications because BlocksView holds views to all sublayouts \r\n\r\n\r\nIn a future PRs the code can be simplified even more because with kernels that use a BlocksView as input can work on the entire data. Hence, it is not necessarry anymore to have every sub-view as input. In this PR, however, I tried to make as few changes as possible to not blow up the PR too much. \r\n\r\n\r\n@felicepantaleo @leobeltra fyi", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 132, "comments": 13, "commits": 8, "created_at": "1767773553", "deletions": 1681, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "dqm-pending", "hlt-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending", "heterogeneous-pending", "tracking", "trk", "changes-dataformats", "ngt", "allow-Electricks94"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_1_X", "number": 49734, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 43, "state": "open", "title": "Remove PortableHostMultiCollection and PortableDeviceMultiCollection", "updated_at": "1767859690", "user": "Electricks94"}

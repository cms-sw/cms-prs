The HCal noise cuts were previously provided from HLT config. Now it is made GT-based. Although, we still keep the option open to use cuts from config file. If this is deemed unnecessary, we can remove the option and allow only GT-based approach.\r\n\r\nRelated PRs which are doing similar migrations: \r\n- https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/43025 for `RecoParticleFlow`\r\n- https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/43164 for `RecoEgamma`\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nTested with some Run3 WFs. \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 12, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1698998043", "deletions": 8, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "hold", "requires-external", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "number": 43176, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "open", "title": "Migrate RecHit-based rho producer to use HCal noise cuts from GT", "updated_at": "1699509390", "user": "swagata87"}

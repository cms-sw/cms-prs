An overview of the new code with some implementation details was presented at the MTD Simulation and Performance Meeting on June 8 ([slides](https://indico.cern.ch/event/735676/contributions/3034135/attachments/1664866/2668515/casarsa_BTLdigi.pdf)).\r\n\r\nSeveral new features have been introduced in the digitization code of the barrel MIP detector:\r\n- fluctuations in energy and time due to the photostatistics;\r\n- time-of-arrival reading at different thresholds on the signal pulse shape;\r\n- smearing of the time of arrival to account for the SiPM timing resolution, the SiPM DCR,  the electronic noise and the clock distribution.\r\n\r\nSome changes were also required in the MIP timing detector reconstruction package both to preserve the backward compatibility and not to affect the simulation of the endcap MIP detetector.\r\n\r\nThe new code was tested with runTheMatrix.py: it passed all the steps of a TTbar and a TTbar+PU workflow.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 25, "closed_at": "1530074955", "comments": 29, "commits": 14, "created_at": "1528961791", "deletions": 139, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "f448739187a9a6e8caeb37fb7b6a3ac13697996a", "merged_at": "1530074955", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 23584, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 27, "state": "closed", "title": "Simulation of the readout and digitization for the MIP timing detector barrel", "updated_at": "1530074955", "user": "casarsa"}

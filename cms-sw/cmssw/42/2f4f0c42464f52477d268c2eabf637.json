The code and algorithm were presented in the last GTT meetings and are summarised in the attached slides. \r\nOther than addition of code dedicated for this process, **the floating bits in the GTT producer needs to be increased as discussed in the previous meetings, discussed in the attached slides and mentioned in [1]. This is crucial for improving the precision of  meson reconstruction.** \r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/L1Trigger/L1TTrackMatch/Readme.md#status-october-2024\r\n[\r\n[BsPhiPhi_Phase2GTT.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18794636/BsPhiPhi_Phase2GTT.pdf)\r\n](url)", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 17, "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1739514256", "deletions": 9, "labels": ["l1-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-pending", "changes-dataformats"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 47348, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Add Bs ->   -> 4k analysis in GTT", "updated_at": "1739514281", "user": "sbaradia21"}

It also deduplicates some code since there were separate functions for standalone and CMSSW that played the same role.\r\n\r\nIt's mostly done, but we have a couple of questions (probably for @fwyzard or @makortel).\r\n\r\n1. Running on CPU works fine, but I'm still having issues with GPUs. The issue is with LCG dictionaries, as I described in [my Mattermost message](https://mattermost.web.cern.ch/cms-o-and-c/pl/jo9f68nzwbnmmkh38dr3qtf3fa). Initially, I thought that the ROOT name normalization issue that Matti mentioned could be the cause, but I think it's something else.\r\n2. I had to split an SoA collection into two, since part of it is created before LST and some needs to be modified during the algorithm (to add some extra data). Do you know of a good way to combine the two collections into some sort of combined view, or do we just need to keep using the two separately. (Obviously, we could just define some new struct or class, but that doesn't sound great to me)\r\n\r\nc.c. @slava77 @VourMa ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 59, "comments": 47, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1743768150", "deletions": 1579, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "hlt-pending", "core-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "heterogeneous-pending", "tracking", "tests-ib-failure", "changes-dataformats"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 47793, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 18, "state": "open", "title": "Migrate LST inputs to SoA collections", "updated_at": "1746004561", "user": "ariostas"}

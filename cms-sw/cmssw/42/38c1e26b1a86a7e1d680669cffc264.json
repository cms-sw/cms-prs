The output from the fragment does not change as a result of this PR (though the manner in which the user steers things does change  - as updated in the fragment).\r\n\r\nVerified that the new configuration runs with the photon being produced from either beam A or beam B (or both), that the default configurations for PbPb, OO, and XeXe work as expected, and that the user specifying new configurations also works. \r\n\r\n\r\nWill need to prepare backports for release needed for MC production (13_0_X). Note that the current release is also fine for initial MC production, this PR just allows for additional user-set options. \r\n\r\n@stahlleiton \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1711472225", "deletions": 71, "labels": ["generators-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 44549, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Make PYTHIA 8 photon flux more configurable.", "updated_at": "1711472705", "user": "hjbossi"}

This PR adds these input variables for the upcoming computation. The change is backward compatible.\n\nThe improvement in resolution has been tested in data and is small but non-negligible as the following plot indicates (red is the regression currently used and black is the regression we would like to use).\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5707503/12830968/48c89424-cb92-11e5-9008-860096ceea89.png)\n\nThe next plot shows an example of the improvement due to variables that indicates cracks/gaps as well as phi modulation. The plots shows how the energy scale in the gap is now better corrected (Ecal module boundaries are indicated with dashed lines).\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5707503/12830977/50a86dc2-cb92-11e5-8814-ecfbc57a93b6.png)\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1455035940", "comments": 30, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1454619307", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "69d6b2714887acba0cd4adadf93804871f7318a5", "merged_at": "1455035940", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 13199, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 5, "state": "closed", "title": "Add missing variables for photon regression with optimal performance", "updated_at": "1455196542", "user": "fcouderc"}

This affects both the CHS and Puppi AK4 jet tables, and **probably(?) affects the official production.**\r\n\r\n(2) Fix to the `nanoAOD_addDeepInfoAK4()` fucntion in the `jetsAK4_Puppi_cff.py`: *this should only affects private/custom productions.*\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with a description of which tests have been performed to verify the correctness of the PR, including the eventual addition of new code for testing like unit tests, test configurations, additions or updates to the runTheMatrix test workflows -->\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

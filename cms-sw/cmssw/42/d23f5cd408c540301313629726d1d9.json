This successful workaround, from the user of the feature, Yetkin Yilmaz, is a needed workaround for the problem.  It simply limits the hash comparison to the final 32 bits of the hash.\nWhen time permits, the cause of the truncation can be found and fixed, and the workaround removed.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1430009763", "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1429023003", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["comparison-available", "core-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 8732, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "temporary workaround for the truncated hash in the root file (7_5_X)", "updated_at": "1430009763", "user": "wmtan"}

The optimized architecture features two hidden layers, with 1024 and 2048 nodes, respectively.\r\n- Change to `TSGForOIDNN.cc` plugin: remove split into barrel and endcap; use one model for all muons.\r\n\r\nThe updated model is added to `cms-data`: https://github.com/cms-data/RecoMuon-TrackerSeedGenerator/pull/4. The older classifier models will not work with the updated plugin.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nSlides describing the update: [link](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1138348/contributions/4808414/attachments/2418040/4138306/20220330_OISeedingUpdate_JSchulte.pdf).\r\nThe performance was checked on J/psi (low-pT) and Drell-Yan (high-pT) datasets. Overall HLT efficiency is similar for all models, while the timing for the newly trained models is improved.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 15, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1648837124", "deletions": 24, "labels": ["hlt-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "urgent", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 37437, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Update to DNN-based strategy for outside-in seed generation in Muon HLT", "updated_at": "1649137272", "user": "kondratyevd"}

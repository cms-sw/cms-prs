It enables the creation of default `cfi` files for all instances of the plugin template `JetConstituentSelector`.\r\n\r\nThis is expected to have no consequences for any existing workflow.\r\n\r\nThe reason to enable the creation of the said `cfi` files is that an external tool used by HLT (i.e. `ConfDB`) relies on the existence of `cfi` files to know the default configuration of CMSSW plugins.\r\n\r\nThanks to @rgerosa for reporting the issue.\r\n\r\nMerely technical. No changes expected.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe new `cfi` files are created as expected.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nN/A", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1645798219", "comments": 12, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1645564022", "deletions": 10, "labels": ["hlt-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "requires-external", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "8fb788ff38553042e5d818d400ea379bedafe9c0", "merged_at": "1645798219", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 37039, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "create `cfi` files for `JetConstituentSelector<>` plugins", "updated_at": "1645798219", "user": "missirol"}

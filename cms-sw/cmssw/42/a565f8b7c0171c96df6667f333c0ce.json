The utility `convertToRaw` does not currently work in `14_0_X` and `14_1_X` without this change. The change is merely technical: none of the values of the existing parameters are changed. A typo in `convertToRaw` is also fixed.\r\n>\r\n> Merely technical. No changes expected.\r\n>\r\n> (It would be good to add a unit test for this utility, but I currently do not have enough time to implement a proper one, and I would not delay this fix.)\r\n\r\nFYI: @fwyzard \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nNone beyond the validation done for #44735.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

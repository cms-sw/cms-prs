If the puppi related input tags are both empty, it disables accessing puppi. If the input tags not empty, the behaviour is identical to before, thereby protecting against simple typos.\r\n\r\nThis is helpful to remake the PFPackedCandidates without running all of miniAOD. The use case which prompts this is the new HEEP V7.0 uses PFPackedCandidates for tracker isolation and therefore needs to produce these in AOD.\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1490258753", "comments": 22, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1480340869", "deletions": 23, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 16778, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Making Puppi optional for PATPackedCandidate producer : 81X", "updated_at": "1490258753", "user": "Sam-Harper"}

If a file written prior to CMSSW_5_0_0 is read in CMSSW_5_0_0 or later, this \"LHC\" process is added retroactively, which affects the process history. The process history must then be retroactively modified.\nThis worked fine until CMSSW_6_2_0, when a bug was introduced. There is a map used to map the old process history to the new. In 6_2_0, the entry for an empty old process history was incorrectly omitted from the map. Real raw data prior to CMSSW_5_0_0 had an empty process history. So, the process history ID for real raw data was not found in the map. and a fatal assert fired.\nThe fix is to simply add the missing entry to the map.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1393407537", "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1392746857", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "b3a531589737742c57487e06405684fddff96946", "merged_at": "1393407537", "merged_by": "nclopezo", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_0_X", "number": 2519, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Don't try to update empty process history ID", "updated_at": "1393472300", "user": "wmtan"}

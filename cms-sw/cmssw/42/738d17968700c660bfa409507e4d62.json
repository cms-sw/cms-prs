Should be `auto const& blocks` to not copy them. Also, somewhere on the way I accidentally removed the destructor for the muon algo, therefore I wrap it into a std::unique_pointer now to fix a memory leak. Also, some other minor tweaks to make up for the mistakes:\r\n\r\n* EDPutToken for pfCleanedCandidates\r\n* Avoid temporary unique pointers to muon output collections \r\n\r\nI meant to amend this to #26813 but it was already signed off, so I didn't want to stop it.\r\nThat's my last PF PR now. @jpata, now it's all yours :)\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles and matrix tests pass.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\n\r\nNo backport intended.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1560103694", "comments": 17, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1558468899", "deletions": 118, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "5340d51755ba9a5c86f252940706195a172efb9f", "merged_at": "1560103694", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 26864, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Follow up on \"Remove PFElectronAlgo and PFPhotonAlgo used back in Run 1\"", "updated_at": "1560103694", "user": "guitargeek"}

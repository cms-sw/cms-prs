Rechits producers are hence adapted and labels are parsed from an extra string in `ESProducer` configuration.\nAutocond list is updated to include new GTs introducing this new and labelled timing calibrations collection.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested for randomised Run 1-2 physics runs with (IOV local) calibration JSON, SQLite file, and `106X_dataRun2_Candidate_2019_04_27_14_01_54` GT candidate.

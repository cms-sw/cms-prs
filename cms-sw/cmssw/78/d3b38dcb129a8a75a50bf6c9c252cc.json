The firmware was deployed On June 6th, the first run with this firmware is 393039. The JIRA is here: https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSLITOPS-511\r\n\r\nThis change in the emulator is required to keep the emulator in line with the firmware. This is not critical for data taking, but it's used in DQM data-emulator comparisons and also in MC production.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nValidated with running on data from before/after run 393039 and also with MC. Works as expected.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nThis will be backported to 15_0_X for data taking and MC production purposes\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 7, "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1750930457", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["l1-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 48423, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[15_1_X] Implementing sector based mode 7 promotion in EMTF for Run 3 2025", "updated_at": "1750930685", "user": "eyigitba"}

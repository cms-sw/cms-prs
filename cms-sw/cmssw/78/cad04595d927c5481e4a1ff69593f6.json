This is carried out in commit e8814acc691cbdd0ee902a0bfef56759cb0d1cda.\r\nI profit of this PR to fix some typos / oddities in commit eaef3cd5ba73b1fa6df2a76433897d328319c75a as well as adding a harvesting step for the `@hltGPUvsCPU` sequence in commit 0e98d607aab30a82cc498629ed3a0aa04b955c1d.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRun successfully: \r\n\r\n`runTheMatrix.py --what gpu -l 17034.402 -t 4 -j 8 --ibeos`\r\n\r\nand checked that the desired output plots are available (see for example [here](https://marcomusich.web.cern.ch/display/DQM_forGPUvsCPU_v2.root)).\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

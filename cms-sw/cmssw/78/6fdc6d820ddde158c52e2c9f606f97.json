This issue was spotted running wfs like 158.1.\r\n\r\nThere was also a trivial change to the name of the cleaned heavy ion genJet module, which had a conflict (affected wf 150, for example).  \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested on wf 150, 158.1 and 158.01.  Please test on the other wfs identified in #31670\r\n\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore submitting your pull requests, make sure you followed this checklist:\r\n- verify that the PR is really intended for the chosen branch\r\n- verify that changes follow [CMS Naming, Coding, And Style Rules](http://cms-sw.github.io/cms_coding_rules.html)\r\n- verify that the PR passes the basic test procedure suggested in the [CMSSW PR instructions](https://cms-sw.github.io/PRWorkflow.html)\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1602007039", "comments": 28, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1601914994", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "requires-external", "tests-approved", "urgent"], "merge_commit_sha": "8d89aa3b104130ef94177f7efa6d2befbdbcbd73", "merged_at": "1602007039", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 31674, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 4, "state": "closed", "title": "Use akCs4PFJets for candidate-based tagInfos for HI workflows", "updated_at": "1602160458", "user": "mandrenguyen"}

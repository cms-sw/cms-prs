This will cause problems when finding the scale/smear corrections and cause an exception to be thrown as it rightly detected an inconsistency. \r\n\r\nThis fix now makes it so the scale and smearing is not run when the energy is nan and default values are returned. This has happened once so far in the AOD. \r\n\r\nIssue reported and discussed here: https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSCOMPPR-3266", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1532621066", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_3_X", "number": 24093, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Protecting E/gamma Scale and Smearing from \"nan\" energies : 103X", "updated_at": "1532637528", "user": "Sam-Harper"}

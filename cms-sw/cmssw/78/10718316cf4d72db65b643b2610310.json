In this context it is not unreasonable to foresee changes in that iteration as well as in the other (high pT triplet iteration) currently in use to build the final HLT tracks collection in the phase-2 menu \r\nSo it would be ideal to monitor both of them at the same time\r\nThis PR provides support for DQM and Validation for `hltInitialStep` and  `hltHighPtTriplet` tracks in the Phase2 HLT menu.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRun the following workflow:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrunTheMatrix.py -l 29834.999 --ibeos\r\n``` \r\n\r\nI observe in the output of the step3 the following additional collections:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ edmEventSize -v -a 29834.999_TTbar_14TeV+Run4D110PU_PMXS1S2PR/step3.root | grep -E 'hltInitial|hltHighPt'\r\nrecoTrackExtras_hltInitialStepTrackSelectionHighPurity__HLT. 38142.7 27737.6\r\nrecoTrackExtras_hltHighPtTripletStepTrackSelectionHighPurity__HLT. 11475 8452.3\r\nrecoTracks_hltInitialStepTrackSelectionHighPurity__HLT. 15124.2 5281.5\r\nTrackingRecHitsOwned_hltInitialStepTrackSelectionHighPurity__HLT. 40521.9 4144.9\r\nrecoTracks_hltHighPtTripletStepTrackSelectionHighPurity__HLT. 4760.4 1833.6\r\nTrackingRecHitsOwned_hltHighPtTripletStepTrackSelectionHighPurity__HLT. 11860.7 1581.2\r\nuchars_hltHighPtTripletStepTrackSelectionHighPurity_QualityMasks_HLT. 307.4 292.9\r\nfloats_hltHighPtTripletStepTrackSelectionHighPurity_MVAValues_HLT. 338.4 286.5\r\nuchars_hltInitialStepTrackSelectionHighPurity_QualityMasks_HLT. 328.7 284.5\r\nfloats_hltInitialStepTrackSelectionHighPurity_MVAValues_HLT. 448.8 278.4\r\n```\r\n\r\nInspecting the output DQM file I see the new plots appearing for the considered collections.\r\nAn example root DQM file that can be obtained with this branch is available [here](https://cernbox.cern.ch/s/D0DhmxwokBsHukl).\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

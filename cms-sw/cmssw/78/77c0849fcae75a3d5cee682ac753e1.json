The properties of the data member are not properties of the containing class, and should not be passed to the TypeWithDict constructor.  This part of the pull request is not ROOT6 specific, and will be fixed in 7_4_X in a separate pull request.\nPlease merge this request as soon as convenient.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_ROOT6_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1419921990", "comments": 1, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1419909728", "deletions": 49, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "core-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "3168b7ec0c94afb421844546911e8cb3f67955cd", "merged_at": "1419921990", "merged_by": "ktf", "number": 7021, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Avoid header parsing for arrays", "updated_at": "1419946826", "user": "wmtan"}

When that effort is complete, the intent is to submit a separate PR deleting that ParameterSet when all module construction is complete.\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses modules in the Reco* subsystems with such a reference.\r\n\r\nThese references were not needed. I just deleted them. In two of the modules, I had to convert code to use the referenced passed in as an argument instead of its copy.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRelies on existing tests.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1691693643", "deletions": 21, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_3_X", "number": 42536, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Remove references to main ParameterSet in Reco* subsystem", "updated_at": "1691694660", "user": "wddgit"}

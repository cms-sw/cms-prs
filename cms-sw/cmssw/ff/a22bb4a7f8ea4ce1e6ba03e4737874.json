The APV shot cleaner additionally subtracts the median digi, which leads to a (usually moderate) loss in charge of the clusters in such (parts of) modules (and a small reduction of the hit efficiency).\r\nFrom the comparisons done by @CesarBernardes the effect was clearly visible in the tails of the digi and cluster distributions, and the tracking efficiency slightly increases with this fix.\r\n\r\nCC: @icali @abaty @CesarBernardes ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1551185005", "comments": 48, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1542288501", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-rejected", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 25246, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Disable the APV shot cleaner for 2018 HI", "updated_at": "1551185005", "user": "pieterdavid"}

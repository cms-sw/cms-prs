This should avoid exceptions if the records are not in the GT. No changes to the outputs are expected.\r\nThe ESProducers for the records are still kept in the default configuration since not all necessary GTs contain the records already.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nPasses limited matrix tests.\r\nRemoves the NoRecord exception if the ESProducers for the records are commented out in the configuration manually and the box SC algorithm is used without dynamic dPhi (Tested by manually changing WF 5.1 configuration).\r\nNone of the limited matrix WFs seems to use the box algo though and no difference is observed in the matrix test results when the ESProducers are removed.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1614474396", "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1614261827", "deletions": 10, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "23331747c70d079ee9b50446cc1b5820ef5afea6", "merged_at": "1614474396", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 32997, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Consume records for mustache SC only if the mustache algo is used", "updated_at": "1614474396", "user": "thomreis"}

The newly saved collection will contain all pfcandidates that should be used to perform physics studies.\r\nThis will only affect PhaseII workflows. I expect no regression and very tiny effect on the event size of the final ROOT file.\r\n\r\nAlso, electrons built within the HGCAL volume were not saved into the particleFlow pfCandidate collection, causing strange effects (artificial MET, missing JETs etc...). Now they are forced into the final collection.\r\n\r\n@malgeri, @cseez, @felicepantaleo @kpedro88 \r\n\r\nBackport of #20614", "branch": "CMSSW_9_3_X", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1506594351", "comments": 28, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1505997763", "deletions": 81, "labels": ["backport-ok", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "8270be8711187fc558edb1b0c906fcce35f520fd", "merged_at": "1506594351", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_3_X", "number": 20615, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add electrons from HGCAL in the pfCandidate collection", "updated_at": "1506594351", "user": "rovere"}

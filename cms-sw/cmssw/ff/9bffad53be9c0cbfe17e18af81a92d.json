This should fix a set of static analyzer warnings reported in #33349 tests.\r\nThe module has probably not been used since its migration to being a one::EDAnalyzer because it was actually broken and did not print anything. This was fixed by adding `edm::one::WatchRuns`.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested by running `SimCalorimetry/EcalTrigPrimProducers/test/readDBTPConds_GlobalTag_cfg.py`.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1618583249", "comments": 6, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1618405570", "deletions": 346, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "8b8cfcde0392e448704909df6c97a695fb53b21c", "merged_at": "1618583249", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "number": 33431, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Migrate EcalTPCondAnalyzer to use esConsumes", "updated_at": "1618583249", "user": "thomreis"}

As these\nnever were selected -- remove. Enabling them in 6 packages with a\ncorrected name would create duplicate types in dictionaries.\n\nThe following types:\n- `edm::RefVector<edm::AssociationMap*`\n- `edm::RefProd<edm::AssociationMap*`\n- `edm::Ref<edm::AssociationMap*`\n\ndo not exist in `DataFormats/RecoCandidate` and `DataFormats/TrackReco`\ndictionary translation units. Similar rules exist in\n`DataFormats/TrackCandidate`, but in this package `genreflex` does select\nthem.\n\nDue to regression in ROOT6 `genreflex` these warnings are temporarely\nnon fatal. CMS makes `genreflex` to fail on any warning by default. This\nis already fixed in ROOT6 master branch.\n\nWould be happy if a second pair of eyes would double check.\n\n@wmtan \n\nSigned-off-by: David Abdurachmanov David.Abdurachmanov@cern.ch\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1433788994", "comments": 4, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1433752298", "deletions": 13, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "ffb932ed79ae29c79d0590a792415d7c3a4b7aac", "merged_at": "1433788994", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 9492, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Clean unsused selection rules (ROOT 6.04.00)", "updated_at": "1433788995", "user": "davidlt"}

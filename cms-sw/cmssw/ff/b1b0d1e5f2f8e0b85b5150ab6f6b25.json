While for the current code, without \"delta\" present in the index, it's actually going from 0 to 7, missing the last TS, which results in some weird behavior in the fitting for the +4BX. After this fix, this behavior's gone. \r\nDetails can be viewed in slides: [https://indico.cern.ch/event/839463/contributions/3521507/attachments/1892056/3120549/Wired_Behavior_of_Mahi_at_4BX.pdf](https://indico.cern.ch/event/839463/contributions/3521507/attachments/1892056/3120549/Wired_Behavior_of_Mahi_at_4BX.pdf)\r\nAnd the check of the impact on jets and MET are:  [https://indico.cern.ch/event/839463/contributions/3521507/attachments/1892056/3125214/20190812_Jae_NoMtg_4BXImpact.pdf](https://indico.cern.ch/event/839463/contributions/3521507/attachments/1892056/3125214/20190812_Jae_NoMtg_4BXImpact.pdf)\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nBasic tests are performed and all succeed.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1568137984", "comments": 16, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1567812006", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "fa21142d73a47fc45ec296d0db8e3e50cc93c1f2", "merged_at": "1568137984", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27950, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "HBHE: bugfix for MAHI on issue of missing SOI+4 subtraction", "updated_at": "1568137984", "user": "hmiaozh"}

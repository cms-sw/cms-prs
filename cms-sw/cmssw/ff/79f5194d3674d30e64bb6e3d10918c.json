The reason for this cut is to remove fake jets which arise from low-pt (very-curved) tracks attached to high pt ecal clusters. Theses \"electrons\" are then included in jets, but since the track is very curved the ecal cluster is not actually inside the jet.\nPlease see motivation slides here:\nhttps://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/pub/CMS/PhotonAnalyses2015/20150825_fakerate.pdf\nAdditional documentation can be provided on request.\n\nAdditionally, this PR includes two additions to the Heavy Ion Event Content for electron-related quantities.\n\nThis PR should not affect pp workflows in any way.\nMatrices 5.1 and 140.53 worked locally for me.\n\nThis will also be backported to 7_5_X.\n\nThis PR supersedes @doanhien PRs #11193 and #11191, both of those should be closed.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1442118974", "comments": 9, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1441887430", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "1d20391af3687b9b13563226aec0f574bc6b0000", "merged_at": "1442118974", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 11223, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "HeavyIon: Add E/p cut to electrons and extend event content for electron collections.", "updated_at": "1442118974", "user": "richard-cms"}

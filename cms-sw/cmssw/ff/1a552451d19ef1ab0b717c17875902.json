This PR patches the logic to explicitly handle the FastSim-specific seed producer.\r\n\r\nMore details (copied from https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/20879#issuecomment-343491440)\r\n\r\n> The affected code is here\r\n> https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/62cb420784a32cbbba120519d49881c752d25ea2/Validation/RecoTrack/python/TrackValidation_cff.py#L194-L202\r\n> Now the `<iteration name>Seeds` module in `iterativeTk_cff.py` is changed with `fastsim` modifier and therefore both of the `if` branches fail leading to `continue`. Except for initialStepPreSplitting and jetCoreRegionalStep which are not used in FastSim and the seeding module is not replaced (and therefore the code above is able to extract layer lists from there).\r\n\r\nTested in CMSSW_10_0_X_2017-11-09-2300, expecting more seeding layers in the MTV histograms vs. seeding layers in FastSim workflows.\r\n\r\n@akapoorcern @angirar @slava77 @Dr15Jones ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1510684776", "comments": 12, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1510342992", "deletions": 7, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "df6512b70ea2b389c07560c7e6a38c6fc393b68f", "merged_at": "1510684776", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_0_X", "number": 21276, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix MultiTrackValidator seeding layers configuration for FastSim", "updated_at": "1510684776", "user": "makortel"}

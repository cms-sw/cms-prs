The problem did not affect existing configurations (with geometry coming from xml), and the fix was regression-tested.\n\nThis fix is needed to be able to finally switch to reading MF geometry and configuration from DB, which will happen in a future (pre)release once a GT with all required payloads becomes available.\n\nThis is the same as #6514, but for CMSSW_7_4_X. Will be merged automatically since the former is fully signed.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 10, "closed_at": "1416981326", "comments": 1, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1416981271", "deletions": 48, "labels": ["alca-pending", "comparison-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "4adc68e1a7486aa2203a4b3670da10a7b3464833", "merged_at": "1416981326", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 6602, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Prepare for taking MF configurations from DB", "updated_at": "1416981326", "user": "ktf"}

Under certain conditions, this can lead to invalid configs, as recently reported by a user.\r\n\r\nThe update here tries to make the removal a bit more robust, adding to the `process` only the objects that are used by the sequence `SimL1Emulator` (which, I think, is all HLT ultimately uses).\r\n\r\nStill, I ended up keeping the list of \"manual removals\" due to one L1T `ESProducer`. Hopefully, this can be improved in the future.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nValidated with the following test:\r\n```bash\r\nhltGetConfiguration /dev/CMSSW_12_2_0/GRun --globaltag auto:run3_hlt  --data --unprescale \\\r\n --input /store/data/Run2018D/EphemeralHLTPhysics1/RAW/v1/000/323/775/00000/2E066536-5CF2-B340-A73B-209640F29FF6.root \\\r\n --customise HLTrigger/Configuration/customizeHLTforCMSSW.customiseFor2018Input --l1-emulator uGT > hlt.py\r\n(edmConfigDump hlt.py | grep -v 'L1T WARN: ') > hlt_dump.py\r\n(edmConfigDump hlt.py | grep -v 'L1T WARN: ') > hlt_dump_pruned.py\r\n```\r\n * `hlt.py` works both before and after the PR\r\n * `python3 hlt_dump.py` does not work without the PR; after the PR, `cmsRun hlt_dump.py` works, and `hlt_dump.py` does not contain unnecessary L1T modules/sequences/tasks (e.g. L1T Phase-2 objects)\r\n * `hlt_dump_pruned.py` (the final pruned version of the full configuration) is unchanged by this PR (modulo one module which is kept on a `Task` instead being put directly on a Path, b/c `L1REPACK` deletes that particular Task manually without the PR)\r\n\r\n*Note* : the `grep` bit is an hack to avoid 2 printouts from L1T that make their way into the stdout of `edmConfigDump`.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nN/A", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 0, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1637258385", "deletions": 48, "labels": ["hlt-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_2_X", "number": 36173, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "improve robustness of a HLT customisation used for L1T re-emulation", "updated_at": "1637258429", "user": "missirol"}

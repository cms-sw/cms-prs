Full description of the original PR is repeated below for convenience.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds links between taus and tracks used to build their charged hadron candidates, but not contained by PF-particles. The links are added at both RECO/AOD and MiniAOD levels.\r\n\r\nAt RECO/AOD level the link is created by a dedicated \"modifier\" plugin which adds to a tau object edm::Ptrs to members of (general)track collection, while at miniAOD level it is done via modified PATTauSlimmer module which stores in tau object edm::Ptrs to members of lostTracks collection. In both cases already existing data members of respectively reco::BaseTau and pat::Tau objects are reused. Linking at RECO/AOD is needed to produce link at miniAOD.\r\n\r\nExpected changes: small number of taus (<1%) will contain up to 2 additional edm::Ptrs. Other tau features will stay unchanged.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nStandard tests, i.e. `runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos`, passed successfully.\r\n\r\nResults of other tests like increase of size/CPU/memory usage provided within the original PR. \r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nBackport of #37918.\r\n\r\nNeeded as thanks to it miniAOD user has access to all charged prongs of reconstructed taus.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "changed_files": 9, "comments": 2, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1652796662", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 37986, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "link lost tracks to taus [12_4_X]", "updated_at": "1652850000", "user": "mbluj"}

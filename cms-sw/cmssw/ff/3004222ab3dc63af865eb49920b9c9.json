Running a trivial RECO workflow did succeed.\r\n\r\nNOTE: this should be a purely technical change and is not expected to change results for the cases we use.\r\n\r\nThis WILL change behavior IF an old version is used, but it returns the code to the behavior it had before the bug was introduced at the time this code was updated to call `consumes`.\r\n\r\nfixes #46866", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 14, "comments": 19, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1733327307", "deletions": 580, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_0_X", "number": 46868, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Improve ElectronIDExternalProducer", "updated_at": "1733512854", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

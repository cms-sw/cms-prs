The first thing I realized was that a big chunk of the PixelHitMatcher is obsolete, as indicated by this over 6 years old comment [2]. This includes so much code that it's probably a good to have a PR that removes this code before thinking of any other changes.\r\n\r\nAs a little side effect, I moved the related ElectronSeedProducer plugin into a single cc file and (more unrelated) moved the only remaining class from EgammaElectronProducers/interface to the plugins directory because only the plugins depend on this class and therefore a separate EgammaElectronProducers library is not needed.\r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/28039#discussion_r329598269\r\n[2] https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/RecoEgamma/EgammaElectronAlgos/src/PixelHitMatcher.cc#L249\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles, local matrix tests pass.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\n\r\nNo backport intended.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 15, "closed_at": "1571248953", "comments": 21, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1570604918", "deletions": 969, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "da923f4d3a937b263681d452998837e39765109d", "merged_at": "1571248953", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 28133, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 6, "state": "closed", "title": "Cleanup obsolete part from Egamma PixelHitMatcher class ", "updated_at": "1571248953", "user": "guitargeek"}

The flag is deprecated and has been unsupported by JME for a while now. The recommendation for analyzers ([twiki](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/CMS/MissingETOptionalFiltersRun2)) is to apply the individual noise filter flags. Removing the `Flag_METFilters` flag avoids accidental usage by analyzers with the next MiniAOD and NanoAOD production.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n- passes the usual runTheMatrix test: `runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos`\r\n- ran workflow `25202.0_TTbar_13`  and had checked that the `Flag_METFilters` branch is not in NanoAOD anymore\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 11, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1724398846", "deletions": 34, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved", "xpog-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 45781, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[MiniAOD] Remove Flag_METFilters from MiniAOD", "updated_at": "1724655232", "user": "nurfikri89"}

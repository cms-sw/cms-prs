I'm sorry for figuring it out just after the other PR got merged.\r\nIn the currently planned scenario (10bit hybridZS data taking, 8bit repacking in the HLT), the following happens: for the \"non-flagged\" APVs (without modified baseline), baseline subtraction and zero-suppression are performed, and digis saved with 10bit precision (in the emulation as well as in the FED firmware). When running the remaining zero-suppression in software afterwards, the \"flagged\" APVs are zero-suppressed and their digis brought in the range 0-255 ([255,1022]-> 254, 1023->255), and repacked in the 8bit ZS raw format.\r\nThe problem is that for the non-flagged APVs the 10bit digis were simply [copied](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/998183e58ab4280b63f4cee3059eaae407d89147/RecoLocalTracker/SiStripZeroSuppression/src/SiStripRawProcessingAlgorithms.cc#L82), but the packer [assumes](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/998183e58ab4280b63f4cee3059eaae407d89147/EventFilter/SiStripRawToDigi/plugins/SiStripDigiToRaw.cc#L112) they are also already 8bit-truncated and simply discards the two most significant bits (so `adc % 256` instead of 254 (or 255)). Therefore, clusters with adc>255 strips got a lower total charge or were split.\r\n\r\nThe following plots show the number of digis and clusters, and cluster charge and width, in the hybrid zero-suppressed scenario (red) compared to standard zero-suppression with `process.siStripZeroSuppression.Algorithms.CommonModeNoiseSubtractionMode = \"Median\"` (black) to maximally align the zero-suppression settings, to be compared with those in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/24597#issuecomment-423974148 .\r\n![plotdigistatdiff_ndigis](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8883677/46012895-e011f480-c0ca-11e8-80cf-c968aed4035a.png)\r\n![plotclusterstatdiff_nclus](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8883677/46012920-ee601080-c0ca-11e8-9931-7c042383e6c4.png)\r\n![plotclusterstatdiff_cluswidth](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8883677/46012927-f4ee8800-c0ca-11e8-81b9-6741b1d4bcd8.png)\r\n![plotclusterstatdiff_cluscharge](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8883677/46012930-f6b84b80-c0ca-11e8-947a-d5ddd434e8b7.png)\r\n\r\nCC: @icali @CesarBernardes @erikbutz @mmusich @echabert ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1537901015", "comments": 19, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1537870149", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["bug-fix", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "76080f54f22460009ce7ec9fbf8451ab9e6082e3", "merged_at": "1537901015", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_3_X", "number": 24654, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Bug fix: truncate when copying digis in hybrid zero-suppression", "updated_at": "1537901016", "user": "pieterdavid"}

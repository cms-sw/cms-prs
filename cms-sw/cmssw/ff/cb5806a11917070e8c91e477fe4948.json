This PR fixes the issue by retrieving the puppi weights from the `ValueMap<float>` produced by `packedpuppi`.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n- Checked that the pT of the AK8 jets calculated from the four-vector sum of PFCand is now consistent with the pT from the AK8 jets four-vector.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"500\" height=\"210.02\" alt=\"pfCandValid\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/868d9389-157c-43b9-8464-629c1756e35c\" />\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

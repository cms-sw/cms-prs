The deletion of the outdated correction file in cms-data/EgammaAnalysis-ElectronTools#12 and #46138 caused the IB test failures as the default energy correction file is the legacy one when there is no modifier.\r\n\r\n(the master is okay since the legacy workflows were cleaned up in #45240)\r\n\r\nSo I cherry-picked one of the line changes in #45240 - this should make the default energy correction file the UL version when there is no modifier.\r\n\r\nFix https://github.com/cms-data/EgammaAnalysis-ElectronTools/pull/12#issuecomment-2454167466 and https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/46138#issuecomment-2454179806", "branch": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 4, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1730715567", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-rejected", "orp-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 46595, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Fix IB test failures due to missing outdated energy correction files", "updated_at": "1730729123", "user": "SanghyunKo"}

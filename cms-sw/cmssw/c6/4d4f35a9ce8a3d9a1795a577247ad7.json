The \"Phase1PU70\" tracking can still be run with `Run2_2017_trackingPhase1PU70` era, and there should be no changes in it (i.e. `Run2_2017_trackingPhase1PU70` with this PR should give the same tracks as `Run2_2017` without this PR).\n\nTested in CMSSW_8_1_X_2016-03-15-1100. There should be no changes in <= 2016 workflows, but in 2017 workflows changes are expected in all(?) track-related variables.\n\nabout all track-related will change in 2017 workflows.\n\n@rovere @VinInn \n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 33, "closed_at": "1458664372", "comments": 23, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1458111318", "deletions": 238, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "62af7b1238fbc974a8a838063f8386c93f125d96", "merged_at": "1458664372", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 13736, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 8, "state": "closed", "title": "Introduce new tracking sequence for phase1 (2017)", "updated_at": "1476957180", "user": "makortel"}

It adds the new sexaquark particles, the inelastic interaction, the neutron annihilation, and a looping mechanism to increase the chance of an interaction, plus other necessary classes and files. CustomPhysicsList is extended to this new interaction for the anti-sexaquark.\r\n\r\nNothing in ordinary CMS running should be affected, GEANT will only use this code when a particle with pdgId -1020000020 is found (which is the proper code for a sexaquark of content uuddss).\r\n\r\nThis code integration happens following the presentation in the EXO MC&I meeting here:\r\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/1379001/#3-sexaquark-simulation-in-cmss\r\nWe were requested to integrate the sexaquark simulation code, and to validate our private productions with a central simulation. For the latter, we will want to do a backport to CMSSW_10_2_X once merged in the master.\r\n\r\nThe code was tested in the latest 14_1_X integration build using the new python config added in the CustomPhysics/test directory.\r\nThis was not expected to affect any runTheMatrix tests. I ran the tests for completeness (runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos) which flagged no problems.\r\n\r\n+CC @vetens\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 23, "comments": 8, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1715899555", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["simulation-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 44992, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 20, "state": "open", "title": "Integration of sexaquark simulation code (for EXO-24-003)", "updated_at": "1716704884", "user": "lowette"}

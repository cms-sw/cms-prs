In the meanwhile it is important to point the reconstruction to the xml geometry. A working example is available [here](https://github.com/CTPPS/cmssw/tree/totemTiming_rechitProducer_PR/RecoCTPPS/TotemRPLocal/test/totemTiming_reco_cfg.py).\r\n- With previous hardware configuration, only 2/3 of the detector is connected. The rest will be connected during TS1.\r\n- Suggested run with good statistics: 314276.\r\n\r\nNEXT IN LINE:\r\n- fine tuning of the CFD parameters: the parameters in this PR were chosen doing a scan, however a small tuning could be required in the future.\r\n- check cabling (on going).\r\n- DQM (almost ready).\r\n- add SAMPIC calibration: [TotemTimingConversions](https://github.com/CTPPS/cmssw/tree/totemTiming_rechitProducer_PR/RecoCTPPS/TotemRPLocal/interface/TotemTimingConversions.h) was designed to be extensible to read \r\ncalibration values without changing the rest of the code. We aspect a small difference on the performance, tests still on going.\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your review!\r\n@forthommel \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 29, "comments": 42, "commits": 27, "created_at": "1525163060", "deletions": 144, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "geometry-pending", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-started"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 23101, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Totem Timing RecHit Producer", "updated_at": "1525415318", "user": "nminafra"}

It consists of two modifications compared to the Run-2 baseline:  \r\n* fixed strips (pi-zero candidates) a la Run-1 which protect against \"fat strips\" due to PU photons,\r\n* tighter dz cut for charged isolation (0.2->0.1) to maintain its efficiency at high-PU.\r\n\r\nThe modifications do not affect standard workflows, while for Phase2 ones at high-PU a lower number of fake-taus (with e.g. QCD, ttbar samples) esp. at lower-Pt is expected. \r\n\r\nSome further details in slides here:  \r\n* https://indico.cern.ch/event/650324/contributions/2645287/attachments/1485227/2305885/mbluj_TauId_Phase2_fixed_strip_27June2017.pdf \r\n* https://indico.cern.ch/event/652731/contributions/2656795/attachments/1492042/2319888/mbluj_TauId_Phase2_WPproposal_12July2017.pdf\r\n\r\nBackport to 92X and 91X will follow shortly.\r\n ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1501076191", "comments": 15, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1500368334", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "d489da06f3b31758533592aae90d0c2d28510c83", "merged_at": "1501076191", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_3_X", "number": 19788, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Tau customization for Phase2", "updated_at": "1501076192", "user": "mbluj"}

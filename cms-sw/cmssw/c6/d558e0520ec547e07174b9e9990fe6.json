I also completed an additional (needed) change to FastjetJetProducer.cc as it's previous setup was to use grooming techniques if any of the parameters are _present_ without regard to their value. For instance, if one specified useTrimming = cms.bool(False), the fastjet producer was written in such a way that it would in fact still use Trimming. This change is necessary so that all of the grooming parameters can be present in the cfi.py file without causing all instances of fastjet producers to use them. As a last note, the values set for grooming parameters are equal to the defaults used by fastjet in the absence of grooming -> there should be no effect with older config files which do not use these parameters.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_2_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1406002284", "comments": 6, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1405704262", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "ebd4469af199fd29c982bde73662702a9a85ace7", "merged_at": "1406002284", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_2_X", "number": 4705, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "Feature/add parameters for fast jet", "updated_at": "1406525697", "user": "clint-richardson"}

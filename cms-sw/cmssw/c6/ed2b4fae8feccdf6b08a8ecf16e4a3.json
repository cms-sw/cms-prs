The legacy code used to perform the extrapolation in Run-1 has been replaced with the current one used in the L1 ntuple generation. In addition, the pT thresholds of the tag and the probe muons have been updated to the 2018 values.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 5, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1537180003", "deletions": 114, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "dqm-pending", "l1-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-started"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_3_X", "number": 24561, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "OfflineDQM: Offline muon DQM with coordinates extrapolated to the muon system CMSLITDPG-729", "updated_at": "1537180563", "user": "stahlleiton"}

This should represent all 2022 and 2023 caloParams.\r\n\r\n@bundocka let me know if this works for you. I am trying to port the minimum necessary calo params files. If additional are needed, let me know and I'll pull them over.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nSimple port of existing test files from l1t offline fork. Is not involved in extant workflows.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

This PR would add a variety of new performance improvements in jet flavor classification, jet energy regression, and tau ID and reconstruction that are important additions to include for Run-3 analyses. For many more details, please refer to the original PR. The code changes from the PR itself should be identical to those just merged in the master branch. \r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "changed_files": 19, "comments": 5, "commits": 24, "created_at": "1680587441", "deletions": 64, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "requires-external", "xpog-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "number": 41265, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Backport to CMSSW_13_0_X of new extended ParticleNet networks for jet classification, regression, and taus", "updated_at": "1680593003", "user": "scooperstein"}

This PR would add a variety of new performance improvements in jet flavor classification, jet energy regression, and tau ID and reconstruction that are important additions to include for Run-3 analyses. For many more details, please refer to the original PR. The code changes from the PR itself should be identical to those just merged in the master branch. \r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "changed_files": 19, "closed_at": "1681322857", "comments": 25, "commits": 24, "created_at": "1680587441", "deletions": 64, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "requires-external", "backport-ok", "xpog-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "ef634476274ed1d96ef11254f5745777499f43f2", "merged_at": "1681322857", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "number": 41265, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Backport to CMSSW_13_0_X of new extended ParticleNet networks for jet classification, regression, and taus", "updated_at": "1681322857", "user": "scooperstein"}

However this performance improvement is not enough alone. More work would be needed to remove all the places in the code where things like `myTrack->ptError()/mytrack->pt()` are used (e.g. in pf muon reco) by implementing a method such as `ptErrorOverPt()` to avoid more divisions and sqrts.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1601445603", "comments": 65, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1599820336", "deletions": 17, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "5fce31fe3018bbba0cbd6d9823de8805d456a8a6", "merged_at": "1601445603", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 31433, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 5, "state": "closed", "title": "TrackBase: Reduce number of operations such as divisions, sqrts and multiplications", "updated_at": "1601445603", "user": "dpiparo"}

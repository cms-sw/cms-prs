I'll comment again as soon as I've re-run my validation on it which will take a few hours. The 74X and 75X are ready to go and I'll submit those pull requests as soon as I have validated the changes (and that it completely fixes the memory issue). \n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1438687957", "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1438608285", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "hlt-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "db4790d676bb6e64fad217eee75e2dd8d9aa0fad", "merged_at": "1438687957", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 10530, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "fixing memory leak in EgammaHLTNxNClusterProducer :76X", "updated_at": "1438687957", "user": "Sam-Harper"}

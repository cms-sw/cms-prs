We missed this code when\r\nthose get methods were removed.\r\n\r\nNote the ES module labels are now validated in another\r\nway, so the deleted validate functions are no longer used.\r\n\r\nAlso deleted an unused function argument. Also reviewed\r\nheader includes in the files that were modified and there\r\nwas a side effect that we uncovered a missing include in\r\na file in RecoLuminosity.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis is mostly deletions. There is no new functionality.\r\nThis relies on existing unit tests. The fact that there are\r\nno compilation failures verifies this is unused code.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 10, "closed_at": "1677588391", "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1676931031", "deletions": 192, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "core-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "816a0b5712dbe769f66b87d479687fc1442c26fe", "merged_at": "1677588391", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_13_1_X", "number": 40830, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Delete unused code related to EventSetup", "updated_at": "1677588391", "user": "wddgit"}

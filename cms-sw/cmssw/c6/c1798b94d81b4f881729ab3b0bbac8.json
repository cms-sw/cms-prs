Got the expected results.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1606317939", "comments": 12, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1606233116", "deletions": 37, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "1bc74381d17786f3a9b979ee60ccee1bce1dae27", "merged_at": "1606317939", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 32262, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix Muon and RegionalMuonCand (un)packers", "updated_at": "1606317940", "user": "dinyar"}

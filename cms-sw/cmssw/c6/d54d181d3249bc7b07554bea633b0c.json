[1]\r\n   * Remove old corrections no longer supported by EGM (parametrized correction, 50ns correction, ...)\r\n   * Small changes in the code to comply with CMS coding rules\r\n\r\n@perrotta and @slava77 : the code as it is will **not** pass validation because the tags consumed are not in the GT. The request to include in the global tag have been done [2]. I guess @arunhep or @franzoni will also have to point the \"auto\" GT to the ones with these tags before this code has any hope of passing validation (similar to discussions in [3])\r\n\r\nAttention: @jainshilpi @fcouderc @Sam-Harper @arunhep @franzoni \r\n\r\n[1] https://indico.cern.ch/event/646805/contributions/2627253/attachments/1477404/2289247/status_regression_15june.pdf\r\n[2] https://hypernews.cern.ch/HyperNews/CMS/get/calibrations/3008.html\r\n[3] https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/18912", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 12, "closed_at": "1499088681", "comments": 140, "commits": 16, "created_at": "1497779112", "deletions": 265, "labels": ["alca-pending", "comparison-available", "hold", "l1-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "514d35ac2f219ae16cb0f5f99a68bd71de6dd0d9", "merged_at": "1499088681", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_3_X", "number": 19307, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 34, "state": "closed", "title": "ECAL PFCluster Correction 9X", "updated_at": "1499097370", "user": "rafaellopesdesa"}

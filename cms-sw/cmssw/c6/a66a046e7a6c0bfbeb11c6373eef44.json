It supersedes #17052. It was developed on top of `CMSSW_9_0_X_2017-01-15-2300`.\r\n\r\n856a5b08697fec72112a7e9ec5ec2bc6b05b4336 applies several TEMPORARY changes to make the 2017 workflow continue to run:\r\n* customise function to use hardcode conditions for HCAL and skip packing/unpacking (due to lack of appropriate conditions for this geometry, including emap)\r\n* use of XML geometry instead of database (updated 2017 geom not yet in DB tag)\r\n\r\nOther notable changes in this PR:\r\n* HBHEPhase1Reconstructor will still be used for 2017, even though we only plan to have HPDs - better/more maintainable code, already validated in DPG\r\n* The \"TestNumbering\" setting is now enabled for 2017 onward - this allows the reuse of GEN-SIM when HB or HE topology (=depth segmentation) is changed, by storing SimHits per-layer instead of per-depth\r\n* 2018 workflow introduced to keep the Phase1 HE alive for local HCAL studies (didn't bother to duplicate all the extra cosmic/tracker/etc. workflow variations, they can be added if someone needs them)\r\n\r\nMy intention is that @ianna and @abdoulline + AlCa contacts will make new tags for changed HCAL conditions and geometry records (for *both* 2017 and 2018 = clone of current 2017), and then I can update `autoCond.py` in this PR for final tests. Therefore, I will put the PR on hold once submitted so it will not be merged without these necessary pieces.\r\n\r\nThis PR will be backported to 81X, but #16874 needs to be merged first or HCAL validation will not be able to handle the TestNumbering SimHits.", "branch": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "changed_files": 27, "closed_at": "1485676802", "comments": 79, "commits": 15, "created_at": "1484697157", "deletions": 39, "labels": ["alca-approved", "comparison-available", "db-approved", "dqm-pending", "geometry-approved", "operations-approved", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "6d31c260750485e16f9bd1b14a02a08e1df8aaa1", "merged_at": "1485676802", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "number": 17198, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "Phase0 HE in 2017, Phase1 HE in 2018", "updated_at": "1485850961", "user": "kpedro88"}

After the initial PR review, the choice made was to port these functions under `Heterogeneous/AlpakaMath`. The function logic is as close as possible to the non-alpaka equivalent `DataFormats/Math/interface/deltaPhi.h` file.\r\n\r\nThis PR only introduces the new function to CMSSW + the relevant unit tests. A follow-up PR will be made to actually use these functions in the LST algorithm and delete the LST-specific implementations.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1737390451", "comments": 42, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1735816236", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved", "heterogeneous-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "a168eac642554ab7b532b4102aa927429fea1fa8", "merged_at": "1737390451", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_15_0_X", "number": 47033, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 27, "state": "closed", "title": "Port generic alpaka phi functions to `DataFormats/Math`", "updated_at": "1737390452", "user": "VourMa"}

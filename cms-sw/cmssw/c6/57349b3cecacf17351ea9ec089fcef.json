After the initial PR review, the choice made was to port these functions under `Heterogeneous/AlpakaMath`. The function logic is as close as possible to the non-alpaka equivalent `DataFormats/Math/interface/deltaPhi.h` file.\r\n\r\nThis PR only introduces the new function to CMSSW + the relevant unit tests. A follow-up PR will be made to actually use these functions in the LST algorithm and delete the LST-specific implementations.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 17, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1735816236", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "new-package-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_0_X", "number": 47033, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 12, "state": "open", "title": "Port generic alpaka phi functions to `DataFormats/Math`", "updated_at": "1736364514", "user": "VourMa"}

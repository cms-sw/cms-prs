This was needed in order to correct a previous issue where there were a good number of hits outside their angle space and lead to poor resolution.\r\nResults validating these condition changes were shown at the phase 2 simulation meeting [here](https://indico.cern.ch/event/949829/contributions/4116024/attachments/2147562/3620113/2020_11_20_Test_new_CPE.pdf)\r\n\r\nIt also has an update to the Phase 2 ntuple maker used in validation studies. This update saves more information about the track the hits belong to and the local angles used in the hit reconstruction. Because the ntuple maker now requires the trajectory as an input configuration files that use it must be changed, the example configuration file in the same directory has been updated to reflect this. \r\n\r\n@mmusich @tsusa @emiglior @mtosi @tvami @pmaksim1  @jalimena @perrotta @slava77\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1607961112", "comments": 66, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1605897418", "deletions": 246, "labels": ["alca-approved", "bug-fix", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "db-pending", "geometry-approved", "orp-approved", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "f92c5e69938cb315b0c0a8a0cba280ae23b84de3", "merged_at": "1607961112", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 32220, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 33, "state": "closed", "title": "Phase2 improved conditions and ntuple maker update", "updated_at": "1607961112", "user": "OzAmram"}

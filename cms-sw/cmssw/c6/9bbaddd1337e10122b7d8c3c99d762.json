This PR experiments what will happen if all of them would be removed.\r\n\r\nWhile doing this I encountered several dictionaries on std-only types in various packages that should be in `DataFormats/StdDictionaries` or `DataFormats/WrappedStdDictionaries`, so I took the opportunity to move them in the right place.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nNone\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

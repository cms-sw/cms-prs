For normal undamaged clusters, the 2D fit is as good or better as the usual combination of two 1D fits of cluster projections onto the local x and y axes.  However, the 2D fit is able to fit even clusters that are damaged by (a) edge of sensor, or (b) dead double-column or ROC next door.  The 2D pixel reco is done within a new CPE, called PixelCPEClusterRepair (since it can \"repair\" damaged clusters), which subsumes the default reconstruction, and can perform it as well, and then optionally (if the 2* 1D reco recommends based on its fit outputs) do the 2D fit.  \r\n\r\nAll this code is by default TURNED OFF.  We want it in the release though to simplify testing and enable future development in the near term.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 35, "closed_at": "1522864233", "comments": 267, "commits": 13, "created_at": "1520252245", "deletions": 983, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "db-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "7621d22998d37b4456f2f3a22d2515190709ccce", "merged_at": "1522864233", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 22458, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 126, "state": "closed", "title": "Pixel 3d reco with cluster repair 10 1 x", "updated_at": "1522864233", "user": "pmaksim1"}

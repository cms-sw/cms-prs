This was tracked down to a memory leak due to undeleted raw pointer in GenParticles2HepMCConverter. This PR fixes that by switching to `unique_ptr`.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested with NANO matrix test and see much lower and stable memory usage after the fix.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1727889344", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["generators-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_2_X", "number": 46203, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Fix memory leak in GenParticles2HepMCConverter", "updated_at": "1727889367", "user": "hqucms"}

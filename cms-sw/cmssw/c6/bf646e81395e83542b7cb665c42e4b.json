The function acceleratorsTypes() will return a container holding enumeration values. Currently it will always be empty or contain a value for \"GPU\" if any item in \"@selected_accelerators\" starts with the substring \"gpu-\". We expect addition possible enumeration values may be added in the future.\r\n\r\nThe following additional functions are added:\r\n\r\n- cpuModels()\r\n- gpuModels()\r\n- nvidiaDriverVersion()\r\n- cudaDriverVersion()\r\n- cudaRuntimeVersion()\r\n- cpuModelsFormatted()\r\n- cpuAverageSpeed()\r\n\r\nThe service contains data members to hold the data returned by those functions. Other services (CPU and CUDAService) must be configured for these to be filled. We expect other accelerator devices may be added to this in the future.\r\n\r\nThis does not include changes for anything to get information out of ResourceInformationService. Those changes will come in a future PR.\r\n\r\nThis also does not include changes to store this information persistently. That will also come in a future PR.\r\n\r\nIf the service has its verbose parameter set true, then it will print out some information at begin job.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThere is a unit test that checks the information printed out when the service is set to be verbose. Nothing uses this service yet so I do not expect this will have any immediate effect on RelVals or production executables.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 29, "comments": 40, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1651780468", "deletions": 53, "labels": ["core-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "heterogeneous-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "number": 37831, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 4, "state": "open", "title": "Implement ResourceInformationService", "updated_at": "1670266374", "user": "wddgit"}

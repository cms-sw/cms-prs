If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nNot a backport, but will likely need one for this to have an effect for the upcoming data taking in 140x.\r\n\r\nFY @elfontan @kelmorab @eyigitba  @slaurila  @aloeliger @epalencia ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1712387645", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "xpog-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 44642, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Add L1 objects into Run3Scouting Nano", "updated_at": "1712388223", "user": "artlbv"}

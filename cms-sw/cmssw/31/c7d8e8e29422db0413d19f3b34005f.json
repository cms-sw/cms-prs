Copy-and-pasting the text of that PR : \n\nThis PR contains a large number of JME developments for 73x :\n\nUpdates to use new fastjet 3.1.0 (cms-externals/fastjet#8)\nUpdates to new API for n-subjettiness for fastjet-contrib 1.014 (cms-externals/fastjet-contrib#2)\nAdded changes to PUPPI from the code review here (#5500)\nAdded several new tools, none of which are to be executed in RECO until further notice :\nConstituent subtraction\nSoftKiller\nSoftDrop\nPUPPI\nTwo notes :\n\nThere is a new package, CommonTools/PileupModules. It would aid development to have these separate from CommonTools/ParticleFlow (which is focused on the \"top projection\" code).\nThe current output is set up as an intermediate stage where PFCandidates are produced along with a valueMap of four vectors. This is a stand-in until I make a migration to the ThinnedCollection, but this is better treated together rather than piecemeal.\n\nAlso adding @violatingcp and @nhanvtran to watch this.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_3_X", "changed_files": 34, "closed_at": "1416586543", "comments": 28, "commits": 17, "created_at": "1416424798", "deletions": 72, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "new-package-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_3_X", "number": 6496, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 37, "state": "closed", "title": "Major JME developments for 73x, Redux", "updated_at": "1416587437", "user": "rappoccio"}

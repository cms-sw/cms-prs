There are minor fluctuations in fake/duplicate rates induced by more precise sorting of hits in phi and potentially also from additional sorting of incoming seeds in phi (they were only sorted in eta before). There are additional hit-on-track processing changes expected in treatment of dead-regions, large clusters, and through usage of the additional per-module information that is now available -- following all these selection windows will be retuned to achieve optimal performance.\r\n\r\n### Related issues\r\n- This PR addresses the second long term issue in #36966.\r\n- Also included are minor log-printout changes requested by @qliphy in #37418 that were postponed in that PR (see commit 958ba5f).", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 29, "comments": 13, "commits": 14, "created_at": "1650037396", "deletions": 2691, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "tracking-pog-pending", "tracking"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 37586, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "open", "title": "[MkFit] Use binnor for seed and hit sorting, remove Ice/", "updated_at": "1650897653", "user": "osschar"}

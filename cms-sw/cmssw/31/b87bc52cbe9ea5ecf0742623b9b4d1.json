Current uHTR firmware only accepts the LUTs with the high bits (bits 12-15) set in HB, not in HE. This can be reversed to set the LUT bits for both HB and HE when the firmware is modified. The initial PR setting the HCAL LUT is in PR #35599, where more details on the specifications are given as well. Discussed with @Michael-Krohn in detail about the HCAL LUT generation.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nrunTheMatrix passed, tested in CMSSW_12_5_X_2022-07-28-2300.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1659394030", "comments": 16, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1659102285", "deletions": 8, "labels": ["alca-approved", "l1-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "bug-fix", "orp-approved", "urgent", "code-checks-approved", "hcal"], "merge_commit_sha": "3266dc586db97ab4da410b28bff1ed1d906eb0c3", "merged_at": "1659394030", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 38896, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "HCAL: Group 0 LUT edited to set LLP bits in HB only, not HE", "updated_at": "1659394030", "user": "gk199"}

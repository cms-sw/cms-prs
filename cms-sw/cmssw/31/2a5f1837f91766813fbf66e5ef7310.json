It looks like some of these files were recently moved to tape. This didn't cause any issues centrally (e.g. PR tests), because those same files are saved in the EOS user area of the cmsbot. On the other hand, some of the TSG scripts may now fail locally if only the LFN is specified (as there is no automatic fallback on to the EOS area of the cmsbot when running locally, afaiu).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n`addOnTests.py` passed.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

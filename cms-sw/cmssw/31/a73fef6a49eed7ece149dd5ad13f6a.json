As is we produce 38M, that with a 2.8% GEN-efficiency become ~1M. With this statistics we end up having >120k well reconstructed $B^0$. \r\n\r\n<img width=\"802\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-08-25 alle 21 57 28\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55cb7f7b-e636-4914-a68f-d92bf5046e36\">\r\n\r\nWith the new setup we should produce >50k clean candidates that should be well enough for a release validation.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nNone.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1725380992", "comments": 14, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1724609265", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["fully-signed", "tests-approved", "pdmv-approved", "orp-approved", "upgrade-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "642226948807c3a60a3b48e6505454700440edbe", "merged_at": "1725380992", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_14_2_X", "number": 45798, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Reduce RelVal Events for `B0ToJpsiK0s_JMM_Filter_DGamma0`", "updated_at": "1725380993", "user": "AdrianoDee"}

The functionality of the configuration is restored (by updating to the detector geometry D49 / T15, long-term supported for the HLT TDR) and a new unit test is added, exercising it.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe new unit test runs.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nNot a backport, no backport needed.\r\ncc:\r\n@vargasa \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1602868756", "comments": 12, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1602825218", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "09c29c646d7b9350fadae44428dba423269ecdc3", "merged_at": "1602868756", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 31820, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "[SLHCUpgradeSimulations/Geometry] update writeFile_phase2_cfg.py and use it for unit tests", "updated_at": "1602868757", "user": "mmusich"}

The new plotting script fixes several issues with the final plotting currently provided by the all-in-one; however, the replacement is not done in this PR and will have to be done at a second time. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRelies on the updated unit tests via:\r\n\r\n```\r\nscram b runtests_Zmumuall use-ibeos\r\n```\r\n\r\nalso this was privately tested in the automatic validation setup for the the alignment PCL. I re-run the plotting and obtained the figures posted [here](https://marcomusich.web.cern.ch/display/ZmmMerge/).\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

The new ID selection was proposed and studied by @gpetruc and @cbotta [1], and is optimized to have efficiency close to Loose muons and fake rate at the same level as Tight muons. \nFor monitoring purposes, few plots were included in muon offline DQM. A couple of plots are attached here, comparing eta and p distributions of Loose, Medium, and Tight muons. \n![p](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5376758/7327159/4fb3dc7e-eacb-11e4-999a-739e4c5abacd.png)\n![eta](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5376758/7327164/567c8cae-eacb-11e4-9719-02b706a6df39.png)\n\n[1] https://indico.cern.ch/event/357213/contribution/2/material/slides/0.pdf \n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1430718674", "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1429897626", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "05beb287730116ed062bff0681ba9f6fa23ebd7a", "merged_at": "1430718674", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 8876, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "New Medium muon ID selectors and offline DQM plots", "updated_at": "1430718674", "user": "trocino"}

This generates a data file containing Run 3 Scouting objects with known content. Then it reads it. It verifies that when we read it we obtain values that match the known written values for all the data fields in the objects. In particular all containers have content so all contained types are also read.\r\n\r\nIt also reads the old files in the DataFormats-Scouting data repository which are listed in the shell script. The plan is that each time a Run 3 Scouting data format is modified an additional file will added. The data files required for this PR were generated with releases 12_0_4 (2022 data) and 13_0_3 (2023 data).\r\n\r\nThere are 10 events with content and vector sizes varying from event to event.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis only adds a unit test in DataFormats/Scouting which passes. It shouldn't affect anything else.\r\n\r\nNote that the test will only pass if the cms-data/DataFormats-Scouting#1 pull request is merged and that external update is used. Waiting to merge this PR until a couple days after the data PR is merged might avoid some syncing difficulties in IBs and PR tests.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 8, "comments": 9, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1685560652", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["core-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "requires-external", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_2_X", "number": 41834, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 8, "state": "open", "title": "Add unit test for Run 3 Scouting formats", "updated_at": "1685675143", "user": "wddgit"}

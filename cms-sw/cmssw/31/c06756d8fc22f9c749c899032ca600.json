This is discussed in detail [here](https://indico.cern.ch/event/376580/contribution/3/material/slides/1.pdf). I have now confirmed that I can proceed with this so I'm doing so now. \n\nThis requires two changes. First it requires a new class, HLTRecHitInAllL1RegionsProducer which is a re-write of [HLTRechitInRegionsProducer](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/CMSSW_7_5_X/RecoEgamma/EgammaHLTProducers/interface/HLTRechitInRegionsProducer.h) generalised to accept any combination of L1 seed types. This class is vital the E/g HLT to save time filters the rec-hits used by the PFclusters to be near L1 seeds. This class has been tested on ~30 million events and when configured identically to the old class, it gives identical results.\n\nThe second change is to allow the HLTEgammaL1MatchFilterRegional filter to also try to look for L1 jets. If the L1 seed module does not contain a jet seed, nothing will happen.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1429675695", "comments": 9, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1429555160", "deletions": 7, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "hlt-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "77c472b537ff63a01c10e4326d207a0fc090871e", "merged_at": "1429675695", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 8804, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "allowing E/g HLT to be seeded by L1 jets", "updated_at": "1429675695", "user": "Sam-Harper"}

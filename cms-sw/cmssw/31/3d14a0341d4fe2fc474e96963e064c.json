This mode is not turned on by default.\n\n(b) Flags to expose the Fourier orders that are going to be subtracted. This was inadvertently hard-coded before.\n\nThe changes are merged due to otherwise conflicting diffs.\n\nIssues raised previously from Carl Vuosalo's review are already addressed here. \n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 11, "closed_at": "1447775036", "comments": 14, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1444836437", "deletions": 1931, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-rejected"], "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 11799, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 4, "state": "closed", "title": "Heavy ion Vs algorithm same event subtraction", "updated_at": "1447775036", "user": "yslai"}

As such, adding the option to select on saturated clusters can help to further reduce the contributions from beam background, which in 2025 PbPb data taking ended up been much larger than in previous years.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested with relvals 141.201,141.202,142.201,142.202,143.201,143.202,144.201,144.202,180.0.180.1,181.0,181.1,182.0,182.1,183.0,183.1 \r\n\r\n@mandrenguyen @flodamas @vince502", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "comments": 5, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1771355039", "deletions": 45, "labels": ["hlt-pending", "analysis-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_1_X", "number": 50167, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 8, "state": "open", "title": "Update HLTPixelThrustFilter to consider saturated pixels", "updated_at": "1771422654", "user": "stahlleiton"}

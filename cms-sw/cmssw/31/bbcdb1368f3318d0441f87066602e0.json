The modelling of the dynamic gain in a particular strip hasn't changed.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested locally, performance of the algorithm in TIB and TOB is unchanged as expected (similar data-MC agreement as before), and improved description of data seen in TID and TEC layers.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1570559545", "comments": 37, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1569585178", "deletions": 90, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "db-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "6dde6db53cd8eb27c864a4caff682c404d2e2e4d", "merged_at": "1570559545", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 28081, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 5, "state": "closed", "title": "Simulate APV dynamic gain in TID and TEC", "updated_at": "1570559546", "user": "EmyrClement"}

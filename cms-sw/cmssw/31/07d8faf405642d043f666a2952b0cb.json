It is only enabled for Millepede. If other alignment algorithms want to use it a flag has to be set to `True`:\r\n```\r\nprocess.AlignmentProducer.enableAlignableUpdates = True\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe code is based on top of #17408, i.e. to better digest the changes, it might be useful to first review and eventually approve #17408.\r\n\r\nEDIT: A dedicated presentation on this update has been given at the [Tracker Alignment meeting on 01-Mar-2017](https://indico.cern.ch/event/607508/contributions/2493829/attachments/1420329/2176319/Alignment-MultiIOV_CMS-TkAl_20170301.pdf)", "branch": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "changed_files": 64, "closed_at": "1489508350", "comments": 36, "commits": 52, "created_at": "1486650566", "deletions": 1154, "labels": ["alca-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "937a0f7d4811564cfb8872d78976f54e3f384569", "merged_at": "1489508350", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "number": 17475, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "[90X] Allow multi-IOV input for Millepede alignment framework", "updated_at": "1493733192", "user": "ghellwig"}

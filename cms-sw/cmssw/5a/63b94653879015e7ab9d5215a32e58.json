With PFElectron- and PFPhotonAlgo gone, there are no other algos to share the calibrations with anyway\r\n* therefore I got rid of all usages of shared_ptr in RecoParticleFlow/PFProducer\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCMSSW compiles and matrix tests pass.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 10, "closed_at": "1560794016", "comments": 29, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1560148391", "deletions": 648, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "3ed3a8942e5aa33c597f3485edeb13a4a6ba1f8f", "merged_at": "1560794016", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27154, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Avoid shared_ptr in RecoParticleFlow/PFProducer and remove PFSCEnergyCalibration", "updated_at": "1560794016", "user": "guitargeek"}

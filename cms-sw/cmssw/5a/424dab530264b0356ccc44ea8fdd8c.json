The latest default scenario when this was active was D49, dropped from the release since a while.\r\n\r\nThe ETL numbering scheme is cleaned for the corresponding possible numbering construction.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the unit test in ```RecoMTD/DetLayers``` is updated, by adding a test of the module finding in BTL with a scan in phi at fixed z.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles, the MTD geometry unit tests are correctly running.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 28, "closed_at": "1690522958", "comments": 24, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1690282519", "deletions": 15236, "labels": ["dqm-approved", "geometry-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "upgrade-approved", "requires-external", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "20664b8c48596e4f2d6491d2498b7e233a4e5204", "merged_at": "1690522958", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_13_3_X", "number": 42354, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "MTD geometry: remove code for obsolete ETL ring-based scenario", "updated_at": "1690522958", "user": "fabiocos"}

More detailed comments will be added as part of the review.\r\n>\r\n>Summary:\r\n>```bash\r\n>./getHLT.sh --dbproxy # will now work\r\n>./getFrozenHLT.sh --dbproxy # will now work\r\n>./makeSubtables --dbproxy # will now work\r\n>./runAll.csh [..] # does not query ConfDB anymore (content of the tests is unchanged)\r\n>\r\n>hltIntegrationTests hlt.py [..] # will now work\r\n>hltListPaths hlt.py [..] # will now work\r\n>```\r\n>\r\n>The aim is to add functionalities, and leave current behaviour unchanged (except for tweaks to the printouts of `hltIntegrationTests` and `get{Frozen,}HLT.sh`).\r\n>\r\n>Merely technical. No differences expected in the outputs of PR tests (this PR is basically insensitive to PR tests).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nNone beyond the tests done for #40004.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

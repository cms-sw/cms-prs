The sizes in the definitions of the digi tables already contain the variables but the for loops that fill those tables has hardcoded numbers instead of variables. This is a fix to make the nTS modification from the configuration script to work properly. This change was originally done locally by Alexi Mestvirishvili.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI ran the script in https://gitlab.cern.ch/cmshcal/hcalpfg/hcalnanoprod/-/blob/main/test/globalrun_cfg.py with default inputs and the output file had 3 time slices for HF, as expected. I also ran the script in https://gitlab.cern.ch/cmshcal/hcalpfg/hcalnanoprod/-/blob/main/test/localrun_cfg.py the same way. I edited the line: process.hcalDigiSortedTable.nTS_HF = cms.untracked.uint32(x) with x=6, 8 and 12. The output files from these instances were created with 6, 8 and 12 time slices for HF, respectively.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1376, "closed_at": "1720464688", "comments": 1, "commits": 914, "created_at": "1720464401", "deletions": 335561, "labels": [], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 45403, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "CMSSW_14_0_11_nTSfix", "updated_at": "1720464693", "user": "kaderci-johannes"}

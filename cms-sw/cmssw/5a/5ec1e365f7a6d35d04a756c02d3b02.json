It can be switched ON by the `ecal_deepsc` process modifier. \r\n\r\nThe DeepSC algorithm has been presented in ECAL, PF and ML group meetings. More documentation and details can be find in the links below.\r\n\r\n##### Recent talks and documentation:\r\n- ACAT2021 proceeding: https://cms.cern.ch/iCMS/user/noteinfo?cmsnoteid=CMS%20CR-2022/031\r\n- DPS note approved for ACAT2021: https://cds.cern.ch/record/2792321\r\n- PF meeting:  https://indico.cern.ch/event/1102164/#1-ml-based-ecal-clustering\r\n- ML Townhall meeting 2021: https://indico.cern.ch/event/1045606/timetable/#20210726.detailed\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nNo changes are expected in any standard workflow. The DeepSC model is only activated by the run3_ecalclustering process modifier.

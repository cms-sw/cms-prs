In the future we should assign this module to a POG (probably BTV)\n\n@lgray @matteosan1  please have a look at the EGM modules . I think I changed them correctly\nOne other EGM action item is to clean up the PF EGM code that we dont use . I think 80X is a good place to do this so please make sure somebody does it at some point \n\n @VinInn @makortel @rovere   you can start from here to add new iterations\nMajor issue for tracking: You can-NOT just add iterations in the file as it was done in #12577 \nAll the MET tails we had in 2015 was due to tracking so if one iteration introduces MET tails it needs to have some Dpt/pt cuts . So for every PR that has new iterations one should look at the PFMET distribution before and after in RelVal FlatQCD and even one additional event in the tail is enough to tell you there are problems. \nSo looking forward to see this in the future\n\n@arizzi  @gpetruc FYI\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 19, "closed_at": "1450053079", "comments": 59, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1449591948", "deletions": 355, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "56429f1fea6d31bb3b73ac1b775781de13950da2", "merged_at": "1450053079", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 12715, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 21, "state": "closed", "title": "Factorization of Track Iteration selections in PF", "updated_at": "1450182481", "user": "bachtis"}

The issue is explained in the following hypernews: https://hypernews.cern.ch/HyperNews/CMS/get/L1TriggerSW/677.html\nIn summary, the main problem is that since the simulated external conditions are not packed when performing the L1 simulation, then the HLTMuonL1TFilter does not pass any event.\n\nThe issue is solved if we apply the following two changes:\n- Change the external condition input collection in the gtStage2Raw packer from simGtStage2Digis  to  simGtExtFakeStage2Digis\n- Then add again the  packer of external conditions in the GTSetup.cc\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1477524184", "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1474736532", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "l1-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 15976, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Packing simulated L1 External Conditions", "updated_at": "1477873572", "user": "stahlleiton"}

Previously, with DD4hep, no temperature or pressure was specified for the materials, so they gained the defaults from ROOT, which are STP, Standard Temperature and Pressure, 273.15 K and 1 atm. However, with DDD the material temperatures are 293.15, which corresponds to NTP, Normal Temperature and Pressure.\r\n\r\nThis PR sets the DD4hep conditions to NTP, and then uses those values to set the material temperatures and pressures.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe test script `SimG4Core/PrintGeomInfo/test/python/g4OverlapCheck_dd4hep_cfg.py` shows that the material temperatures with this PR are now 293.15 K.\r\n\r\nNo backport.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1617833014", "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1617718235", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "a5c29c79687047760ed62ef8e4002832dbbfaf1d", "merged_at": "1617833014", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 33344, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "[DD4hep] Set material temperature and pressure to NTP instead of default STP", "updated_at": "1617833014", "user": "cvuosalo"}

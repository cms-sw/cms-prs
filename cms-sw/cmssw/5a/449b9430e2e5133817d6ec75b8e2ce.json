Please see that PR for full details.\r\nThis PR includes only the code change to produce the DD4hep Run 3 extended geometry description DB payload with the standard order of materials. The XML changes from #34974 are not strictly necessary because the materials affected are not used in 12_0.\r\n\r\nNote that this PR should not change any workflow. The changes in this PR affect only the tool for creating the extended geometry description DB payload, which is run manually. This PR does contain changes to the DDCMS parser, but those lines are protected by a flag that is true only when the DB payload is being created.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe extended geometry description created with this PR was checked to be identical with the existing DD4hep extended geometry description in the DB, except for re-ordering of materials. The material order was checked to ensure no materials are referenced before they are defined.", "branch": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1630071859", "comments": 8, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1629741200", "deletions": 17, "labels": ["geometry-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "10323b3ccb49ea5b52aee7d42ba6e1f021f3a567", "merged_at": "1630071859", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "number": 34987, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "[DD4hep] Revise order of materials, partial backport of #34974", "updated_at": "1630071860", "user": "cvuosalo"}

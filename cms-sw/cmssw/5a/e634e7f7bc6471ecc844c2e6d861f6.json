It was removed a few months later when run-dependent workflows were \"cleaned up\" in PR #29457. Other run-dependent workflows are intended for use with full relvals and so many lumiblocks must be crossed before changing the run number. Since AlCa would like to foster further development of run-dependent MC, it is very useful to test that IOV boundaries can be crossed in MC without crashing, and I would like to have this workflow back.\r\n\r\nI also added an autoCond key `phase1_2018_realistic_rd` with a value corresponding to a MC GT for 2018 run-dependent MC. The time-dependent relvals have been updated to use this key rather than conditions overrides.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nAfter running `runTheMatrix.py -l 250202.183`, I checked that the DIGI-PREMIX and RECO files contain events with two different run numbers:\r\n\r\n- Run 315257: events 1-5\r\n- Run 316083: events 6-10\r\n\r\nThis is the expectation given the configuration.\r\n\r\n`runTheMatrix.py -l 250202.182` also completes successfully.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nThis PR is not a backport and should not be backported.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1612675249", "comments": 13, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1612232653", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "pdmv-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "d6cebc4021856fea3e1ab2378c42ba782d943786", "merged_at": "1612675249", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 32786, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add workflow to cross run number boundaries in IB tests", "updated_at": "1612675249", "user": "christopheralanwest"}

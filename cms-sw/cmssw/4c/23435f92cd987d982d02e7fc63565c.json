Modify the module\nto be a \"One\" type module with shared resources\ndeclared for GEANT and the CLHEPRandomEngine.\nIt is also \"watching\" runs. Note that with this\nchange it will now seg fault if any random numbers\nwere generated in the constructor or beginRun.\nSimProducer is fixed to deal with the changed module\ntype. We are presuming the static code checking would\nreveal any other threading problems related to making\nthis a \"One\" type module. This is for GEANT 4.9.X.\nWe will need to revisit this when we move to 4.10.X,\nwhich will be the multithreaded GEANT.\n\nThe only changes in Validation are the addition of\na missing forward declaration revealed by the other\nchanges.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 10, "closed_at": "1385394559", "comments": 8, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1385043008", "deletions": 48, "labels": ["core-approved", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "40e0816e4a633e3e73c8ec0bf82ba39e3918bdbd", "merged_at": "1385394559", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_0_0_pre9", "number": 1554, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "Threaded Random Number Interface for OscarProducer", "updated_at": "1386873114", "user": "wddgit"}

This is done by requiring the `T` to have a nested type `Tokens` that then does the `consumes` call and holds the `ESGetToken`s and is then passed to the constructor of `T` (in case `T` does not consume any ESProducts, it can define `Tokens` as `void` and have no further effect).\r\n\r\nIn principle I think a \"maker\" pattern would have been more applicable (`T` would be a \"maker\" that would be used to produce the concrete `JetTagComputer` in `JetTagComputerESProducer<T>::produce()`), but that would have been much heavier refactoring to which I did not want to go.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 25, "closed_at": "1562520193", "comments": 50, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1562131490", "deletions": 166, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "88df63898332948c93270b1fcd5f91e1751d1fb0", "merged_at": "1562520193", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27430, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "Use ESGetToken in JetTagComputerESProducer<T>", "updated_at": "1562520194", "user": "makortel"}

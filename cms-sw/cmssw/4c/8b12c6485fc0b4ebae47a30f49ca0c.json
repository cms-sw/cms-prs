Change all 2D histograms that were used as an input for making a profile in harvesting step to TProfile (mean chi2 vs. eta, phi, nhits; mean number of hits vs. eta, phi; more specific mean numbers of hits or layers vs. eta).\n2. Rebinned various 1D histograms (number of tracks; TrackingParticle pT, eta, vertex transverse position, bunch crossing)\n\nIn addition, the histogram of TrackingParticles/event is again filled (only in-time BX is considered).\n\nTested in CMSSW_7_5_X_2015-06-06-2300, following changes are expected (black old, red new):\n- Tiny numerical differences in the previously-2D-now-TProfile histograms, e.g. mean chi2 vs. eta\n  ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/33993/8057379/2839a138-0eb1-11e5-9ad3-58b99cfe6ffd.png)\n- Chi2 vs. nhits is shifted by -0.5 hits (the binning is now the same as in other nhits histograms)\n  ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/33993/8057263/f517d21c-0eaf-11e5-833d-66fa7adbe729.png)\n- All \"number of tracks\" histograms have different binning, e.g.\n  ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/33993/8057287/328a6934-0eb0-11e5-8c2b-b28fb3532482.png)\n- The histogram under `.../simulation` folder have different binning, e.g.\n  ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/33993/8057300/4fb83a04-0eb0-11e5-9e07-520be9e828bc.png)\n\n@rovere @VinInn \n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 9, "closed_at": "1433871701", "comments": 10, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1433846397", "deletions": 80, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "d2d790be49898d73fe0ccea45553007d03f82fa1", "merged_at": "1433871701", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 9524, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Reduce MultiTrackValidator memory use", "updated_at": "1476956365", "user": "makortel"}

Plots below are for 0 pileup HGCal, since the leak is for each generator particle I don't think it's proportional to pileup (only have gen particles for the signal event).\n\n@lgray says the check for integer charge is unnecessary so the original daughter particle address can used instead of creating a copy.\n@lgray, can you check this PR is okay?  As I understand it Pandora needs to be told explicitly about relationships, so the `SetMCParentDaughterRelationship` is still required even though the original particle has a pointer to the daughter, right?\n\nBoth plots are the memory retained by each module (top 25 only) after event execution, excluding the products they put in the event.\nBefore:\n![pandorafixbefore](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6480160/7630847/ac9e3da0-fa32-11e4-8d64-db5b8c043b9e.png)\nAnd after:\n![pandorafixafter](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6480160/7630849/ae85fe5a-fa32-11e4-8437-2814b90e6620.png)\n", "branch": "CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1431909702", "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1431595331", "deletions": 9, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "new-package-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "c66253dd744866ea73a7c7cf6c80643c18d035cb", "merged_at": "1431909702", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "number": 9084, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix memory leak in PandoraTranslator", "updated_at": "1431957298", "user": "mark-grimes"}

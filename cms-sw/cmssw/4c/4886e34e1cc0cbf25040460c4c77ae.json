This completes implementation of this new feature. There is a test of its usage in the class ViewAnalyzer in function testStdVectorPtr which is run by ViewTest_cfg.py in the package FWCore/Integration. This does change interfaces. Code in the release was fixed to compile and so that runTheMatrix will pass. But runtime problems could exist in code not run in runThe Matrix and compile time problems for code not in the release. For example, it is no longer possible to get the container product from a Ref which implies many things. For example on cannot construct a RefProd from a Ref. One change in particular that might cause problems. If one inserts into an AssociationMap constructed with the no argument constructor an exception will be thrown at runtime, There is known code like this in the release, although none is called in runTheMatrix tests.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 174, "closed_at": "1428166928", "comments": 41, "commits": 86, "created_at": "1427402707", "deletions": 1481, "labels": ["alca-pending", "analysis-pending", "comparison-available", "core-pending", "dqm-pending", "hlt-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-pending", "tests-rejected"], "merge_commit_sha": "a21a83ec86d9146df4a0028d146f98c698745825", "merged_at": "1428166928", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 8559, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 4, "state": "closed", "title": "Add Support for View of vector of Ptr", "updated_at": "1432057520", "user": "wddgit"}

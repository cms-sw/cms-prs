The absence of these dictionaries causes step 4 of relval test 1001 to fail.\nThis pull request adds these dictionaries to CondCore/ORA.  Note that these dictionaries were also needed in ROOT 5, but only for the CondCore/ORA unit tests.  Since these dictionaries will now be in CondCore/ORA itself, they no longer are needed in CondCore/ORA/test, as these would be duplicate definitions.\nNote that this pull request is not sufficient to make step 4 of relval 1001 run successfully , because with this pull request, the test fails later for a different reason. Please merge promptly.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_2_ROOT6_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1403806275", "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1403805791", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "db-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "b3ae0905d2f8f36eb705baabcd0dd8fe0b420f38", "merged_at": "1403806275", "merged_by": "davidlt", "number": 4412, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Dictionaries needed for ROOT 6", "updated_at": "1403806416", "user": "wmtan"}

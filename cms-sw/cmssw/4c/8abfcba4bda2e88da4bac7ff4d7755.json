However, for certain `MG5_aMC@NLO FxFx` samplessuch as `TTH-Hto2G_Par-M-125_TuneCP5_13p6TeV_amcatnloFXFX-pythia8`the Higgs does not appear among the children of vertices()[0].\r\n\r\nAs a result, the HTXS Rivet module fails to assign a valid Higgs production mode, which propagates to a failure in HTXS categorization during MiniAODNanoAOD production. This PR updates the logic to automatically identify the first GenVertex that contains a Higgs boson among its outgoing particles, rather than assuming it is located at vertices()[0].\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe updated logic was validated by running MiniAOD  NanoAOD workflows on both:\r\n- MG5_aMC@NLO FxFx samples (e.g. problematic TTH FxFx datasets)\r\n- POWHEG samples\r\n\r\nIn all tested samples, the HTXS production mode and category are now correctly assigned.\r\n\r\n@mseidel42 \r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1765899831", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["generators-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_0_X", "number": 49644, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "auto detect first vertex with Higgs in children list", "updated_at": "1765901080", "user": "yihui-lai"}

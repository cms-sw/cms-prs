I added a simple check; not sure if it's optimal or comprehensive in this case.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRan jetToolbox several times and observed correct behavior (either runs to completion or throws `\"Input is not a pat::Jet.\"` when expected), rather than unexpected exceptions or segfaults.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nThis PR will be backported to 10_6_X for those running on UL samples. Other backports can be made upon request.\r\n\r\nattn: @andrzejnovak ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 7, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1661383128", "deletions": 9, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_6_X", "number": 39184, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Fixes for DeepDoubleX", "updated_at": "1662014697", "user": "kpedro88"}

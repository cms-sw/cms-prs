To reiterate, photon's PF isolation is `nan` in some rare cases in Run3 data and MC. This PR fixes that. So it would be nice if 12_4_X MC production release has this fix in. This will also be useful for the rest of the prompt-reco data. \r\n\r\nRelated github issue: https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/39110  ", "branch": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1661451745", "deletions": 10, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "backport-ok"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 39202, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[12_4_X backport] Do NaN-check before accepting a PF candidate for computing photon's isolation", "updated_at": "1661451957", "user": "swagata87"}

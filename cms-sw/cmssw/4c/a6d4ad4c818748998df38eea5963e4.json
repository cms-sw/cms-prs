To reiterate, photon's PF isolation is `nan` in some rare cases in Run3 data and MC. This PR fixes that. So it would be nice if 12_4_X MC production release has this fix in. This will also be useful for the rest of the prompt-reco data. \r\n\r\nRelated github issue: https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/39110  ", "branch": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1661497129", "comments": 10, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1661451745", "deletions": 10, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "backport-ok", "egamma"], "merge_commit_sha": "250e67c31e4df58adfe04b222b637ba5114c76fb", "merged_at": "1661497128", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 39202, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "[12_4_X backport] Do NaN-check before accepting a PF candidate for computing photon's isolation", "updated_at": "1661497129", "user": "swagata87"}

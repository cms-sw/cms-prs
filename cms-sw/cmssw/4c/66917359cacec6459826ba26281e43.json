The ClusterTPAssociation is built in a way that for a given cluster you can access the corresponding TP using the equal_range function. The other way around (for a given TP get the clusters) is not possible due to the ordering of the map. After a discussion with Matti Kortelainen (@makortel)  he proposed to add this getter function, such that externally the user can order the map in his/her preferred way (according to TP rather than according to the clusters) and get the clusters for a given TP.\n\nThis was tested and indeed works. \n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1477635101", "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1477546397", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "017c6838ba0911f9f3bd4a9fc6fdfe1fbb5071d1", "merged_at": "1477635101", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 16367, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Added a getter for the ClusterTPAssociation::map_", "updated_at": "1477635102", "user": "smoortga"}

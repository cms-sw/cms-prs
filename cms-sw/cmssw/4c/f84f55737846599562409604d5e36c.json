The decay-mode is as returned by `PhysicsTools/JetMCUtils/src/JetMCTag.cc` with value converted to an integer as defined in the enum in `DataFormats/TauReco/interface/PFTau.h` (Tau POG standard). In case of an undecayed genTau the status is negative and can be used to filter out corresponding genTauJet.\r\nThe `PhysicsTools/JetMCUtils/src/JetMCTag.cc` tool was modified to deal correctly with genTauJets for undecayed genTaus where the genTau is its unique constituent. Namely, in this case the \"tau\" decay-mode is returned.\r\nThis PR is a followup for #41064 and implements promise from https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/41064#issuecomment-1472227706.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nPR tested successfully with wf 10024.0 (\"TTbar_13+2017\")\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1679071796", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_1_X", "number": 41092, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Add tau decay-mode to genTauJets as status", "updated_at": "1679072259", "user": "mbluj"}

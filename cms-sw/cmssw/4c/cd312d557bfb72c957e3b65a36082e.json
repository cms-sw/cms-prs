Such macro can be used to declare aggregate objects that are available both on the host and on the device.\r\nNote these objects may be at different memory addresses on the host and device, so their pointers will be different -- but the actual values should be the same.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nNone.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1646657194", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["core-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 37159, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Define HOST_DEVICE_CONSTANT to implement constexpr aggregate host/device constants", "updated_at": "1646704145", "user": "fwyzard"}

It seems to be more common than I expected.\r\n\r\nThis indicates that the problem was not caused (or exposed) by HCAL/Phase2 DQM, but rather that something in ROOT or the framework made it show up.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis PR is mainly for validation of the issue discovered in #26722 in the PR tests. It should be save to merge into an IB, though for now, the tests will fail until all subsystem code is fixed.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1557917818", "comments": 16, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1557397224", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-notrun", "dqm-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-rejected"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 26726, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "DQM: Assert non-zero-width range for histograms", "updated_at": "1557917818", "user": "schneiml"}

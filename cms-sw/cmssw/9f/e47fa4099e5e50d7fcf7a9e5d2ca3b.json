This change is necessary in order to collect all the jet constituents of `slimmedJetsAK8` stored in MiniAOD where subjets and the remaining jet constituents are added as daughters. This is a follow-up to #12890\n\nThe code changes affect the `pfBoostedDoubleSecondaryVertexAK8BJetTags` discriminator embedded in `slimmedJetsAK8` in MiniAOD but should leave its numerical values unchanged.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1453883078", "comments": 10, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1453199339", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "d4528617b8fc4dd840ed11b384c79284db2d8f83", "merged_at": "1453883078", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 12988, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Updated N-subjettiness computation in BoostedDoubleSecondaryVertex tagger", "updated_at": "1453884551", "user": "ferencek"}

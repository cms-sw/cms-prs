If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nThis is not a backport, but a backport to 15_0_X and 15_1_X will follow.\r\n\r\nFYI: @silviodonato @mmusich \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 11, "comments": 10, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1759833568", "deletions": 47, "labels": ["operations-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "pdmv-approved", "tests-started", "upgrade-approved", "code-checks-approved", "xpog-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_0_X", "number": 49084, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Update skipEventsWithoutScoutingByEra for ScoutingNano", "updated_at": "1759835942", "user": "patinkaew"}

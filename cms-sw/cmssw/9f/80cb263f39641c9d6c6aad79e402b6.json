If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nThis is not a backport, but a backport to 15_0_X and 15_1_X will follow.\r\n\r\nFYI: @silviodonato @mmusich \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 11, "closed_at": "1759905301", "comments": 13, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1759833568", "deletions": 47, "labels": ["operations-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "pdmv-approved", "orp-approved", "upgrade-approved", "code-checks-approved", "xpog-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "0c06e433408bdb6c5f29a47d0d54ed5b18b11331", "merged_at": "1759905301", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_16_0_X", "number": 49084, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Update skipEventsWithoutScoutingByEra for ScoutingNano", "updated_at": "1759905302", "user": "patinkaew"}

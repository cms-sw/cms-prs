The ProducerBase::produces function is now a protected member of ProducerBase. When produces needs to be called in a helper class (outside the module constructor), the ProducesCollector must be used. This PR also migrates all the code in the repository to work with this change. It does not affect modules that call produces directly inside their constructor.  The purpose is to reduce the number of things that depend on ProducerBase. Helper classes used by modules no longer need to depend on it.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nIncludes a new unit test for the ProducesCollector class.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 109, "closed_at": "1572462294", "comments": 26, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1570723764", "deletions": 352, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "core-approved", "fastsim-approved", "fully-signed", "hlt-approved", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "f42c909c15e3a088d9ef3f8b535a181a7509c4ea", "merged_at": "1572462294", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 28154, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Initial Implementation of ProducesCollector", "updated_at": "1572462294", "user": "wddgit"}

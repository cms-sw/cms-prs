To that effect, the value of the significance cut was changed from the default 3. to ~ infinity in the `fillDescriptions` of `VertexAssociatorByPositionAndTracksProducer`. This makes sense **only** if the association method (variable `weightMethod`) is not `\"none\"` (which is the current default for the offline validation). In case one wants to use the \"old\" default the `sigmaZ` cut needs to be in place. \r\nThe issue was spotted in the offline `CMSSW_16_0_0_pre4` validation: https://cern.ch/krpwx by @borzari \r\n\r\nTo fix the issue we revert the `sigmaZ` cut to 3 and we change it explicitly only when needed (i.e. when `weightMethod` is equal to `dzError`)\r\n \r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI run in `CMSSW_16_1_X_2026-02-09-2300` with / and without this branch and big difference is seen e.g. in the vertex merge rate:\r\n\r\n| Current release | This PR |\r\n| ------------- | ------------- |\r\n| <img width=\"957\" height=\"1009\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aa0f191d-37a0-449b-8c9e-4b4f0efa70d7\" /> | <img width=\"1122\" height=\"1009\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4906234b-c96f-407d-b364-35881733aa5b\" /> |\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

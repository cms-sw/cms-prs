In such circumstances the error is meaningless since there are no inputs to the calorimeter trigger. The changes remove the check that both CALOL2 and uGT sum collections are not empty but leaves the check that the length of those should not be different.\r\n\r\n10_1_x backport is here #22883\r\n10_0_x backport is here #22884", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1523510403", "comments": 19, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1523014706", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "9d146710426872b3e4d9cd10c5f8beadf145f04f", "merged_at": "1523510403", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 22878, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "Remove check for empty sum collection in CALOL2-uGT comparison", "updated_at": "1523510403", "user": "ashtipliyski"}

Currently, it can have just one.\nThe previous syntax used for subprocesses in python config files is not compatible with multiple subprocesses, so the new syntax is:\n\n  process2 = cms.Process(\"Whatever\") \n  process.addSubProcess(cms.SubProcess(process2))\n\nAll existing uses of SubProcess in CMSSW were modified to use the new syntax. There were no such uses outside the framework.\n\nThis is being submitted to 8_0_X because it is new development, and it is my understanding that 7_6_X is now closed to new development. If this is wanted in 7_6_X, it can easily be backported.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 25, "closed_at": "1446016368", "comments": 16, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1445362724", "deletions": 241, "labels": ["comparison-available", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "tests-rejected"], "merge_commit_sha": "33f4460433023c25f0d4810ede2cc03d496a9d42", "merged_at": "1446016368", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 12001, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 10, "state": "closed", "title": "Support multiple subprocesses", "updated_at": "1447039512", "user": "wmtan"}

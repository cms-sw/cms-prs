The current setup overwrites the cut value of `ak8PFJetsPuppiConstituents` when a production workflow involves RECO step and PAT step in a single production job, like the ongoing Run-3 Data production workflow (RAW->RECO->PAT). This issue was reported in a XPOG meeting earlier today ([17th May 2023](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1282867/#10-mini-from-mini-workflow-upd)).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\npasses the usual runTheMatrix test: `runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos`", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 14, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1684334567", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "bug-fix", "code-checks-approved", "xpog-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_2_X", "number": 41710, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Fix ak8PFJetsPuppiConstituents module configuration at PAT-level", "updated_at": "1685968790", "user": "nurfikri89"}

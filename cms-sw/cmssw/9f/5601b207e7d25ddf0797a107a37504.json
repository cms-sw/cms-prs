We added a protection in the combination code to only use the Ep combination MVA at high energies when the track pT error is smaller than 10 times the track pT. It is a pretty safe cut that removes these badly measured tracks from the determination of the electron energy.\n\nReference: https://hypernews.cern.ch/HyperNews/CMS/get/physTools/3446/1/1/1/1.html\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1455612297", "comments": 11, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1455523057", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "148916eb48babbe8292df72a05488dad0539b9b2", "merged_at": "1455612297", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 13279, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Ep combination protection", "updated_at": "1485955645", "user": "rafaellopesdesa"}

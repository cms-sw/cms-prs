It was inevitable. It contains the latest version of the EMTF++ emulator. The emulator is used to study the Phase-2 upgrade of EMTF. Other projects are waiting to integrate the emulator into their code. *This code was developed and tested in CMSSW 13.3.0pre3*.\r\n\r\n**Note on GEM changes**\r\nInitially, the emulator was designed for CMSSW 12.5.0pre3 and updated to CMSSW 13.3.0pre3. In this version of CMSSW, the GEM group renamed the ME0 chambers to GE0. However, this was not propagated to the L1Trigger packages, resulting in a few errors. Thanks to Ian Watson, I integrated GE0 to the L1Trigger in CMSSW 13.3.0pre3. I had to use a version of his fix intended for CMSSW 12.5.0pre3 for it to work. I checked the latest releases of CMSSW, and these fixes still need to arrive. Here's a link to Ian's fork containing the fix: https://github.com/watson-ij/cmssw/tree/2023-07-ge0-for-l1t-1253p3/L1Trigger\r\n\r\nBesides this, there weren't any other major issues when moving to CMSSW 13.3.0pre3.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis PR is a follow-up to the [PR1184](https://github.com/cms-l1t-offline/cmssw/pull/1184). The CMS L1T, offline software group, checked this PR. They've reviewed my changes and given me the green light to make a PR to the main CMSSW branch.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 110, "comments": 65, "commits": 29, "created_at": "1705931851", "deletions": 48, "labels": ["l1-approved", "simulation-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "upgrade-approved", "requires-external", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 43766, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 36, "state": "open", "title": "Adding EMTF++ Emulator for Phase-2", "updated_at": "1710260119", "user": "omiguelc"}

This picks the by-const-ref overload, which casts the const away (causing the warning) and calls the non-const version - I guess it is actually there only because the non-const version cannot be used on a temporary `cms::Exception`.\r\nUsing a universal reference instead should work for both (non-const) lvalue and rvalue references, I think, hence this PR, but please someone more expert on C++ check if the changes make sense.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1531936403", "comments": 17, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1531720671", "deletions": 57, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "61c24525249fe928ac3e87b01b0b919db51cb940", "merged_at": "1531936403", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_3_X", "number": 23801, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Avoid const_cast in operator<<(cms::Exception, ...)", "updated_at": "1531936403", "user": "pieterdavid"}

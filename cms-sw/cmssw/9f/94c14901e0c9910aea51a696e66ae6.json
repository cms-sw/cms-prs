We rely on part of RunC data (fills 8807 to 8901) to generate such pileup distribution. More details have been discussed in the PPD General Meeting (see link https://indico.cern.ch/event/1299290/).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe added code has been tested with CMSSW_13_2_0_pre2, using the root file `/store/relval/CMSSW_13_0_0_pre4/RelValMinBias_13p6TeV/GEN-SIM/130X_mcRun3_2022_realistic_withNewBSFromEOY2022Data_v1_RV186-v1/00000/18441d91-eeb9-46a9-bc4a-f5c388ef5e27.root`\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

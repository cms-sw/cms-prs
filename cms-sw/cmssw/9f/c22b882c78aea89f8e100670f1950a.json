Some of the tags (`SiStripBadChannel_PCL_v1_prompt`, `BeamSpotObjects_PCL_byRun_v1_prompt` and `BeamSpotObjects_PCL_byLumi_v1_prompt`) had `pcl` synchronization in Prep DB which prevented their upload from Tier0 replays. With this PR those tags are replaced and it also updates a few other ones to have different names between Prod and Prep tags to avoid such a case in Prep DB inthe  future.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the new DMD tag produced with the changes introduced here and the previous one can be seen in https://cern.ch/go/LC9S\r\n\r\nThe new DMD tag has been included in the `126X_dataRun3_Express_Queue` and will be picked up when a new Express GT is created.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n- created a Candidate GT by queueing the new tag to `126X_dataRun3_Express_Queue`\r\n- ran the RTM workflow 1001.3 with the candidate GT from above\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nBackport of #40522\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_12_6_X", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1675143014", "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1675109738", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["alca-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "db-approved", "orp-approved", "backport-ok"], "merge_commit_sha": "3dee19c55100e4d09ad19b19d735fd083d7ea377", "merged_at": "1675143014", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_6_X", "number": 40640, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "[12_6_X] Update data files for DropBoxMetadata tag", "updated_at": "1675143014", "user": "saumyaphor4252"}

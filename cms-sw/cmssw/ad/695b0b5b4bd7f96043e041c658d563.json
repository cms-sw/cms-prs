However, the structure of autoSkim has been updated following the discussion in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/37656\r\n   + `autoSkimRunII` is made (clone of current `autoSkim`).\r\n   + autoSkim is now for Run-3. The review and following PR should come when PDs are available.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nNone. No change is expected for the PR test since monopole skim will not change anything in DQM histograms.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\nNo need of backport.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1652464282", "comments": 15, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1650624920", "deletions": 11, "labels": ["fully-signed", "tests-approved", "pdmv-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "b0d3f2f465fd96e7ee3821ad0542e29acb011cac", "merged_at": "1652464282", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 37655, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Update monopole autoskim", "updated_at": "1652464282", "user": "srimanob"}

Otherwise, we get a warning with `scram b`. This was already done in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/33143, but in the meantime a few new `<use name=\"DataFormats/MuonData\"/>` were introduced in CMSSW that needed to be fixed.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCMSSW compiles.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nNo backport intended.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 24, "closed_at": "1617345521", "comments": 27, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1616844460", "deletions": 28, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "code-checks-approved", "db-pending", "dqm-approved", "geometry-approved", "heterogeneous-approved", "hlt-approved", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "c4fa24133b6da43ff75d275ae28912cb1aefdd97", "merged_at": "1617345521", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 33282, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 6, "state": "closed", "title": "Clean BuildFiles and add source_only flags to fix warnings", "updated_at": "1617651067", "user": "guitargeek"}

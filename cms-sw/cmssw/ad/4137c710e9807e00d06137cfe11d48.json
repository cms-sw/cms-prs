As is now only `qBin==0` is taken into account and should not be like this. Additionally with https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/44813 this ends up in an infinite loop (that is also how I spotted it). \r\n\r\nBeing the author I honestly don't remember why this was like this originally. One of the hypotheses is that the template for Phase 2 pixels was not available at the time of the CUDA port. But I haven't done all the proper archeology. \r\n\r\nFixes for both for Alpaka and CUDA.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1715075250", "deletions": 14, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "bug-fix", "code-checks-pending", "trk"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 44916, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Phase2 Fast CPE Template Error Fix", "updated_at": "1715075282", "user": "AdrianoDee"}

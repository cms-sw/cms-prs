As is now only `qBin==0` is taken into account and should not be like this. Additionally with https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/44813 this ends up in an infinite loop (that is also how I spotted it). \r\n\r\nBeing the original author I honestly don't remember why this was like this in the first place. One of the hypotheses is that the template for Phase 2 pixels was not available at the time of the CUDA port. But I haven't done all the proper archeology. \r\n\r\nFixes for both for Alpaka and CUDA.\r\n\r\nWill produce the pixel local reco validation plots and append them here.

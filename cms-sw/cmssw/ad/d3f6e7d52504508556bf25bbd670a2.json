For running at the T0 the DQM sequences need to be added to the dmwm/T0/etc/ProdOfflineConfiguration.py configuration for the singleMuon dataset (https://github.com/dmwm/T0/blob/master/etc/ProdOfflineConfiguration.py#L599) and the singleElectron dataset (https://github.com/dmwm/T0/blob/master/etc/ProdOfflineConfiguration.py#L584).\r\n\r\nFor RelVal some changes would be needed as well (probably somewhere in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/Configuration/PyReleaseValidation/python/relval_steps.py#L1566) to run the DQM efficiency calculation only for some MC and data samples.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "comments": 16, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1513787357", "deletions": 25, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-pending", "l1-approved", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_0_X", "number": 21754, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Make separate L1T autoDQM sequences for efficiency measurements", "updated_at": "1515485558", "user": "thomreis"}

Information about other architectures is incomplete or missing due to variations in /proc/cpu, which is what we currently parse to fill in the CPU info.  See #37488 for details.  This PR adds a fallback to the google cpu_features library if the \"model name\" string isn't found in /proc/cpu.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI added two unit tests, one to verify that the cpu_features library is functional, and the second to verify that the CPU service sets a non-empty string for the CPUModels entry in the FJR SystemCPU PerformanceSummary.  Tested on x86-64 and aarch6 (would test on ppc but cvmfs seems to be broken ibmminsky-2 at the moment).", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "comments": 20, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1668195607", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_6_X", "number": 40050, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "open", "title": "Improve cpu feature discover on ppc and aarch64", "updated_at": "1668630435", "user": "dan131riley"}

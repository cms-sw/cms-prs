This PR fixes that by using the same TP selector as for TP DeltaR calculation (being the same as efficiency vs. eta), i.e. essentially requiring that the TP comes from the hard scatter and has pT > 0.9 GeV. In addition, another version of the efficiency summary plot is included without the TP pT cut.\n\nTested in 750pre6, expecting changes only in `effic_vs_coll`, `num_simul_coll`, `num_assoc(simToReco)_coll`, and `globalEfficiencies` under `Tracking/Track` folder. In noPU samples the efficiency plots should change like (black=old, red=new)\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/33993/8374446/b28d6e54-1bf5-11e5-8770-7d5375aca394.png)\n\nand in pileup samples like\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/33993/8374430/8ce7f2c8-1bf5-11e5-97c1-7308acd3d9a7.png)\n\n@rovere @VinInn \n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1435748896", "comments": 2, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1435583108", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "dqm-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 9956, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix MultiTrackValidator efficiency summary plot", "updated_at": "1476956416", "user": "makortel"}

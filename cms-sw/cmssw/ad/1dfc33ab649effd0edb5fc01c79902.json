The dictionaries for the different template instances of this class were split over the Electron/Muon/Photon identification packages. Now, they are all in the `PhysicsTools/SeletorUtils` library.\r\n\r\nThen, there were dictionaries in the 3 identification packages for almost trivial classes used in `VIDSelectorBase.py`. However, these classes are tiny template classes that are only used in said python scipt, so I don't think we need dictionaries for them. The classes are small enough such that including them via `gInterpreter.Declare` is very fast.\r\n\r\nFinally, there was a dictionary produced for the `ElectronMVAEstimatorRun2` class, which I suggest to also not do anymore. There is only one use case for this: the class is used in the `ElectronIdentification/python/FWLite.py` utility file. But again, declaring the `ElectronMVAEstimatorRun2` is very quick (after avoiding some includes), so it's not necessary to generate dictionaries in CMSSW just for this one usecase (which is outdated anyway because FWLite usage is going down since NanoAOD I guess).\r\n\r\nMore information can also be found in the commit messages.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n* CMSSW compiles\r\n* `test_eleid_fwlite.py` runs\r\n* it is still possible to instantiate the Python classes `VIDElectronSelector`, `VIDPhotonSelector`, `VIDMuonSelector`\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nNo backport intended.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 29, "closed_at": "1643099967", "comments": 44, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1635848924", "deletions": 236, "labels": ["core-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-rejected", "orp-approved", "requires-external", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "f88f5083da9cbf8d68c9e56ad1b9bf4b08d0391b", "merged_at": "1643099967", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 35953, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 17, "state": "closed", "title": "Restructure VID Python/FWLite code and avoid generating dictionaries for `Reco*/*Identification` packages", "updated_at": "1643099968", "user": "guitargeek"}

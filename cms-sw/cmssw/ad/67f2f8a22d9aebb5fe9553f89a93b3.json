They are also incompatible with the consumes interface, as the InputTags of consumed data members must be known at construction time.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1426146722", "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1426022891", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["comparison-available", "l1-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "02956d5b23ed75628ca6e34cfac0483a2703ed63", "merged_at": "1426146722", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 8186, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Remove unnecessary and dangerous mutable qualifiers", "updated_at": "1426166001", "user": "wmtan"}

In particular, parameters concerning Fills, Lumisections and also most of the data handled by DIP have been moved to a different storage layout. The direct access on the corresponding Oracle tables has been discouraged in favour of queries made on a new dedicated web service, OMS.\r\n\r\nThis PR aims to re-work the implementation of the LHCInfo O2O workflow, adapting the extraction of the data source to the new indicated service, the OMS.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose a few utility classes have been created:\r\n- A generic Convenience class for query data from a Web function, based on Curl\r\n- A utility class for the specific access on OMS, with several tasks: -form the expected connection string for the required queries; -decoding the JSON string returned by the queries;  -converting the data types as needed for populating the existing data structure\r\n\r\nThe O2O workflow has been adapted and is using these utilities.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nLocal Integration tests \r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 12, "closed_at": "1645197164", "comments": 15, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1644840472", "deletions": 408, "labels": ["alca-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "db-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "f4b2b851451666ad7df3f9c29603ed15d8d22d1a", "merged_at": "1645197164", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 36956, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 7, "state": "closed", "title": "Changing LHCInfo O2O Implementation to access source data from OMS", "updated_at": "1645197165", "user": "ggovi"}

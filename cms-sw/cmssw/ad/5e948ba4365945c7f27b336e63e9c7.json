This was leading to a DQM integrity error plot being mistakenly filled.\r\n\r\nWe have set these values so the bx labels are treated as the same in this scope and avoid incorrectly filling DQM integrity error plots.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe ECAL DQM code was run on an offending dataset and the fake integrity errors disappeared. We also confirmed the results with ECAL DAQ.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nThis is a backport of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/35661 to include it in Online DQM at P5.", "branch": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1634711303", "comments": 15, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1634217397", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "backport-ok"], "merge_commit_sha": "0a2185cdcdaa8af635c917263d19ad1ec449a6a2", "merged_at": "1634711303", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "number": 35674, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 4, "state": "closed", "title": "[backport] Set equivalence of first/last bx labels used by different subsystems in ECAL DQM", "updated_at": "1634711304", "user": "alejands"}

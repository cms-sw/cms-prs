Motivated by a comment in an earlier PR\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/37532#discussion_r862080899\r\n\r\nThis only affects a unit test, nothing more.\r\n\r\nNote the problem was not as large as I originally thought. It only affected two files and only some parts of them. Other parts were already using switch or if else.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe modified unit test still passes.

A new, configurable interface for the geometry of the fastsim tracker was developed. To this end, it was necessary to also write a new algorithm for the propagation of the particles inside the tracker.\r\nThe geometry of the detector used to be hard-coded but can now be specified in a single python file (FastSimulation/Geometry/python/TrackerMaterial_cfi.py)\r\n\r\nMotivation for a new algorithm (particle propagation inside the tracker)\r\n- almost impossible to adjust the old algorithm to the new, configurable geometry (hard-coded links have to be omitted)\r\n- old algorithm is flawed\r\n- the new algorithm allows to put material and instruments on any plane perpendicular to z, or on any cylinder with the z-axis as axis\r\n- while the old algorithm, with the requirement of nested layers, forbids the introduction of long narrow cylinders, required for a decent simulation of material in front of HF\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 129, "comments": 130, "commits": 22, "created_at": "1506503942", "deletions": 479, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "code-checks-pending", "comparison-pending", "core-pending", "dqm-pending", "fastsim-pending", "new-package-pending", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending", "upgrade-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_1_X", "number": 20666, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 68, "state": "open", "title": "New fastsim geometry reb", "updated_at": "1516881494", "user": "skurz"}

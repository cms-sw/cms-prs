There is also a new [Configuration/Geometry/test](https://github.com/kpedro88/cmssw/tree/Phase2-WF12/Configuration/Geometry/test) with a script to generate 2023 geometries automatically. (For the Phase2 Eras, the only difference is caused by the calorimeter content, so I named them `Phase2C1` and `Phase2C2`.)\n\nThe upgrade workflow matrix numbers have been reorganized. This is reflected in all the necessary configuration files.\n\nOther items of note:\n- `run2_common` is now chained into the Phase2 Eras\n- `hbheUpgradeReco` and `hfUpgradeReco` are no longer used as tags; the reco modules themselves are now replaced using `toReplaceWith`, so the usual `hbhereco` and `hfreco` tags for the RecHit collections will continue to work in all downstream reco\n- phase2 validation and DQM sequences are now defined in the autoValidation and autoDQM configs (@davidlange6, let me know if this is what you had in mind)\n- upgrade workflow components are reorganized slightly (@boudoul, let me know if you have any qualms - I just wanted to have one dictionary for everything)\n\nAll the workflows should still run. I demoted the HGCal workflows back to local reco until the cheated reco is fully ready (@lgray is working on the necessary downstream reco changes).\n\nDon't be intimidated by the apparent size of this PR; ~98% of the changes are in Python...\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 56, "closed_at": "1470934903", "comments": 26, "commits": 12, "created_at": "1470684323", "deletions": 567, "labels": ["alca-pending", "comparison-available", "db-pending", "dqm-pending", "geometry-pending", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-pending", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "61055ccf240040fcb0ae4477d7bc9ce28d98742b", "merged_at": "1470934903", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 15393, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "Phase2 workflow revamp", "updated_at": "1470934904", "user": "kpedro88"}

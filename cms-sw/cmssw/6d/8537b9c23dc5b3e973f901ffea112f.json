As such uncertainty depends on particle mass, it has been estimated under each of the three mass hypotheses considered (pion, kaon, proton).\r\nImplementation and use cases were discussed in detail in the following [MTD DPG](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1368740/contributions/5756504/attachments/2783934/4852980/MTD%20DPG%20Meeting%20-%20Propagation%20of%20momentum%20uncertainty%20on%20extrapolated%20time.pdf) meeting.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nThe PR has been tested on workflows 24834.0 TTbar14TeV and 24840.0 MinBias14TeV, producing results consistent with expectations as shown in the presentation above.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 22, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1707400893", "deletions": 19, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "reconstruction-approved", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "upgrade-approved", "code-checks-approved", "mtd"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 43918, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "open", "title": "MTD reconstruction: introduction of mass-dependent uncertainty on track time of flight", "updated_at": "1708404930", "user": "noepalm"}

The core framework of the original producer remains intact, while additional branches are introduced to the NanoAOD output to support the UParT tagger.\r\n\r\n* The default numbers of physics objects are adjusted to reduce the output file size. This adjustment is specific to the BTV group and will not affect other broader users.\r\n\r\n* The support of two new optional environmental variables, CMSSW_NANOAOD_SV_SORT and CMSSW_NANOAOD_PF_SORT, is added to facilitate customized sorting strategies for secondary vertices and particle flow candidates.\r\n\r\nThis PR does not rely on any other pull requests or external resources.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe changes are tested using private scripts as well as following the guidelines in the \"Before Making Your Pull Request\" section at [the webpage](https://cms-sw.github.io/PRWorkflow.html).", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "comments": 10, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1739457559", "deletions": 455, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "xpog-pending", "btv"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 47343, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Reduce and unify tagger inputs", "updated_at": "1739800288", "user": "lyazj"}

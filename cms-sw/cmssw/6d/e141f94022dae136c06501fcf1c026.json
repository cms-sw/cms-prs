The description from the original PR is below:\n\nThis PR fixes the HLTL1NumberFilter used by paths from the HcalNZS primary dataset. The filter was relying on FED 812 always being in the event which is no longer the case since the advent of TCDS. Per Andrea Bocci's suggestion, the FED used has been made configurable with the default set to 813 in fillDescriptions (it's not a good idea to simply change the hardcoded value to 813 because it will break again after the L1 trigger upgrade).\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_3_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1417606419", "comments": 11, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1417402381", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "fully-signed", "hlt-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "b85386baa12dd81d1f26810f1350869841c7b5a2", "merged_at": "1417606419", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_3_X", "number": 6707, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "Making FED used by HLTL1NumberFilter configurable", "updated_at": "1417606419", "user": "avetisya"}

This choice, implemented with the command \"conddb copy --o2oTest\", allows to limit the execution time of the O2O workflow to a reasonable time. However, the present implementation fails when the second-last iov points to a payload produced with a boost release incompatible (=more recent) with the underlying release boost version. Typically, this happening in CMSSW branches that are left behind with respect to the last release used in production for the O2Os.\r\nThis problem is the cause of issue https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/33989\r\n\r\nTo overcome the problem, the o2oTest option of the function conddb copy has been modified, to select the highest iov in the source tag, pointing to a payload with boost version compatible with the underlying CMSSW release.\r\n\r\nThe new implementation fixes the above issue.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 11, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1632814089", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["db-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "number": 35440, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "open", "title": "O2O test setup modified to work across boost version changes", "updated_at": "1632827352", "user": "ggovi"}

Therefore, in order to have all the fast timing information needed it is necessary to make a full new release anyway.\n\nWhile at it, it seemed prudent to bring in the 4D vertex reconstruction as well, as it exists in SLHCDEV. \nI have a person branch that has more developments here, but that can come later.\n\nThis PR is therefore a straight side-port of #11770.\n\nI request that this be merged and a new release be cut, pursuant to the plan for fast timing laid out yesterday in the Upgrade Studies meeting.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "changed_files": 66, "closed_at": "1447424299", "comments": 16, "commits": 52, "created_at": "1446823935", "deletions": 470, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "dqm-pending", "new-package-pending", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "tests-rejected"], "merge_commit_sha": "a538bf029f1afcf28df47386547055ef196a8d3f", "merged_at": "1447424299", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "number": 12290, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Baseline for Hermetic Timing Demo (SLHC)", "updated_at": "1447428172", "user": "lgray"}

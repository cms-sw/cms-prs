The new build rules now do not change any file under cmssw src tree and still allows developers to create/modify `src/SubSystem/Package/python/*.py`  file and use them without re-running `scram build`. \r\n\r\nSide effect of this change is that now cmssw python import paths are `cmssw/src/SubSystem/Package/python/module_cfi.py` instead of `cmssw/python/SubSystem/Package/module_cfi.py` due to which unit test `TestIntegrationParameterSet` is failing. This change should fix the unit test failure for CMSSW_12_4_PY_X IBs.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1652330002", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-rejected", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 37916, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "checkImportPermission: Fix needed due to new build rules", "updated_at": "1652396018", "user": "smuzaffar"}

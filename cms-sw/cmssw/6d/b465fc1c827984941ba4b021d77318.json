The new build rules now do not change any file under cmssw src tree and still allows developers to create/modify `src/SubSystem/Package/python/*.py`  files and use those without re-running `scram build`. \r\n\r\nSide effect of this change is that now cmssw python import paths are `cmssw/src/SubSystem/Package/python/module_cfi.py` instead of `cmssw/python/SubSystem/Package/module_cfi.py` due to which unit test `TestIntegrationParameterSet` is failing. This change should fix the unit test failure for CMSSW_12_4_PY_X IBs.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1652399486", "comments": 10, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1652330002", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-rejected", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "ae952a633cfb40b588e2e2c04f242fd1e8f86cc9", "merged_at": "1652399485", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 37916, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "checkImportPermission: Fix needed due to new build rules", "updated_at": "1652415125", "user": "smuzaffar"}

It does not affect the checksum used.\nAlso, on a different line, spurious trailing spaces are removed to make this file more common with the versions in other releases.\nNote, this PR has no effect whatsoever in this release.  The sole purpose of the new version number is to prevent a version clash with ROOT6 by deterring someone from adding version 33 with a different checksum.\nPlease expedite.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1427773326", "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1427730907", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "12459c6a25e377c77f2ca9a7b21fa5f6a89a7723", "merged_at": "1427773326", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 8599, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "ROOT6 checksums needed in ROOT5", "updated_at": "1427819841", "user": "wmtan"}

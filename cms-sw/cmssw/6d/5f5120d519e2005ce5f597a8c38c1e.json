The controlling script creates a directory in /tmp/ (which will be re-used by later invocations on the same machine), there sets up development areas for the \"reference releases\", \nif needed, copies over (from the IB/devArea) and builds the core code, then invokes the core script to write some conditions into a database for each reference release and the actual IB/devArea. Once the (sqlite) DBs are written, the script loops over all releases (reference and actual IB/devArea) and reads all existing DBs. If any error is found, it exits with -1, otherwise with 0.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1440053839", "comments": 10, "commits": 8, "created_at": "1439533944", "deletions": 13, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "039a2e8c604d67d5d1ab2e0a7be96a3b72163ae4", "merged_at": "1440053839", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 10767, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "First version of a \"unit-test\" like regression test for conditions", "updated_at": "1440053840", "user": "apfeiffer1"}

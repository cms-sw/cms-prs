The focus is on reading from full datasets without reading them from disk entirely.\r\n\r\nSo far there are no usages, but this code might be useful for detector studies on the per-lumi saved data from the UL rereco, Machine Learning studies, and potentially an alternative DQMGUI backend.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nI gave the code a bit of testing but there might still be problems. Now and then ROOT just dies; multi-threading is hard after all. \r\n\r\nProbably we should not merge that until some users confirm it is useful.\r\n\r\n@gbenelli voiced some interest in this.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1588057917", "comments": 33, "commits": 14, "created_at": "1585231623", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 29316, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "DQM: Python DQMIO IO library", "updated_at": "1588057917", "user": "schneiml"}

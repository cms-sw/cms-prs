Now that the MixingModule is a stream producer, there is no need to do the caching explicitly (=vectors indexed by the stream ID). A simple member variable is enough, and it is safe because framework runs always the same instance of a stream module in a given stream.\r\n\r\nThe caching is further simplified to always set the cache variable in `initializeEvent()` and set it back to `nullptr` in `finalizeEvent()` (to prevent the use of the engine outside event, e.g. begin/end lumi/run).\r\n\r\nResolves #22712.\r\n\r\nTested in CMSSW_10_1_0 (rebased on top of CMSSW_10_2_X_2018-04-10-2300), no changes expected.\r\n\r\n@wddgit @Dr15Jones ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 16, "comments": 23, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1523006114", "deletions": 193, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-approved", "upgrade-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 22874, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Simplify caching of CLHEP::HepRandomEngine in digitizers", "updated_at": "1523449422", "user": "makortel"}

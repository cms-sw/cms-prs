The left plot corresponds to the simhit level charge (before ageing) and the right plot corresponds to the reconstructed charge including noise and ageing. The nominal threshold for TOA measurement is 12 fC. Without the fix all simulated hits with 12 fC will generate TOA, however after ageing they'll correspond to <12 fC which is an unwanted behavior. After the fix one can observe that the sharp threshold is now at 12 fC at reconstruction level and depicts a slow rise at sim hit level.\r\n\r\n![qspectra_toa](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4624574/228843094-dbd938a4-d792-406d-bbbd-d38a861d8a1a.png)\r\n\r\nThe TOA efficiency curves are below\r\n\r\n![toaeff](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4624574/228843096-89d5d467-439d-40d5-89d6-c6d5614b8771.png)\r\n\r\nThe patch generates a different number of calls to the random number generator and thus a smearing in the digis. This is illustrated below for CE-H, CE-H Si and SiPM-on-tile sections. However the result is expected to be unbiased with respect to previous releases\r\n\r\n| Section      | Migration of DIGIs expected after PR |\r\n| ----------- | ----------- |\r\n| CE-E | ![adcperdetid_0](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4624574/228843008-74691d9c-6166-4fb3-bcef-54d443ef8f98.png) |\r\n| CE-H Si | ![adcperdetid_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4624574/228843017-bf74fa7b-8cf5-4f19-a819-a6b2c35b9d99.png) |\r\n| CE-H SiPM-on-tile | ![adcperdetid_2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4624574/228843024-bef6465b-b3df-45e8-8e86-12135ff8a174.png) |\r\n\r\n#### References\r\n\r\n[1]  https://indico.cern.ch/event/1270358/#2-update-on-toa-studies", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 2, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1680174203", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["simulation-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_1_X", "number": 41234, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Re-inforce time of arrival threshold in aged scenarios", "updated_at": "1680174964", "user": "pfs"}

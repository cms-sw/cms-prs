The code automatically reads these channels once a new emap is loaded.\r\n\r\nThe code only extends the histogram booking for additional EM channels, and excludes these channels from being filled in the sums. Hence, the only change will be in the addition of the 6 EM channels to the DQM w/o modifying the content of all the rest (including sums).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis PR was validated using the procedure described in the dropbox ([here](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Check-of-FSC-DQM--CpS1rGdupheE5gK0JoMFoanEAQ-Gn5IVBXzUSeqxIZbiAjkK)) and using the online playback.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

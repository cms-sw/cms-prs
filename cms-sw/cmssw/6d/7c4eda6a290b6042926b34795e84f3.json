In particular, the run3_GEM modifier chain in RecoLocalMuon/Configuration/python/RecoLocalMuon_EventContent_cff.py. Could someone clarify if my understanding is correct but this is expected (it appears the change to Repack.py was made 2 months ago?), or if not expected is the fix okay and should I backport this? Otherwise let me know if my understanding is wrong.\r\n\r\n@jshlee \r\n@slowmoyang \r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with a description of the feature proposed or problem addressed, specifying:\r\n  - what changes are expected in the output if any, \r\n  - what other PRs or externals it depends upon if any,\r\n  - link to any additional material useful to provide a documentation for this PR (slides, JIRA tickets, related pull requestes, hypernews, TWiki or Indico pages)  -->\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nChecked the output of Configuration/DataProcessing/test/RunPromptReco.py with ppEra_Run3 scenario before and after the change:\r\n\r\nbefore the local muon content looks like:\r\n```\r\n    'keep *_dt4DSegments_*_*',\r\n    'keep *_dt4DCosmicSegments_*_*',\r\n    'keep *_cscSegments_*_*',\r\n    'keep *_rpcRecHits_*_*'\r\n```\r\nafter:\r\n```\r\n    'keep *_dt4DSegments_*_*',\r\n    'keep *_dt4DCosmicSegments_*_*',\r\n    'keep *_cscSegments_*_*',\r\n    'keep *_rpcRecHits_*_*',\r\n    'keep *_gemRecHits_*_*',\r\n    'keep *_gemSegments_*_*'\r\n```\r\n\r\nI used the command ```python3 ${CMSSW_BASE}/src/Configuration/DataProcessing/test/RunPromptReco.py \\\r\n    --scenario=ppEra_Run3 \\\r\n    --global-tag=123X_dataRun3_Prompt_v12 \\\r\n    --reco --aod \\\r\n    --lfn /store/whatever\r\n```\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with a description of which tests have been performed to verify the correctness of the PR, including the eventual addition of new code for testing like unit tests, test configurations, additions or updates to the runTheMatrix test workflows -->\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

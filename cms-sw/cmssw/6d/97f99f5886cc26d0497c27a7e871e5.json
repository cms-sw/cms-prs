Theano finds it and\r\nattemps to use it.\r\n\r\nBy default force theano to use only CPU backend. Note, that by default\r\nOpenMP is also disabled thus not disabled explicitly.\r\n\r\nAlso theano has a compilation cache, which by default is in your home\r\ndirectory. This avoid writing directly and create a temporary directory\r\nfor the cache. It is constantly deleted.\r\n\r\nThis might solve random failures in IBs.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: David Abdurachmanov <David.Abdurachmanov@cern.ch>", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1513280418", "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1513241053", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "orp-approved", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "de802a49c51a9de347acc69739fc21ac174dc030", "merged_at": "1513280418", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_0_X", "number": 21709, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 4, "state": "closed", "title": "Improve theano tests", "updated_at": "1513280418", "user": "davidlt"}

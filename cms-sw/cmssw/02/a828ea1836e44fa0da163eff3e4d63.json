This purely technical request fixes those packages.  In one place, I also changed two includes of ROOT headers to use quotes instead of angle brackets, as they are not system headers.\n\nPlease bypass signatures, as this is purely technical. \n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 11, "closed_at": "1379445846", "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1379430172", "deletions": 19, "labels": ["alca-pending", "analysis-pending", "core-approved", "db-pending", "dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "ab517424ca469412eaef5438c5245e4d442b224e", "merged_at": "1379445846", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_0_0_pre5", "number": 867, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add more missing std qualifiers and includes of iostream header", "updated_at": "1406187491", "user": "wmtan"}

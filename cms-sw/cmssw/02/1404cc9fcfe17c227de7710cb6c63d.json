For hltd to properly collect and merge the dqm histogram stream produced by the HLT, it needs a init file to be written.  Otherwise the stream is ignored and at best the histograms are lost. \r\n\r\nThis PR adds that code.  It should have no effect on any offline test, this only effects P5 running.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe hilton tests successfully produced the DQM Histogram stream.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1590040914", "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1589989665", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "c8043d3b14ceda4bbb955cc05fabe3adfc9d3c24", "merged_at": "1590040914", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 29924, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fixing online behaviour of DQMFileSaverPB", "updated_at": "1590040914", "user": "Sam-Harper"}

The solution implemented before to avoid it could cause a clash with eventual user redefinition of es_sources to access LHCInfo DB. For the time being, it was changed to use nominal optics while a better solution is not ready.\r\n\r\nThis PR is required to  unhold  PR #29916\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nscram b runtests           -> Ok\r\nscram b code-checks   -> Ok\r\nscram b code-format   -> Ok\r\n\r\nrunTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos  \r\n               ---->  36 35 33 26 16 4 1 1 1 tests passed, 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 failed\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with any link to  -->\r\n\r\nBefore submitting your pull requests, make sure you followed this checklist:\r\n- verify that the PR is really intended for the chosen branch\r\n- verify that changes follow [CMS Naming, Coding, And Style Rules](http://cms-sw.github.io/cms_coding_rules.html)\r\n- verify that the PR passes the basic test procedure suggested in the [CMSSW PR instructions](https://cms-sw.github.io/PRWorkflow.html)\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 11, "closed_at": "1592808628", "comments": 11, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1592478334", "deletions": 223, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "dfbc77b37685de7b9072e188b2788a1ef7d904b3", "merged_at": "1592808628", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 30290, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Update of  SimTransport/PPSProtonTransport for Run 3", "updated_at": "1592808629", "user": "mundim"}

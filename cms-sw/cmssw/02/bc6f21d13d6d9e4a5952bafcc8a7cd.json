All algorithms from the rich `FastJet` libraries could be tested using different configurations.\r\nA `processModifier` has been added to allow the end-user to enable this plugin. The modifier is called `fastJetTICL`.\r\nThe modifier has been added in such a way that all the validation plots for the Tracksters produced by the `FastJet` pattern recognition will be automatically produced.\r\nAt present jets are translated into `Tracksters`. As a future development, if needed, we could save also the reconstructed `jets`.\r\nIt would be nice to have this code integrated into the release, even if not bundled to any official workflow, to allow interested people to develop on top of that.\r\n\r\nYou can find some more information about its `performance` (it's quite hard to call them as such, as of yet...)

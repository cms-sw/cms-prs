In the constructor of the base class `CSCGEMMotherboard` the variable `chamber` is used to reset the processor. This needs to be  `theChamber` instead which refers to the physical chamber number, not the trigger chamber number. Without the fix the upgrade motherboards do not produce coincidence pads.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI tested this fix with workflow 22034.0.\r\n\r\n@tahuang1991", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1568789097", "comments": 14, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1568061678", "deletions": 9, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "746d371a7a1a33fb101044aeb02ca329b229af2c", "merged_at": "1568789097", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27958, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix mix-up between the physical and the trigger chamber number in upgrade CSC motherboard", "updated_at": "1568789097", "user": "dildick"}

This PR supports this option by adding a new template to `TrackerAlignmentCompareAll` in order to limit the number of IDs looked at (if `doOnlyPixel` those that have subdetId > 2 are discarded). \r\nAlso added a unit test for the functionality.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nPrivately run the unit test, successfully. \r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

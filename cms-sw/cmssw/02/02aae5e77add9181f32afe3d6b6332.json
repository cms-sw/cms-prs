Please see plots in the [link](https://coli.web.cern.ch/coli/validation/mt-v2/LHE/nanoplot/). See [here](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/WorkBookGenMultithread#Internal_multithreading_for_MG5) for the configuration to activate this utility.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1626409313", "comments": 15, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1625900748", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "generators-pending", "orp-approved", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "61412385be6be6c1be2c09444e8561c22a3c98d8", "merged_at": "1626409313", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "number": 34437, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix the MadGraph5 LO multithread utility", "updated_at": "1626409314", "user": "colizz"}

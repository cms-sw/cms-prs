There was a subtle bug that only the first EncodedEventId was stored. Another bug has also been fixed where the fraction of individual contribution to the digi was calculated wrongly. A few new histograms are added in the validation suite and a few minor bugs corrected\r\n\r\nDetailed description of the update reported in Tracker Phase2 Simulation meeting can be found here\r\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/536892/contributions/2385404/attachments/1379749/2096939/DigiStudy_Status_Nov29_2016.pdf\r\n\r\n@delaere @atricomi @boudoul @emiglior @kpedro88", "branch": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "changed_files": 12, "closed_at": "1481289308", "comments": 16, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1481019374", "deletions": 157, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "b8897a71024008f20f88718870387324d741733f", "merged_at": "1481289308", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "number": 16884, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "Update of Phase2Digitizer package", "updated_at": "1481289308", "user": "suchandradutta"}

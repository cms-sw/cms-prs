I'll try and split these down by package to make them easier to integrate.  This one is for the digitisation.\n\nThere should be no change whatsoever unless the `Run2_2017` era is active (the only top-level era that contains `phase1Pixel`).\n\nThe change to the import in the pixelDigitizer_cfi.py file is for technical reasons, otherwise the pileup dependent inefficiency is not applied.  Depending on how #12256 pans out this might be able to be removed (will do that later though).\n\n**Tests might fail until the next IB** - requires #12254 which has only just been merged.  Not sure if the relevant commit will be included automatically.\n\n@boudoul, @atricomi\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1447309887", "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1446738297", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "5d518a724d6213911f1f5bd964c3206e06868ef7", "merged_at": "1447309887", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 12275, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "phase1Pixel era digitisation additions", "updated_at": "1447369962", "user": "mark-grimes"}

This step was seen to cause a large fake rate that was problematic for jet reconstruction in central events.  The required MVA value is simply required to be slightly higher to curtail the amount of fake tracks. This change is needed for a reRECO of the jet-triggered data.  \r\n\r\nA PR for the master branch will follow shortly.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nMore information on the effects of this change can be found in the presentation that was shown at the XEB meeting today:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/j4ej3pc7tdroy4p/HI-PAG_FakeJets_20190318.pptx?dl=0#\r\n\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\n\r\nBefore submitting your pull requests, make sure you followed this checklist:\r\n- verify that the PR is really intended for the chosen branch\r\n- verify that changes follow [CMS Naming, Coding, And Style Rules](http://cms-sw.github.io/cms_coding_rules.html)\r\n- verify that the PR passes the basic test procedure suggested in the [CMSSW PR instructions](https://cms-sw.github.io/PRWorkflow.html)\r\n\r\n@icali @mandrenguyen @echapon \r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_10_3_X", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 0, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1553007203", "deletions": 1, "labels": [], "number": 26216, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Tweaked pixel pair MVA selection for pp_on_AA", "updated_at": "1553007226", "user": "abaty"}

This is way there is not the danger of too many merge conflicts, we change only one file and it should be relatively quick to review.\r\n\r\nValidation plots for all photon ID value maps:\r\nhttps://rembserj.web.cern.ch/rembserj/plots/CMSSW_PRs/25372/\r\n  * target: CMSSW_10_2_6 plus this PR and the external PR\r\n  * reference: CMSSW_10_4_X_2018-12-03-1100\r\n\r\nValidation workflow:\r\n  * Dump all relevant ID value maps to ROOT file with this configuration [1], running on DY+Jets\r\n  * Compare ROOT file from reference and target with this script [2]\r\n\r\nDepends on cms-sw/cmsdist#4518.\r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/guitargeek/cmssw/blob/EgammaID_validation/RecoEgamma/EgammaTools/test/testPhotonIDs_cfg.py\r\n[2] https://github.com/guitargeek/cmssw/blob/EgammaID_validation/RecoEgamma/EgammaTools/test/photon_validation_10_2_6.py", "branch": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "changed_files": 31, "comments": 31, "commits": 10, "created_at": "1543493763", "deletions": 737, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "requires-external", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 25372, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 11, "state": "open", "title": "[10_2_X] Fall17 V2 Photon ID and PhotonIDValueMapProducer speedup", "updated_at": "1544087298", "user": "guitargeek"}

Here, I suggest to simply synchronize the PhotonIDValueMapProducer (and required new header files) with master to get the speedup.\r\n\r\nValidation plots for all photon ID value maps:\r\nhttps://rembserj.web.cern.ch/rembserj/plots/CMSSW_PRs/25372/\r\n  * target: CMSSW_10_2_6 plus this PR and the external PR\r\n  * reference: CMSSW_10_4_X_2018-12-03-1100 and CMSSW_10_2_6\r\n\r\nValidation workflow:\r\n  * Dump all relevant ID value maps to ROOT file with this configuration [1], running on DY+Jets\r\n  * Compare ROOT file from reference and target with this script [2]\r\n\r\nDepends on cms-sw/cmsdist#4518.\r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/guitargeek/cmssw/blob/f76b6a2c9425d5ad5df91df5ef04272d0ab40e39/RecoEgamma/EgammaTools/test/testPhotonIDs_cfg.py\r\n[2] https://github.com/guitargeek/cmssw/blob/f76b6a2c9425d5ad5df91df5ef04272d0ab40e39/RecoEgamma/EgammaTools/test/photon_validation_10_2_6.py", "branch": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "changed_files": 31, "comments": 46, "commits": 12, "created_at": "1543493763", "deletions": 741, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-pending", "dqm-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "requires-external", "tests-pending", "xpog-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 25372, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 13, "state": "open", "title": "[10_2_X] Fall17 V2 Photon ID and PhotonIDValueMapProducer speedup", "updated_at": "1544511346", "user": "guitargeek"}

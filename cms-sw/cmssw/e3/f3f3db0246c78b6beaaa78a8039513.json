This is way there is not the danger of too many merge conflicts, we change only one file and it should be relatively quick to review.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? @peruzzim \r\n\r\nDepends on #25347 and cms-sw/cmsdist#4518.", "branch": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "changed_files": 31, "comments": 23, "commits": 10, "created_at": "1543493763", "deletions": 737, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "requires-external", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 25372, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 11, "state": "open", "title": "[10_2_X] Fall17 V2 Photon ID and PhotonIDValueMapProducer speedup", "updated_at": "1543912478", "user": "guitargeek"}

And it make a segmentation fault during the test.\r\n* To avoid the problem, we asked the module to check GE+2/1 chamber 16 layer 2 which is in the geometry since 2022 instead of the ghost chamber.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n* The change is tested with the customized geometry which is basically 2023 geometry, but changing gem21 to 2024 scenario.\r\n* The code format passed with `scram b code-format` and `scram b code-checks`\r\n\r\n@watson-ij @bsunanda \r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

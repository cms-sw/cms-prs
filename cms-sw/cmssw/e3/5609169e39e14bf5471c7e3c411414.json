(The interface is similar to the ONNX GPU support one https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/36963)\r\n\r\nThe GPU session can be activate by user code by requesting `tensorflow::Backend::cuda` in the session creation. \r\nThis is needed to be able to compile TF with GPU support in the cmssw-dist (see https://github.com/cms-sw/cmsdist/pull/7648).\r\n\r\nBy default the CPU backend is used for all the standard workflows. \r\n\r\nTests have been modified to run both a CPU and a GPU version, if a device is available. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation \r\nWe are working to provide a test with GPU backend. \r\n\r\n\r\n@yongbinfeng @riga  @tvami @smuzaffar ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 13, "comments": 37, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1673974214", "deletions": 41, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "hold", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "number": 40551, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Add GPU backend option for TensorFlow session", "updated_at": "1675182952", "user": "valsdav"}

All plots now require passing at least one of the configured (muon) triggers and jets further require that no HLT object is within &Delta;R of 0.3 of the selected L1T jet.\r\n\r\nSince the handling of HLT objects will be useful for another issue as well as other modules, I've extracted the functionality into a separate module, `L1TCommon`.\r\nIn addition:\r\n - adjusted configuration names for trigger variables\r\n - extended trigger list as suggested in the Jira issue\r\n - renamed 'turn-ons' to 'efficiencies' in comments\r\n\r\n\r\nLooking forward to the feedback.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "comments": 14, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1515600361", "deletions": 21, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "dqm-pending", "l1-approved", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_0_X", "number": 21822, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 5, "state": "open", "title": "[10X] [L1T] [DQM] Enabling trigger selection for Jets and Sums", "updated_at": "1515663591", "user": "kreczko"}

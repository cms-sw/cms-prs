This was seen, for instance, in collisions run 275766, where the Emulation Quality continued to show YELLOW\n- To protect against these cases (without tightening the 5 sigma constraint), if threshold occupancy < 0, set threshold occupancy to 10.\n\nIn conjunction with 81X PR https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/14979.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1467126853", "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1466842194", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "94ac8c18baa6637e10eef7e2161a49ffc2581518", "merged_at": "1467126853", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 14978, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Protect against negative occupancy thresholds", "updated_at": "1467126853", "user": "mbandrews"}

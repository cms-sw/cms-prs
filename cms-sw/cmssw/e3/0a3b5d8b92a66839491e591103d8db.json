To avoid redefinition errors, most of the L1T modules and the offline beamspot module are dropped from this configuration.\r\n\r\nThe HLT configuration is based on\r\n  - `CMSSW_11_1_8`, forward-ported as-is to `CMSSW_12_1_0_pre3\r\n  - global tag [`111X_mcRun4_realistic_T15_v5`](https://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/list/Prod/gts/111X_mcRun4_realistic_T15_v5)\r\n  - the Tracking v6.1 baseline configuration\r\n  - the TICL v3 configuration\r\n\r\nand implement the baseline Phase-2 configuration for Jets/MET, b-tagging, Muons and E/Gamma.\r\nTaus are not included.\r\n\r\nIt includes \"open\" or \"MC\" HLT paths for running the reconstruction without any (pre)selection applied, and a partial re-emulation of the Level-1 Trigger, which simulates a simplified L1T menu using EDFilters and Paths.\r\n\r\nBarring the changes in release and conditions, for Jets/MET and B-tagging the results obtained for the TDR correspond to the commit 38d7327 (and likely also with a6692af, which is just a technical fix), which still use \"offline\" muons for the Particle Flow reconstruction.\r\nThe following commits implement the use of HLT muons in the Particle Flow reconstruction, affecting the Jets/MET (and likely B-tagging) performance in a non-negligible way; for more details see [this presentation](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1035816/contributions/4350085/subcontributions/337175/attachments/2242877/3803185/210511_hltupg_val32903.pdf).\r\n\r\nFor Muons, E/Gamma, and overall timing measurements, the results obtained in the TDR correspond to the full PR.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTo be done.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nForward port of #32903.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1518, "comments": 9, "commits": 11, "created_at": "1632138114", "deletions": 16, "labels": ["hlt-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-rejected", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 35342, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Phase 2 HLT menu targetting 7.510 cms", "updated_at": "1646982102", "user": "fwyzard"}

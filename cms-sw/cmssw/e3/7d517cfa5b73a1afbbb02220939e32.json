This is configured by a combination of python flags (with a corresponding new `run2_HF_2016` sub-era) and database conditions (the new `QIEType` flag, see #12473, #12905, #13004). The QIE10 digi collection will be stored for private studies, but it will not be used for 2016 RECO.\n\nThis should have no impact on existing workflows. It will only be activated in combination with the Extended2016 geometry in #13139, related changes in #13205, and an upcoming PR from @bsunanda for some minor related simulation changes. There will also be database changes needed, which will be forthcoming (current tests have used customized hardcode conditions to simulate the necessary conditions).\n\nSome QIE10 features are not available yet:\n1. TDC simulation\n2. PreMixDigis functionality\n3. Some zero suppression-related functions\nHowever, for 2016 we only need to keep the RAW data from the QIE10s, so these features can be implemented later (targeted for 2017).\n\nAttention: @abdoulline, @bsunanda, @jmmans, @awhitbeck\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 46, "closed_at": "1455767200", "comments": 80, "commits": 21, "created_at": "1455032128", "deletions": 83, "labels": ["alca-pending", "comparison-available", "db-pending", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-pending", "tests-rejected"], "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 13232, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 29, "state": "closed", "title": "HF QIE10 for 2016", "updated_at": "1455779349", "user": "kpedro88"}

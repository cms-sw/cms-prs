These are no longer required for any purpose, but still consume ~10% of Phase 2 reconstruction CPU time in 200PU.\r\n\r\nThis PR should be followed up by a reassessment of the usage of `TrackTimeValueMapProducer`, which provides the time smearing inputs (and, in principle, is no longer actually used anywhere).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRan workflow 20434.0 successfully.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1574628322", "comments": 15, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1574367729", "deletions": 22, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "e5457a06ba8b212aa3f9d6ed45126103cc03e0ce", "merged_at": "1574628322", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 28446, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "remove MTD 'fastsim' modules", "updated_at": "1574628322", "user": "kpedro88"}

A trailing _ is the preferred method to distinguish a data member from the getter method\r\n* 6.3 Only header files that expose a public interface should go into the Package/Subpackage/interface directory.\r\n\r\nBesides this, \r\n* some variable names were changed (more descriptive name), \r\n* French comments were translated to English (if that's incorrect let me know...)\r\n* Spelling mistakes were fixed (`Reccord`)\r\n* Tried to reduce code duplication\r\n* Removed commented out code\r\n\r\nChanges are just cosmetics, so no changes in the tests are expected.\r\n\r\nAfter this merges, I have a follow-up with some real changes included.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n` scram b runtests` runs fine (except for the case when I have file opening errors)\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nN/A", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 15, "comments": 14, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1647219659", "deletions": 241, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "hlt-pending", "alca-pending", "fastsim-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 37231, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 8, "state": "open", "title": "Style changes in `RecoTracker/DeDx`", "updated_at": "1647354489", "user": "tvami"}

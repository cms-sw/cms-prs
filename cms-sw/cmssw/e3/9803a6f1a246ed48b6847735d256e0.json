Moved all code related to stubs to Validation/SiTrackerPhase2V/plugins/Phase2OTValidateStub.cc and created Validation/SiTrackerPhase2V/plugins/Phase2OTHarvestStub.cc to keep all stub related code together and separate from L1Tracks code. Renamed necessary files to better describe what is being done in that particular code. Summary of histograms added for extended collection can be found [here](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1555122/contributions/6548463/attachments/3080726/5461274/DQM_Extended_Collection_Histograms.pdf).\r\n\r\nAlso included in this PR, code changes that ljuckett made to create histograms that include vectors for easier reading and remove redundancy.\r\n\r\nIn DQM/SiTrackerPhase2, fixed bug related to PS strip histogram, see slides 2 and 3 of this [talk](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1555122/contributions/6548463/attachments/3080726/5453258/DQMOfflineSoftwareMeeting_6_4_25.pdf).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nscram build code-checks\r\nscram build code-format", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 15, "comments": 10, "commits": 16, "created_at": "1749475959", "deletions": 2165, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved", "trk"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 48275, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 11, "state": "open", "title": "L1 Track Extended Collection for Phase2OT added to Validation Package", "updated_at": "1750328542", "user": "brandiskip"}

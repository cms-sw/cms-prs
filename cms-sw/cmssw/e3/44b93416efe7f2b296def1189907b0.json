For detailed studies we need to write out the pre-triggers to the ROOT file. Tao suggested to add the `CSCCLCTPreTriggerDigi` in dataformats. These `CSCCLCTPreTriggerDigi` will not be used anywhere else (neither in the CSC trigger or CSC DAQ code). But they are essential to understand the trigger and DAQ rates in Run-3 and Phase-2 when GEMs come online.\r\n\r\nFor now, `CSCCLCTPreTriggerDigi` is the same as `CSCCLCTDigi`, but in the future we probably want to extend the dataformat with a list of half-strips that participated in the pre-trigger. For this reason we did not want to re-use the `CSCCLCTDigi` object.\r\n\r\nI also added a template function in `CSCTriggerPrimitivesBuilder` which removes a lot of code-duplication.\r\n\r\n@tahuang1991 @ptcox FYI", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 10, "closed_at": "1518592609", "comments": 25, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1517364898", "deletions": 308, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "5bd603b1d54942bf4039c763daa71424a4c95765", "merged_at": "1518592609", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_1_X", "number": 22049, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "New feature: CSC CLCT pre-trigger digi object in CSC L1 trigger emulator", "updated_at": "1518592609", "user": "dildick"}

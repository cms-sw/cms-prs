Existing upper case entries are kept for back-ward compatibility with previous CMSSW releases.\r\n- On the conddb command line tools, we add the _query_ function to get information about the main data model objects: Tag, Global Tag and Payload. In particular, the _query -p_ function on payloads, will provide information about the boost version used for the serialization.\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nStand-alone test and unit tests\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1622498543", "comments": 7, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1622093200", "deletions": 47, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "db-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "74498b6a54a5f8fac598cda526abcd6325446326", "merged_at": "1622498543", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "number": 33859, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Improvements in conddb tools", "updated_at": "1622498543", "user": "ggovi"}

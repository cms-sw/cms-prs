{"additions": 535, "auther_ref": "EMTF_PR_2018_10_1X_whitespace", "auther_sha": "293293eb233b8ef063a20002bfb210030de923f1", "author": "abrinke1", "body": "Hi all,\r\n\r\nThis is part 1 of a series of PRs (4 or 5 total) which will bring the EMTF emulator up-to-date for 2018 running.  In particular, changes will include:\r\n\r\n  * Improved code style\r\n  * Logic cleanup for EMTF emulator in <= 2017\r\n  * Features in emulator to match EMTF firmware at start-of-2018\r\n  * Ability to process additional simulated TPs (e.g. from GEMs and ME0) through the EMTF emulator, with output in a consistent format with TPs from the existing CSCs and RPCs.  This feature is critical for Run 3 and Phase II studies.\r\n\r\nTo facilitate and speed up the review process, I have split Jia Fu's PR here (https://github.com/cms-l1t-offline/cmssw/pull/649) into logical, independent parts as much as possible.  That said, some changes cannot be disentangled, so there will be some unavoidable cross-over, for example between updates for start-of-2018 and the Phase-II TP processing.\r\n\r\nThis PR is very simple - it is just corrections to whitespace, e.g. cleaning up leading and trailing whitespace in lines.  This can be verified by adding \"?w=1\" to the end of the PR diff path as follows:\r\nhttps://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/22820/files?w=1\r\n\r\n(HT to @jiafulow for that.). Hopefully we can get this in quite quickly, and move on to the next step. @rekovic , @thomreis please take a look.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nAndrew\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 39, "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1522663229", "deletions": 533, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "l1-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 22820, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "EMTF April 2018 emulator update part 1 - whitespace cleanup", "updated_at": "1522663420", "user": "abrinke1"}

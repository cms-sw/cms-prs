In particular, changes will include:\r\n\r\n  * Improved code style\r\n  * Logic cleanup for EMTF emulator in <= 2017\r\n  * Features in emulator to match EMTF firmware at start-of-2018\r\n  * Ability to process additional simulated TPs (e.g. from GEMs and ME0) through the EMTF emulator, with output in a consistent format with TPs from the existing CSCs and RPCs.  This feature is critical for Run 3 and Phase II studies.\r\n\r\nTo facilitate and speed up the review process, I have split Jia Fu's PR here (https://github.com/cms-l1t-offline/cmssw/pull/649) into logical, independent parts as much as possible.  That said, some changes cannot be disentangled, so there will be some unavoidable cross-over, for example between updates for start-of-2018 and the Phase-II TP processing.\r\n\r\nThis PR is very simple - it is just corrections to whitespace, e.g. cleaning up leading and trailing whitespace in lines.  This can be verified by adding \"?w=1\" to the end of the PR diff path as follows:\r\nhttps://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/22820/files?w=1\r\n\r\n(HT to @jiafulow for that.). Hopefully we can get this in quite quickly, and move on to the next step. @rekovic , @thomreis please take a look.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nAndrew\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 39, "closed_at": "1522819415", "comments": 12, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1522663229", "deletions": 533, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "f35b32c499059d9ce31e0060d4543bf8a12e9efc", "merged_at": "1522819415", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 22820, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "EMTF April 2018 emulator update part 1 - whitespace cleanup", "updated_at": "1522819416", "user": "abrinke1"}

Currently the |eta| cut is hard-coded in the `.cc` file and it is |eta|<2.5. This is a problem for e/gamma's PF electron ID DNN training targeting eta-extended electrons (in the region 2.5 < |eta| < 3.0) for Run3. The eta-extended electrons were introduced by https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/35309 and now we are trying to provide a meaningful PF ID for them. While retraining the PF electron ID for these high eta electrons, we figured out that QCD b/c->e samples are all restricted to |eta|<2.5. We would like to improve it for 12_4 so that the MC samples produced with 12_4 release are more appropriate for our use-case. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nI wanted to test by running the following workflows, which looks like the only ones available using b/c->e filter.\r\n`4007.0 QCD_Pt_30_80_BCtoE_8TeV+DIGIPU1+RECOPUDBG`\r\n`4008.0 QCD_Pt_80_170_BCtoE_8TeV+DIGIPU1+RECOPUDBG`\r\nBut they did not run due to `FileOpenError`. \r\n\r\nSo I tested locally by doing this:\r\n`cmsDriver.py Configuration/Generator/python/egm.py  --fileout file:step1.root --mc --eventcontent GEN --datatier GEN-SIM-RAW --conditions auto:phase1_2021_realistic --beamspot Run3RoundOptics25ns13TeVLowSigmaZ --step GEN,SIM -n 100  --geometry DB:Extended --era Run3 --python_filename bctoe.py --no_exec --customise Configuration/DataProcessing/Utils.addMonitoring`\r\n\r\nwhere `Configuration/Generator/python/egm.py` is this file: \r\nhttps://swmukher.web.cern.ch/swmukher/egm.py\r\n\r\nand then `cmsRun bctoe.py` \r\n\r\nIt ran fine. \r\n\r\nThis PR is not a backport.

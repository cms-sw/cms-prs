Use reserve for vectors of candidates (see #37717)\r\n2. Avoid creating/filling reco objects unnecessarily in `useExistingWeights` case (based on #27929)\r\n3. Avoid use of unnecessary candidate vector and temporary object in `useExistingWeights` case (based on #28033)\r\n\r\nIn my test of the `useExistingWeights` case (on a UL17 ttbar sample), the combination of these three changes reduced the CPU usage of `PuppiProducer` by 50%.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles and runs. CPU impact quantified with igprof. Compared AK8 jet pT in a ttbar workflow to confirm that no changes occurred.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nSee above. Reason: to speed up ultra-legacy analysis processing.\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 12, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1651089876", "deletions": 145, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "jetmet"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 37718, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Backport Puppi speedups [10_6_X]", "updated_at": "1652167950", "user": "kpedro88"}

Moreover, the methods Glued() and Stack() returns the DetId of the double module itself.\n- get the step3 run into the new geometry.\n\nIn order to do the second point three steps are needed:\n1) fixing the Geometric Tracker Search introducing the stack concept and removing the DetsBrother\n2) building the TrackerGeometry with a new GeomDet, which is StackGeomDet\n3) adding in MeasurementTracker the possibility to build TkStackMeasurementDets\n\nMoreover, the two cfg files that produces the clusters have been changed, just to temporary fix the workflow - another PR is requested to @thomaslenzi to fix it definitively.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_6_2_SLHCDEV_X", "changed_files": 46, "closed_at": "1447323410", "comments": 24, "commits": 9, "created_at": "1447081506", "deletions": 473, "labels": ["alca-pending", "comparison-pending", "geometry-pending", "new-package-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "1186e3a3e1e81ec4b10fe531bff512c054d6fd4a", "merged_at": "1447323410", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_6_2_SLHCDEV_X", "number": 12321, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Introducing Stacks in CMSSW geometry (part II)", "updated_at": "1447323946", "user": "ebrondol"}

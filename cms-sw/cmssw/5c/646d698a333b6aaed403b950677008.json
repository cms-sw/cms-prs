By default this is switched to `False`, so in normal conditions this addition is completely transparent to the validation procedure.\r\nThis has been shown to be useful to cross-check the scrutiny of the Full-Track validation of the alignment payload at this [Hypernews thread](https://hypernews.cern.ch/HyperNews/CMS/get/calibrations/3668/1/1/2/2.html).\r\nSee here an example of output validation plot obtained for run 31766 either in standard conditions, forcing the vertex fit with the BS from DB prior to re-computation of BS with the new alignment and forcing the vertex fit with the updated BS. \r\n\r\n![biasescanvas_run316766forced_old_bs_vs_forced_new_bs_vs_standard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5082376/40919596-3e6a0366-680a-11e8-8ca2-02b63890ce1a.png)\r\n\r\nI profit of this PR also to update the initialization file of the all-in-one meta-data tool adding links to the twiki documentation.", "branch": "CMSSW_10_1_X", "changed_files": 8, "closed_at": "1528804941", "comments": 11, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1528113640", "deletions": 22, "labels": ["alca-approved", "backport-ok", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "2e1ab65a5fc4df09144d9c542be064dd5754f1d3", "merged_at": "1528804941", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_1_X", "number": 23456, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "[10.1.X] Add switch to contrain vertex refit to BeamSpot in Alignment PV Validation", "updated_at": "1528804941", "user": "mmusich"}

This PR changes this to use the order on the input tracks (assuming the tracking ntuple preserved that order).\r\n    - This order is straightforward for the seed and cmssw tracks. \r\n    - For sim tracks there could still be odd cases where one simhit corresponds to multiple rechits. Note that the tracking ntuple orders sim hits by increasing time of flight per tracking particle; if a tracking particle is an aggregate of multiple Geant sim tracks things can get complicated.\r\n- fill a correct cluster size in the OT phase 2 using `ph2_clustSize`\r\n- technical: use `Hit::kHitCCCFilterIdx` instead of explicit `-9` (and a ) in the corresponding hit handling code\r\n\r\nNo changes are expected in the standard/matrix/relval workflows", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 7, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1757952436", "deletions": 102, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "tracking"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_0_X", "number": 48932, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "mkfit standalone bin file writer updates: track hit order and phase-2 OT cluster size", "updated_at": "1758000932", "user": "slava77"}

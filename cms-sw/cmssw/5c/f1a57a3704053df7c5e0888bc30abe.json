Following @lveldere's comment https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/12542#discussion_r45774848, the \"slim\" and validation sequences are removed (and I believe the trackingOnly validation sequences should fulfill the use-case of `TrajectorySeedValidation_cff.py`, so I removed that too).\n\nIn addition, the LogWarning in `TrackFromSeedProducer` is downgraded to LogInfo, and monitoring of the number of seeds for which the fit fails is added to MTV. Also the dqmFastTimerServiceClient is added to the trackingOnly DQM harvesting to have the FastTimerService histograms.\n\nTested in CMSSW_8_0_X_2015-12-09-1600, no changes expected in standard workflows.\n\n@rovere @VinInn \n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 11, "closed_at": "1450501797", "comments": 12, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1449755152", "deletions": 88, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "e00a6d8d691793b33eac9ed7488783e34b5d75d0", "merged_at": "1450501797", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 12747, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add validation of seeds and built tracks to trackingOnly validation", "updated_at": "1476957057", "user": "makortel"}

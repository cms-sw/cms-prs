I have done this for several packages in egamma and PF before, as it is recommended by the code guidelines and indeed makes the maintenance of plugins easier. In particular, dealing with the includes and the ESGetToken migration.\r\n\r\nNote that in this package, all the plugins are in `src` even if they should in principal be in the non-existent `plugins` directory. However, I preferred to leave the `.cc` sources where they are not to destroy the git history of the files.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCMSSW compiles.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nNo backport intended.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 23, "closed_at": "1606632891", "comments": 20, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1606240606", "deletions": 1492, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "12c34f6e4d0b661d91b4938f37d8a188d96697d6", "merged_at": "1606632891", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 32266, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 20, "state": "closed", "title": "Merge .h files with .cc plugin files in EgammaPhotonProducers", "updated_at": "1606632891", "user": "guitargeek"}

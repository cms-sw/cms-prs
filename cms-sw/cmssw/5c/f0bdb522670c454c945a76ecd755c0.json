The need for raw tcds data was introduced in #37614 and it is used to assess the presence of Stable Beams or not.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the correct `rawDataInputTag` for the `beamhlt` DQM client and should be deployed in online DQM together with the new menu changes discussed in [JIRA CMSHLT-2325](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSHLT-2325) (more details are also available in the JIRA).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nThe 12_3_X backport (#38103) has already been deployed in production and the results are as expected, see comment in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/38103#issuecomment-1140193579\r\n\r\n#### Backport:\r\nNot a backport.\r\nBackport to 12_3_X: #38103\r\nBackport to 12_4_X: #38111\r\n\r\nFYI @dzuolo @gennai ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1654145066", "comments": 25, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1653717074", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "db-approved", "bug-fix", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "82cdcb2b6b9bb467d4df4895d0eef6c5a6c3143d", "merged_at": "1654145066", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 38110, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "update BeamSpot HLT client to use correct raw data from TCDS", "updated_at": "1654145066", "user": "francescobrivio"}

Needs to be included in 73X in sync with \"Method 2\"  \nhttps://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/5954\n\n(1)\nCurrent TimeSlew modelling has been developed/implemented quite some time ago and it relies on the \"standalone\" signal properties, evaluating the time delay of the signal based on the total charge collected in 4TS.  It was OK for low-PU sparse BX simulation , but becomes less adequate for high-PU 25ns regime.  \n(2)\nThis update still uses existing \"TimeSlew vs full-signal\" parametrization, but it makes estimates for \"full signal\" for each 1TS  and delays each TS accordingly, which corresponds better to the hardware operation mode.\nStill keeps previous TimeSlew smearing evaluated in 2010 (to mimic real data timing variation).  \n(3)  \nMore advanced and detailed simulation of the HCAL FE electronics properties is being developed, but out of scope of 730. \n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_3_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1414673284", "comments": 10, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1414653766", "deletions": 14, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "fully-signed", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "159ab0c25e0adbfc5891ab24cc5e2cca0d014664", "merged_at": "1414673284", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_3_X", "number": 6103, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "TimeSlew modelling update", "updated_at": "1426746552", "user": "abdoulline"}

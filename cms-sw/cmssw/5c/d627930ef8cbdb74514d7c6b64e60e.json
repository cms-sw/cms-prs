Marking functions deprecated seems to be more reliable to generate warnings, so this PR marks the constructors of the legacy EDModule base classes as `CMS_DEPRECATED`.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nA legacy EDAnalyzer https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/12_4_0_pre2/OnlineDB/SiStripO2O/plugins/SiStripPayloadMapTableCreator.cc that doesn't generate a warning in 12_4_0_pre2, generates a warning with this PR.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 10, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1650061309", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["core-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 37592, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Mark legacy EDModule constructors deprecated", "updated_at": "1651097886", "user": "makortel"}

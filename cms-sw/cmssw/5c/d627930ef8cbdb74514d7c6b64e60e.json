Marking functions deprecated seems to be more reliable to generate warnings, so this PR marks the constructors of the legacy EDModule base classes as `CMS_DEPRECATED`.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nA legacy EDAnalyzer https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/12_4_0_pre2/OnlineDB/SiStripO2O/plugins/SiStripPayloadMapTableCreator.cc that doesn't generate a warning in 12_4_0_pre2, generates a warning with this PR.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1651236896", "comments": 20, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1650061309", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "12b3153ff3687d2066993e4bed629c0ede1e34b8", "merged_at": "1651236896", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 37592, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Mark legacy EDModule constructors deprecated", "updated_at": "1651236896", "user": "makortel"}

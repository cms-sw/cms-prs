I have no idea why, but I'll see if this works.  I just merged in #2990 and then rebased onto CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC.  It was CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC that I merged into so I don't think the rebase actually did anything.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "changed_files": 39, "closed_at": "1395740597", "comments": 2, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1395740141", "deletions": 698, "labels": ["geometry-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "107b4de1100221af7867f5f7ab7fc7380c40448a", "merged_at": "1395740597", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "number": 3008, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "Rebase of pull request #2990", "updated_at": "1396865572", "user": "mark-grimes"}

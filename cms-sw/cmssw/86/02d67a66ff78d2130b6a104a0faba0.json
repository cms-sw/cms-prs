When job completes successfully or with another error, that temporary element is not written. The new error was added to edm::errors.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles, framework unit tests pass.\r\nNOTE: some of the unit test results had to be changed from the original PR. Reason unknown.\r\n\r\nBackport of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/41124.

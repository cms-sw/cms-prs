It can just be prepended to any command, e.g.:\r\n```bash\r\nedmTraceException cmsRun ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `gdb` commands used come from @makortel in the Core Software Mattermost. (I just reorganized the commands to `cat` directly into `gdb`, avoiding the creation of a temporary file.)\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRan above command with a `cmsRun` config that was set up to produce an exception, and saw the stack trace printed as expected.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1662465723", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1662128583", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["core-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_6_X", "number": 39293, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "add script to print stack trace for exceptions through gdb", "updated_at": "1662465723", "user": "kpedro88"}

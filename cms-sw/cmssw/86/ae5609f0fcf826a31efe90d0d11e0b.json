It has been tested running with the short matrix (not all tests have finished yet, but there is no issue in sight so far). No differences at all are expected in the jenkins outputs\r\n\r\n[1] https://cmssdt.cern.ch/lxr/source/RecoEgamma/ElectronIdentification/plugins/ElectronIdMVABased.cc#0156", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1529498066", "comments": 27, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1529408881", "deletions": 35, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "6efc87268a1e55dcae873dee0d5a27815972e425", "merged_at": "1529498066", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 23623, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Ignore EDFilters in the reconstruction_step path", "updated_at": "1529498066", "user": "perrotta"}

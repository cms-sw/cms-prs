MC Cosmics-config and collisions [*] tests (including debugging printout inspection of ~100 ev) show expected behaviour: M0 timing vs energy is narrow and stable above several GeV.     \r\n\r\n--------\r\n[*]\r\nNB: green is for new M0 timing, red for current default MAHI one.\r\nThe latter is a pending issue  https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/25526  and now is being revised.\r\n\r\nHB : \r\nhttps://cms-cpt-software.web.cern.ch/cms-cpt-software/General/Validation/SVSuite/HCAL/calo_scan_single_pi/10_X/10_5_0_pre2_2018_newM0timing_vs_10_5_0_pre2_2018_SinglePi/RecHitsTask_timing_vs_energy_profile_HB.gif\r\n\r\nHE : \r\nhttps://cms-cpt-software.web.cern.ch/cms-cpt-software/General/Validation/SVSuite/HCAL/calo_scan_single_pi/10_X/10_5_0_pre2_2018_newM0timing_vs_10_5_0_pre2_2018_SinglePi/RecHitsTask_timing_vs_energy_profile_HE.gif", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1551684839", "deletions": 18, "labels": ["code-checks-pending", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 26054, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "HCAL M0 timing update/cleanup", "updated_at": "1551685196", "user": "abdoulline"}

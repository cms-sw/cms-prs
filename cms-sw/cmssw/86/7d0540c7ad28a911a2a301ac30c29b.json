This means there is a new dependency to RecoTracker.\n\nWhile the changes do fix the crash caused by the geometry dependence of this code, they do not fix the actual problem. The change to the ladder counts is more cosmetic to be consistent with the analogous blade counts; it should remove a number of false 0 entries from the result, but the result is not very meaningful for the upgraded detector anyways.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1460371441", "comments": 8, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1460037937", "deletions": 22, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "e1e7bbd89f9fa54b1a34b6bf9690438c2e59a2cc", "merged_at": "1460371441", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 13986, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "SiPixelDigiValid::analyse: blade number fix", "updated_at": "1460371441", "user": "schneiml"}

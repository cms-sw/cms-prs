This is the complete set of changes that currently allow me to bitwise reproduce the results of l1t-tsg-v3 under 801.  It includes a revert of the HF TP scale change and a local copy of an HF TP conditions from pre6 into 801.  Obviously we don't want either of these, but I wanted to start from something bitwise equivalent, so that we are certain any changes in final version of PR are due to TP updates only.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 196, "closed_at": "1457703710", "comments": 5, "commits": 148, "created_at": "1457431946", "deletions": 1650, "labels": ["alca-pending", "comparison-pending", "db-pending", "l1-pending", "new-package-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 13640, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Foward-port L1T algorithms (l1t-tsg-v3) to 81X.", "updated_at": "1460537923", "user": "mulhearn"}

In practice it seemed to always return a histogram filled between -2.5 and 2.5. However, this misbehaved when filling the new histograms, where a cut on the b-jet discriminator is applied: the \"automatic\" binning range would be more or less random, resulting in flawed comparisons during the software validation.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1501740481", "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1500894690", "deletions": 65, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "ac18042a00c917a86d67e998a7ffc4e9e15e2f0e", "merged_at": "1501740481", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_3_X", "number": 19878, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "B-tag validation/offline DQM: fix efficiency plots on data & eta ranges", "updated_at": "1501740481", "user": "swertz"}

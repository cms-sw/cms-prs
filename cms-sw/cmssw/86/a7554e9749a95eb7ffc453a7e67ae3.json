The old \"2017AllNew\" workflow is made as the new \"2017\" workflow. It is possible that I missed something, but at least everything in this PR needs to be done.\n\nIn addition, a \"2017 design\" workflow is added for further detailed (tracking) studies with the new geometry (also after 810pre13).\n\nTested in 8_1_0_pre12 (rebased on top of ~~CMSSW_8_1_X_2016-09-28-2300~~ ~~CMSSW_8_1_X_2016-10-02-2300~~ ~~CMSSW_8_1_X_2016-10-06-1100~~ ~~CMSSW_8_1_X_2016-10-12-1100~~ CMSSW_8_1_X_2016-10-16-1100), no changes expected between IB 108XX.0, and IB+PR 100XX.0 (or phase0/phase2). Between IB 100XX.0 and IB+PR 100XX.0 changes can be expected everywhere depending on tracker or HCAL (details being a topic of the validation of pre12).\n\n@schneiml @veszpv @kpedro88 \n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 19, "closed_at": "1476799739", "comments": 121, "commits": 9, "created_at": "1474962086", "deletions": 80, "labels": ["alca-approved", "comparison-available", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-approved", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "a95432db236e8c7e26786a6be75e86242f634123", "merged_at": "1476799739", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 15994, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 19, "state": "closed", "title": "Clean up temporary 2017 workflows and eras, add \"2017 design\" workflow", "updated_at": "1478208212", "user": "makortel"}

The update follows what defined in\r\n- https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/SimCalorimetry/HGCalSimProducers/python/hgcalDigitizer_cfi.py\r\n- https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/RecoLocalTracker/SiPhase2Clusterizer/python/phase2TrackerClusterizer_cfi.py\r\n\r\nTo complete on PR test, and example of benefit from the new workflow, this PR also introduces \r\n- a new workfow `.76` which the `DIGI` and `HLT:@relval2026` steps are running together instead of `HLT:@fake`.  The new workflow will allow us to develop Phase2 HLT DQM and sequence to be used in future Phase-2 production. This PR is an effort to help on validation as mentioned in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/39362.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nRun test with the following workflows: \r\n- `20834.75`: To make sure that Phase-2 HLT is still running properly.\r\n- `20834.76`: To show that `DIGI` and `HLT:@relval2026` can run together.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\nNone.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 4, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1665743554", "deletions": 17, "labels": ["hlt-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "tests-started", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_6_X", "number": 39733, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Update Phase-2 Tracker and HGCAL HLT config files", "updated_at": "1665744004", "user": "srimanob"}

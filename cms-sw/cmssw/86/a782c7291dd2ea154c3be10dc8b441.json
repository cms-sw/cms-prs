The ROIs are formed from tracks found by existing iterations, and they are tagged with an MVA that helps to reduce the CPU time. The tagged ROIs are used as tracking regions for the new iteration.\r\n\r\nSince the previous PR, I have updated RecoTracker/IterativeTracking/python/DisplacedRegionalStep_cff.py with changes made to TobTecStep_cff.py, which it was originally based on. There are further studies/optimizations to explore, but the iteration, as a process modifier, should be ready for integration now.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI re-ran the tracking, both without and with the new iteration, on a sample of HSSbbbb signal events that we used previously, where S is a long-lived scalar with a mass of 40 GeV and lifetime of 500 mm/c. The below plots are the resulting efficiencies vs. dxy. On the left is what was obtained previously, when #32806 was submitted, and the right plot is what we get now. Although the shapes of the efficiencies have changed significantly, the effect of the new iteration is qualitatively the same and even greater in magnitude, showing that it still behaves as expected.\r\n\r\n![eff_vs_dxy](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5114977/215625182-5594ea88-8d8a-47af-845b-1914c9295005.png)\r\n\r\nEDIT: I measured the event sizes by running the 11834.0 workflow (TTbar_14TeV+2021PU) with 100 events, both with and without the DisplacedRegionalStep enabled. The results are in the following table:\r\n\r\n| | RECO | MINIAOD | NANOAOD |\r\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |\r\n| without DisplacedRegionalStep | 4311.2 kB/event | 147.0 kB/event | 61.5 kB/event |\r\n| with DisplacedRegionalStep | 4320.0 kB/event | 147.3 kB/event | 61.6 kB/event |\r\n| relative change | 0.20% | 0.17% | 0.26% |\r\n\r\nFrom the DQM step of the same workflow, which was run on our local T3, I got the following mean CPU times:\r\n- total RECO time: 46 s/event\r\n- DisplacedRegionalStep time: 0.57 s/event (1.2% of RECO)", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 31, "comments": 50, "commits": 20, "created_at": "1675120701", "deletions": 35, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "dqm-pending", "operations-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-rejected", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "upgrade-pending", "requires-external", "code-checks-approved", "tracking"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_1_X", "number": 40643, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 41, "state": "open", "title": "Displaced regional tracking iteration", "updated_at": "1676600496", "user": "aehart"}

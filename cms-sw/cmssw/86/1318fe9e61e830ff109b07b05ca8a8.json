This is done by modifying `NPUTablesProducer.cc`  to find the maximum value in the `vector<float>` returned by `getPU_pT_hats()` and then store in the PileUp table. \r\n\r\nA flag is also added and set to **false** in `globals_cff.py` so that this variable will not be stored in the main NanoAODs. The flag is set to true in `custom_jme_cff.py` so that it will be stored in the JME custom NanoAOD format.  \r\n\r\nThe variable is needed by JERC analyses, which will use the JME Custom NanoAODs.\r\n\r\n**if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:**\r\n\r\nThis PR needs to be backported to 10_6_X, once merged, for the ultra legacy campaigns.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1603173078", "comments": 21, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1602864993", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved", "xpog-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "32270f743c25653069ad7f6a6e5cf6525b353a45", "merged_at": "1603173078", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 31831, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add maximum of pileup pT hats in JME custom NanoAOD", "updated_at": "1603806985", "user": "nurfikri89"}

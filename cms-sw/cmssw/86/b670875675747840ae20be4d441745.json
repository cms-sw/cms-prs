In addition, the pile-up distribution of of the events can be constructed.\nThe results are stored as lumi-products and can be used at analysis level to compute event weights for MC samples.\nThese integrations are performed routinely on MC samples in order to properly weight events according to the cross section and pile-up distribution. Having a central tool to achieve the goal should be useful for many people in the collaboration.\n\nNote: I am making this pull request for 7_4_X, even though it would be useful to also back-port this to 7_2.  I hope I am following the right procedure.\n\nAutomatically ported from CMSSW_7_4_X #7042\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 8, "closed_at": "1425362905", "comments": 4, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1424174211", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-pending", "core-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-rejected", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 7809, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Added WeightsCountProducer to common utilities", "updated_at": "1425362905", "user": "cmsbuild"}

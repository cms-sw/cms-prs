As the HLT phase2 timing test is run on a \"Milan\" node equipped with NVIDIA T4s, this on one hand has improved the general timing of the menu, but on the other hand it doesn't give back a realistic picture of the time needed to run when no GPU backed is available, for example when running MC productions.\r\nAt the same time, it is now possible to be more aggressive with the reconstruction used in the NGT menu to avoid running full tracking on all events accepted by the L1T, but profiting of the phase 2 CA extension implemented in #48921 use the pixel track collection as \"general\" track collection for the rest of the HLT reconstruction (analogously to what done in `runTheMatrix.py` for workflow family `XXXXX.774`).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nNone, will be tested in the PR itself\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

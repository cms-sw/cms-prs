It adds all the pieces needed to parse and compare the new CICADA condition added in uTM v 0.12.0. This is being opened in draft because no unpacker/packer combo is available yet, but will be added after I have had the chance to speak to experts about reading the CICADA record.\r\n\r\nDepends on utm version 0.12.0\r\n\r\n@elfontan You should likely take a look at my work on this, this is more working with uGT than I am used to.\r\n\r\n@cms-sw/hlt-l2 Just in case you aren't automatically pinged on this, FYI. There is no unpacker/packer, but I will keep this in draft while I develop them. I will be speak to experts about it ASAP.\r\n\r\nEDIT 06/03/24: Draft unpacker (not non-trivially tested) added.\r\n\r\n### PR validation:\r\n\r\nAll code compiles and has had code formatting applied.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I have tested the emulator on a new proto-type menu including a CICADA seed:\r\nhttps://cernbox.cern.ch/files/link/public/LeBbgndwFDjWoI5?tiles-size=1&items-per-page=100&view-mode=resource-table\r\n\r\nThe emulator runs all the way through. The following are debug statements (now removed) from various components of the global board, CICADA conditions, and trigger menu parser showing that the emulator receives the score, compares to the menu, and in this case, decides it is below threshold and doesn't pass the menu cut:\r\n\r\n```\r\nBegin processing the 2nd record.

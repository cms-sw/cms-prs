It combines `G4Transportation` and multiple scattering, which allows to move directly from one discrete interaction point to the next, with all intermediate steps due to MSC combined into one `G4Step`.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe default is not changed in this PR, simulation results should be identical. Adding `process.g4SimHits.G4Commands = ['/process/em/transportationWithMsc MultipleSteps']` enables the new process with small performance improvements, results to be validated.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1659223060", "comments": 13, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1658997246", "deletions": 26, "labels": ["simulation-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "0dd62d13441f7f3b62b94c62c30fd2baaaba0826", "merged_at": "1659223060", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 38879, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Introduce option to use G4TransportationWithMsc", "updated_at": "1659223060", "user": "hahnjo"}

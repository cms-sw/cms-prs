This is needed in the case of ensemble models, such as the pytorch-based ECAL DRN.  This update pulls the component models of the overall ensemble model locally in order to edit them.  Previously, the ensemble model was pulled locally, but the component models were not, so the server could not start.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nLocal tests performed to validated that files are pulled and edited as expected, that fallback servers can start, and that a workflow with the ECAL DRN can run to completion\r\n\r\nTagging @kpedro88 ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 14, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1686077393", "deletions": 10, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "tests-rejected", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "heterogeneous-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_2_X", "number": 41885, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 15, "state": "open", "title": "Automated thread control with ensemble models", "updated_at": "1686155007", "user": "wpmccormack"}

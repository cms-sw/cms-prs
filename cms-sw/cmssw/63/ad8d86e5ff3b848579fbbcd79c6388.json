Consequently, eta and phi of such candidates are reset to 0 which can lead to spurious association of these candidates to jets whose axes point in the vicinity of (eta,phi)=(0,0). To reject such spurious associations, the candidate momentum is required to be greater than 0.\r\n\r\nThis change is completely transparent to all existing b-tagging algorithms and all monitored quantities. It manifests itself only in non-default setups where Puppi candidates are set as input for b tagging.\nAutomatically ported from CMSSW_9_0_X #17626 (original by @cms-btv-pog).\nPlease wait for a new IB (12 to 24H) before requesting to test this PR.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1488727281", "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1488454281", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "4bf64140bac01da27afd651efb17bea46ee0bcce", "merged_at": "1488727281", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_1_X", "number": 17710, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Reject 0 pt Puppi candidates in jet-track association", "updated_at": "1489567890", "user": "cmsbuild"}

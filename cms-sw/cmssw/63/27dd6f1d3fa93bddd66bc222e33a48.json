Two new filters were added to BeamHaloSummary but are not used anywhere so far. So all the changes, except the two mentioned above should not break anything and the size of the updated classes should not be dramatically modified.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 11, "closed_at": "1442551294", "comments": 20, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1442347305", "deletions": 52, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "a96ef7a53eb4814de8b6fc523f7a9ac85bc521e5", "merged_at": "1442551294", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 11266, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "CSC Beam Halo filter update", "updated_at": "1442575588", "user": "lathomas"}

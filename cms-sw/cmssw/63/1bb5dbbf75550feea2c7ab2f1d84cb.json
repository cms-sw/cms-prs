This generates a data file containing Run 2 Scouting objects with known content. Then it reads it. It verifies that when we read it we obtain values that match the known written values for all the data fields in the objects. In particular all containers have content so all contained types are also read.\r\n\r\nIt also reads the old files in the DataFormats-Scouting data repository which are listed in the shell script. The plan is that each time a Run 2 Scouting data format is modified an additional file will be added. The data files required for this PR were generated with releases 8_0_7 (2016 data), 9_4_0 (2017 data), and 10_2_0 (2018 data). Note that to create those files those older releases were patched with extra test code which is in the first 3 commits in this PR.\r\n\r\nThere are 10 events with content and vector sizes varying from event to event.\r\n\r\nThis PR depends on the external DataFormats-Scouting, cms-data/DataFormats-Scouting#2. See issue #41040 for more information.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis only adds a unit test in DataFormats/Scouting which passes. It shouldn't affect anything else.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 11, "comments": 11, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1686317042", "deletions": 184, "labels": ["core-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "requires-external", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_2_X", "number": 41913, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Add unit test for Run 2 Scouting data formats", "updated_at": "1686327551", "user": "wddgit"}

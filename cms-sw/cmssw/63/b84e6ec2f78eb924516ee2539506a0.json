With this PR, we'll just start making use of 16 bits and still have another 16 available.\r\nIt would be really nice if we can target NanoAODv13.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1699626881", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved", "xpog-pending", "egamma"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "number": 43247, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Add CaloIdL_MW seeded filter and split the legs of CaloIdL_TrackIdL_IsoVL filter on nanoAOD filterBits", "updated_at": "1700044995", "user": "iasonkrom"}

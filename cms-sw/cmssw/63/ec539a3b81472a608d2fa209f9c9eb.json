So this implementation cannot be used with all the clustering algorithms for the moment. This implementation is therefore not used as default.\r\n* Usage of DetIds is now generic in all the algos and the management of different types of DetIds has been moved to `HGCalTriggerTools`\r\n* Minor update of the multicluster class, adding H/E in the data members\r\n\r\nDepends on external cms-data/L1Trigger-L1THGCal#11", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 48, "comments": 1, "commits": 30, "created_at": "1550220750", "deletions": 221, "labels": ["code-checks-pending", "comparison-pending", "l1-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "upgrade-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_5_X", "number": 25949, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[HGCAL trigger] New implementation for the V9 geometry", "updated_at": "1550220783", "user": "jbsauvan"}

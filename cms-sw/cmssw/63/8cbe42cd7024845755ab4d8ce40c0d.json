Without them we can easily apply the tagger also on miniAOD, and therefore we switched them off at the moment. Though the possibility to switch them back on later is kept, because there is a possibiltiy they give better data/MC agreement.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_3_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1416541289", "comments": 14, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1416330995", "deletions": 63, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "689a95d650574fa40c7d51be0b9dcd5aa4172fdb", "merged_at": "1416541289", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_3_X", "number": 6482, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 5, "state": "closed", "title": "Qg tagger update nov2014", "updated_at": "1416541289", "user": "UAEDF-tomc"}

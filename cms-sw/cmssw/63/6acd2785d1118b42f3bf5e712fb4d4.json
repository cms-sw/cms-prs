It consists of a single update to the Run 3 prompt GT. The reason for the backport is essentially technical: since new labeled records were introduced to the PR in master, the Run 3 prompt GT in autoCond needed to be updated as well. But I don't want to needlessly branch the prompt GT queues ahead of the release series that is used online. So I updated the 11_1_X GTs and therefore the updates need to be backported to 11_1_X and 11_2_X.\r\n\r\nThe GT diff is as follows:\r\n\r\n**Run 3 data (prompt)**\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/111X_dataRun3_Prompt_v4/111X_dataRun3_Prompt_v5\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n`runTheMatrix.py -l limited,138.1 --ibeos`\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nThis PR is a backport of PR #32435.

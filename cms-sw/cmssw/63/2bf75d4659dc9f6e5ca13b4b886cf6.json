This time I noticed that the option `preFilteredSeeds` is `false` and it apparently has been for the long time. In this situation, the producer does not use the `SeedFilter` class from the EgammaElectronAlgos library. I therefore suggest to remove the usage of this class and the class itself, so the `ElectronSeedProducer` can live with much less configuration parameters. Like this the plugin is easier to understand and I also hope that this way, it gets easier apparent in the future how this plugin can potentially be unified or replaced with the `ElectronNHitSeedProducer` which is used at the HLT.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I merged the `.h` and `.cc` files of some other producers in the electron reconstruction chain.\r\n\r\nThis PR does not collide with my two PRs from earlier today (https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/29303, https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/29295):\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCMSSW compiles, matrix tests pass.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nNo backport intended.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 18, "closed_at": "1587147626", "comments": 31, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1585160600", "deletions": 961, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "pdmv-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "b97bd8588a2c06559e9bdbf5d294d4e4e614f3cc", "merged_at": "1587147626", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 29304, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 7, "state": "closed", "title": "Remove unused SeedFilter class in EgammaElectronAlgos to simplify ElectronSeedProducer", "updated_at": "1587147626", "user": "guitargeek"}

However, right before they are read out, the BX0 is shifted by -5 BX to BX0=3 so that they agree with the firmware. \r\n* CLCTs constructed with the CLCT processor will have BX0=7. However, when they are used in the\r\nCSCMotherboard to be correlated to ALCTs, they are shifted by +1 BX to BX0=8. That ensures that ALCT and CLCT timing follow the same definition in the correlation algorithm.\r\n* LCTs constructed with the CSCMotherboard will have BX0=8. This new convention has been communicated with MTF experts. A global constant in CSCConstants `LCT_CENTRAL_BX` and `CSCInputBXShift` in the EMTF configuration ensure that the track-finders are modified accordingly.\r\n* With these changes, the CSC local trigger will no longer need a special option to re-emulate from real data.\r\n\r\nValidation plots can be found here:\r\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/707700/contributions/2905136/attachments/1604505/2545291/CSCEmulation20180221.pdf\r\n\r\nFYI @tahuang1991 @ptcox @abrinke1 ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 14, "comments": 41, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1519236119", "deletions": 33, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-pending", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 22288, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Shift the CSC LCT central BX from 6 to 8 in simulation", "updated_at": "1523886874", "user": "dildick"}

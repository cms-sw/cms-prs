The framework needs to know how many streams are still processing a Lumi. Before, it checked the status of each item in the container. However, looking at that entry was not guaranteed to be synchronized across all threads. Adding streamLumiActive_ atomic variable allows the check to be done just by reading the atomic plus the atomic functions as a way to guarantee that the entry information can safely be read across threads. This is done by having streamLumiActive_ be written right after streamLumiStatus_ entry was changed and then read from streamLumiActive_ before reading the entry from streamLumiStatus_.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1521618541", "comments": 26, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1521145474", "deletions": 10, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "29c4b1db64e8662963cc93a7679fb0e12e734710", "merged_at": "1521618541", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_1_X", "number": 22637, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Provide guard for streamLumiStatus_", "updated_at": "1521618541", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

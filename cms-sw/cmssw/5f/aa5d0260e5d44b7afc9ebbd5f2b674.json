The function TypeWithDict::pointerToBase() compared two types for equality by comparing the TypeWithDict pointers.  This is a bug, because there can easily be more than one TypeWithDict object for the same type.\nThe fix is to compare the std::type_info (instead of TypeWithDict) for each of the two types, first by comparing the pointers, and, if the pointers are unequal, comparing the std::type_info's by value.\nThis fixes one framework unit test that was failing in the ROOT6 branch.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_ROOT6_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1389210157", "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1389209794", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["core-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "441139ee0f021ea50e12c65f3dd9b4d8e7908a0e", "merged_at": "1389210157", "merged_by": "davidlt", "number": 1967, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix check for same type", "updated_at": "1389211020", "user": "wmtan"}

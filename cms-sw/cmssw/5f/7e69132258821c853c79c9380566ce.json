The old threshold has been at 1 GeV, which is too low and the plots are dominated by detector noise seen in previous cosmic runs. The new threshold is set at 4 GeV, which should be well above the average noise levels reported by ECAL. Filling conditions are also added to be consistent with normal events filling, i.e. do not fill if there is problematic tower masked etc.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe codes are tested by running offline DQM on recent runs with unstable beams collisions, which has more high energy TPs to see the real effects. The DQM plots are properly filled and the ECAL experts are satisfied with this modification.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with any link to  -->\r\n\r\nPR to master: https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/38361\r\nThis backport is for integrating into online DQM production, currently based on CMSSW_12_3_5_patch1.\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1655405278", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 38399, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[backport] Change at CaloLayer1 DQM the filling threshold for ECAL 5BX plots", "updated_at": "1655527709", "user": "hftsoi"}

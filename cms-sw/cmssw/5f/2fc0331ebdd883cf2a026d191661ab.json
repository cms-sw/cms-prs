Said module contains offline and online dqm plots which are switched using configuration parameter. \r\nExisting pixel dqm was serving as a reference for online/offline switch: \r\nhttps://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/DQM/CTPPS/plugins/CTPPSPixelDQMSource.cc\r\n\r\nCommented plots in DQM module might be re-activated in the future and therefore were not deleted.\r\n\r\n**Testing**\r\nDue to lack of data (see #34759) automatic testing of this code is not possible. Manual test  is available at **RecoPPS/test** directory.\r\n\r\n**Memory performance**\r\nThis is memory consumption for cmsRun process running the DQM module.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52073715/135085769-6dd66019-4c2a-4130-a585-58c8ae4d0450.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "comments": 35, "commits": 11, "created_at": "1632824959", "deletions": 11, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "dqm-pending", "operations-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "number": 35445, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Diamond sampic dqm", "updated_at": "1633450403", "user": "ChrisMisan"}

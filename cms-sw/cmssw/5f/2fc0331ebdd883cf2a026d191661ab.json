Said module contains offline and online dqm plots which are switched using configuration parameter. \r\nExisting pixel dqm was serving as a reference for online/offline switch: \r\nhttps://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/DQM/CTPPS/plugins/CTPPSPixelDQMSource.cc\r\n\r\nCommented plots in DQM module might be re-activated in the future and therefore were not deleted.\r\n\r\n**Testing**\r\nDue to lack of data (see #34759) automatic testing of this code is not possible. Manual test  is available at **RecoPPS/test** directory.\r\n\r\n**Memory performance**\r\nThis is memory consumption for cmsRun process running the DQM module.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52073715/135085769-6dd66019-4c2a-4130-a585-58c8ae4d0450.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": "1634195739", "comments": 75, "commits": 15, "created_at": "1632824959", "deletions": 10, "labels": ["dqm-approved", "operations-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "bee9d31dc248c6cac85c0d1b30ace95c85dfe703", "merged_at": "1634195738", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "number": 35445, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "Diamond sampic dqm", "updated_at": "1634195739", "user": "ChrisMisan"}

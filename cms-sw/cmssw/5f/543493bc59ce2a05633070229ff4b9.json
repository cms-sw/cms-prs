The former is based on `reco::Track` to reuse the existing functionality.\r\n  * Conditions formats: `LHCOpticalFunctionsCollection` with functions that describe proton propagation from the interaction point to the Roman Pots. `CTPPSBeamParameters` with relevant beam parameters, possibly calibrated with Roman Pot data.\r\n  * Reconstruction module: `RecoCTPPS/ProtonReconstruction`.\r\n  * Configuration update: proton reconstruction has been appended to the standard PPS reconstruction sequence: https://github.com/CTPPS/cmssw/blob/proton_reco_10_4_X/RecoCTPPS/Configuration/python/recoCTPPS_sequences_cff.py#L29\r\n  * Validation suite: `Validation/CTPPS` to validate all elements in the reconstruction/simulation chain.\r\n  * Test based on 2016 data: `Validation/CTPPS/test/year_2016`. Most files in this directory related to conditions data will be replaced by database in near future - several activities in this direction are already in progress, hopefully targeting 10_4_pre6.

Since the harvesting semantic changes from #26232 this plot was showing incorrect values, depending on the order that LS where processed in.\r\n\r\nThe fix is a simple additional `Reset` call to restore the old semantics. However, there are more problems with this module: The `Physics Declared` row seems to not work correctly since a long time, and shows more arbitrary fluctuations with this change. Also, it is not clear if this code will work without the SCAL FED.\r\n\r\nTherefore, in the longer term, we should drop this module and replace it with the logically much simpler online version. That, however, might require additional changes to the render plugins in DQMGUI.\r\n\r\nThis PR also contains some scripts to help debugging such problems in HARVESTING.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nIn the `runTheMatrix` workflows no changes are expected, since the problem only appears when more than one lumisecition is processed. This PR contains a test script that re-runs harvesting from production DQMIO data that was used to test this change.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\n\r\nNot a backport, but we might want a backport for UL rereco.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1568917550", "comments": 12, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1568637593", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "227ea1f7d670647a37d063d2d9e4ebf7c1d1a3a4", "merged_at": "1568917550", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 28002, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "DQM/Info: fix offline DCS bit summary", "updated_at": "1568917551", "user": "schneiml"}

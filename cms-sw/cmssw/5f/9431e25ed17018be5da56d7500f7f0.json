It should not affect any offline processing. Main changes include:\r\n\r\n   * TriggerKey is now generated together with LUTs (as opposed to by a separate online tool)\r\n   * adding typinfo element to both LUT and TriggerKey content to support new online xmldb format. \r\n   * add input information for LUT generation to TriggerKey content which will be used by O2O for automatic synchronization of online LUTs and corresponding offline conditions updates\r\n   * plus some minor fixes and improvements (input parameters are defined in input card, fix/update  for crate to subdet id function etc. )\r\n\r\n \r\n#### PR validation:\r\nThe code has been used to generate past and upcoming online LUTs and trigger keys. \r\nThe PR should not affect any offline workflow. \r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1582036356", "comments": 23, "commits": 9, "created_at": "1581501550", "deletions": 85, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "db-approved", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "e94878a3b6ae2ece0a357abb9f3402d30099aaa8", "merged_at": "1582036356", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 28930, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 8, "state": "closed", "title": "Updates for HCAL online TPG LUT and Trigger keys", "updated_at": "1582036357", "user": "ak427"}

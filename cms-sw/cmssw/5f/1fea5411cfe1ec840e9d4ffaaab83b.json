Based on the plot at [1], we determined that it would be best if we slightly raised the threshold on the number of pixels.\r\n\r\n[1] https://indico.cern.ch/event/754818/contributions/3127986/attachments/1709774/2757318/clusterCheck.pdf\r\n\r\n@mandrenguyen ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1536345433", "comments": 18, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1536073550", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "c49097246abb83a35d9e4d6dac1309aa7c59c663", "merged_at": "1536345433", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_3_X", "number": 24466, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Raised nPix threshhold on pp_on_AA_2018 era track cluster checker", "updated_at": "1536345433", "user": "abaty"}

Now all parameters are moved from a PSet to xml files, as done for other detectors, and the MTDParametersFromDD class has been adapted accordingly.\r\n\r\nFurthermore it addresses comments by @makortel to #25384 concerning the previous implementation of MTDTopologyMode, which was simply cloned from HCAL code. Now there is an enum Class and a function moving strings into values of this enum, both defined in a namespace MTDTopologyMode. The MTDTopologyAnalyzer class has been extended in order to dump both the original DetId built from DD (and in the MTDCommonData tests) and the information are reconstructed from the generic DetId by the MTD Topology. @lgray this class produces the output I ask you to cross check for consistency.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 20, "comments": 23, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1543933372", "deletions": 115, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "geometry-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "upgrade-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_4_X", "number": 25417, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 5, "state": "open", "title": "MTD geometry: move topology parameters from PSet to xml, adapt the code", "updated_at": "1544083189", "user": "fabiocos"}

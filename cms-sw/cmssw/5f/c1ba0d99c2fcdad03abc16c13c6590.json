The need for raw tcds data was introduced in #37614 and it is used to assess the presence of Stable Beams or not.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the correct `rawDataInputTag` for the `beamhlt` DQM client and should be deployed in online DQM together with the new menu changes discussed in [JIRA CMSHLT-2325](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSHLT-2325) (more details are also available in the JIRA).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nCode compiles.\r\nWe can't do much more testing at the moment because we need a streamer file with the updated menu.\r\n\r\n#### Backport:\r\nNot a backport but forwardports to 12_4_X and 12_5_X will be opened soon.\r\nImprovements to the unitTest will be added in a subsequent PR.\r\n\r\nFYI @mmusich @dzuolo @gennai @missirol @Sam-Harper @boudoul ", "branch": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 20, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1653662666", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "db-approved", "bug-fix", "backport"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 38103, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[12_3_X] update BeamSpot HLT client to use correct raw data from TCDS", "updated_at": "1654143563", "user": "francescobrivio"}

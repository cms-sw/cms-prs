(See my presentation at the July 11 Simulation meeting, https://indico.cern.ch/event/329213/.)  The change for the pixels is a little deeper than for the strips, since until now the pixel simLinks never supported simHit pointers, CFposition().  The size of a simlink thus grows from 16 to 20 byates.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_2_X", "changed_files": 9, "closed_at": "1406101676", "comments": 11, "commits": 11, "created_at": "1405807627", "deletions": 52, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "46bfdde114fd48f5de4340368473efd34f94a019", "merged_at": "1406101676", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_2_X", "number": 4711, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "New pixel sim link", "updated_at": "1406601160", "user": "wmtford"}

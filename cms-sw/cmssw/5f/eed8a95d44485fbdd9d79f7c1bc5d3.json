Plots are made for CLCT bending resolution, and CLCT 1/2-strip, 1/4-strip and 1/8-strip resolution. The latter two only make sense for chambers that have the CCLUT algorithm enabled (MEX/1 in the baseline commissioning model). \r\n\r\nThis PR is part of an investigation into the EMTF performance for 1 TeV muons with Run-3 CSC trigger primitives. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRan 1000 events from ```/RelValSingleMuPt1000/CMSSW_12_0_0_pre4-120X_mcRun3_2021_realistic_v2-v1/GEN-SIM-DIGI-RAW``` with \r\n```\r\ncmsRun Validation/MuonCSCDigis/test/runCSCDigiValidation_cfg.py\r\ncmsRun Validation/MuonCSCDigis/test/runCSCDigiHarvesting_cfg.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlots should automatically appear in ```MuonCSCDigisV/CSCDigiTask/Stub/Resolution/```.

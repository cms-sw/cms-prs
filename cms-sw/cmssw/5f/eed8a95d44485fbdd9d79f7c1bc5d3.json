Plots are made for CLCT bending resolution, and CLCT 1/2-strip, 1/4-strip and 1/8-strip resolution. The latter two only make sense for chambers that have the CCLUT algorithm enabled (MEX/1 in the baseline commissioning model). \r\n\r\nI also added diagnostic plots for ALCT, CLCT, CLCT pre-trigger, and LCT for each chamber type and for each endcap (sometimes we see asymmetries in the performance). I borrowed a lot of code from the L1T CSC DQM tools which I wrote earlier this year. I organized the plots by object, and by type of plot, so it's not all in one directory. The screenshot below shows the directory structure (tested on 100 1TeV muon events). Not every object has each type of plot. E.g. I don't have resolution plots for ALCTs.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"435\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-09-22 at 4 39 39 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4134786/134431746-44eb2194-9833-4452-8b7b-24d3646aa06b.png\">\r\n\r\nThis PR is part of an investigation into the EMTF performance for 1 TeV muons with Run-3 CSC trigger primitives. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRan 1000 events from ```/RelValSingleMuPt1000/CMSSW_12_0_0_pre4-120X_mcRun3_2021_realistic_v2-v1/GEN-SIM-DIGI-RAW``` with \r\n```\r\ncmsRun Validation/MuonCSCDigis/test/runCSCDigiValidation_cfg.py\r\ncmsRun Validation/MuonCSCDigis/test/runCSCDigiHarvesting_cfg.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlots should automatically appear in ```MuonCSCDigisV/CSCDigiTask/Stub/Resolution/```.

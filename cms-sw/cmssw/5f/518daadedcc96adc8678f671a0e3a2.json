Nowadays, we can therefore assume that this feature is always available. That means we don't have to use GLEW to check whether this feature is present.\r\n\r\nLike that, we can avoid using GLEW entirely, which is an implementation detail of OpenGL loading in ROOT that will soon go away.\r\n\r\nTo make sure GLEW is not included anymore, this commit replaces includes of `TGLIncludes.h` with the OpenGL headers only, because `TGLIncludes.h` was including OpenGL plus GLEW.\r\n\r\nSee also:\r\n\r\n  * https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/18471\r\n  * https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/20294#issuecomment-3501449951\r\n  * 1235f792c29b126e2e2d5c9522d53788d0da8961\r\n\r\nFYI @smuzaffar @bellenot @osschar ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 8, "closed_at": "1762851590", "comments": 14, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1762517291", "deletions": 22, "labels": ["visualization-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "9b48379e5e75256f12e022013a5714bc441d803f", "merged_at": "1762851590", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_16_0_X", "number": 49341, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Don't use GLEW in Fireworks", "updated_at": "1762851591", "user": "guitargeek"}

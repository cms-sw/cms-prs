This is a new feature and it is not expected to change the output of any existing workflow.\r\n\r\n- In the near future, we plan to use this feature to create and upload PPS RECO geometry payloads to the offline DB, to be used in Run 2 proton reconstruction workflows. \r\n\r\n- No dependence on other PR's.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe validation was performed by comparing the positions of the geometry elements (PPS pot and sensors) obtained from the DB file with those obtained from the corresponding XML geometry files. Perfect agreement is observed. Text print out files can be made available if needed, although they are some hundred lines long.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nNot a backport.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1613123659", "comments": 10, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1612567219", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "db-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "ffacaad02dd3889787c641a8135a4cbe322baa87", "merged_at": "1613123658", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 32836, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Change/add scripts to write PPS RECO geometry payloads to a DB file", "updated_at": "1613123659", "user": "wpcarvalho"}

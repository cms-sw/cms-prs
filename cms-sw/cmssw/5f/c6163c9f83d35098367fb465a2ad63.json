This was implemented so that the output should not change at all (given that the SubProcess feature was already removed, there already can't be any SubProcesses).\r\n\r\nI couldn't resist adding some minor code cleanup to simplify things a little. Nothing that should affect the behavior.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI'm hoping that FastTimerService experts can take a look and verify nothing changes. I don't see any unit tests that exercise this. I will enable the hlt_p2_timing option to ensure the PR tests run the service.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1748614236", "deletions": 350, "labels": ["hlt-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 48218, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Remove SubProcess related code from FastTimerService", "updated_at": "1748614674", "user": "wddgit"}

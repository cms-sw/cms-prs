This is relevant since the constituent subtraction is particle-by-particle subtraction and therefore produces a new set of PF candidates.\r\n2) added the production of background estimates (HiFJRhoProducer) to the heavy ion reconstruction.\r\n3) added CSJetProducer which is heavily based on the FastJet contrib package but has the possibility to use eta-dependent --corresponding to CMS detector response-- background estimates. In the future we might also add phi-dependence and therefore we prefer to maintain our own version.\r\n4) The Cs jet production is added to the standard heavy ion workflow.\r\n\r\nThis PR doesn't need any specific developments for phase 1.\r\n\r\nThe PR was tested on wf 145\r\n\r\nA report on this method in heavy ion collision at the JMAR meeting can be found here:\r\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/502737/contributions/2012693/attachments/1237496/1817780/160302_ConstituentSubtraction.pdf\r\n\r\n@rappoccio @mandrenguyen @cfmcginn @kurtejung @ahinzmann ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1499161032", "comments": 62, "commits": 13, "created_at": "1495455560", "deletions": 41, "labels": ["comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_9_3_X", "number": 18883, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 20, "state": "closed", "title": "Integration of constituent subtracted jets into heavy ion reconstruction", "updated_at": "1499161033", "user": "mverwe"}

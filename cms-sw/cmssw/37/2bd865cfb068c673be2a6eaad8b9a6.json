If deemed viable, the next steps would be to update `DataFormats/Portable` README and `scripts`, and then update all the other `classes_def.xml` files that declare these portable data products.\r\n\r\nResolves https://github.com/cms-sw/framework-team/issues/1542\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe `testHeterogeneousCoreAlpakaTestWriteReadSerialSync` unit test succeeds with the build of https://github.com/cms-sw/root/pull/222#issuecomment-3235701670. The resulting `rootmap` contains the `::Product`, `::Layout`, and `::Implementation` type aliases that the read rules use.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 4, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1756492880", "deletions": 7, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved", "heterogeneous-pending", "changes-dataformats"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 48824, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[RFC] Improve `PortableHost{Collection,Object}` dictionary declarations", "updated_at": "1756493633", "user": "makortel"}

This is not strictly necessary, since this file is not changed here, but simplifies moving forward.\r\n\r\nThere is a conflict with #21794: The two might not conflict formally, and will also not cause problem if both get merged (for now), but the later of the two should be corrected to not touch the freshly converted `DQMGlobalEDAnalyzer` modules.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 78, "comments": 8, "commits": 11, "created_at": "1518711162", "deletions": 169, "labels": ["alca-pending", "analysis-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-notrun", "dqm-approved", "fastsim-pending", "l1-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-rejected"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_1_X", "number": 22243, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "More config changes for DQMEDAnalyzer", "updated_at": "1518717090", "user": "schneiml"}

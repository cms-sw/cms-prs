For L1Scouting data, each processing event is actually an orbit (in OrbitCollection), different OutputModule is needed to convert orbits to bunch crossings (bx).\r\n\r\nSome key features:\r\n- ```OrbitNanoAODOutputModule``` is analogous to ```NanoAODOutputModule``` and is used to convert orbits to bxs.\r\n- ```OrbitFlatTable``` is analogous to ```nanoaod::FlatTable``` and contains offsets of each bx in an orbit\r\n- ```SimpleOrbitFlatTableProducer``` is analogous to ```SimpleFlatTableProducer``` and has all functionalities of ```SimpleFlatTableProducer```.\r\n\r\nTwo custom NanoAOD flavours are added: ```@L1Scout``` for ZeroBias stream and ```@L1ScoutSelect``` for Selection stream.\r\n\r\nEvent content files (html) can be found [here](https://cernbox.cern.ch/s/nAMNYICmV8nYi8i) on CERNBOX.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nPass all tests from ```scram b runtests use-ibeos```.\r\n\r\nTwo relval_nano workflows are added for each flavour.\r\nPass these two workflows from ```runTheMatrix.py -l 2500.240,2500.241```\r\n\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

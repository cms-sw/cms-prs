See presentation at HLT upgrade [1] from slide 15 with the comparison between TICLv4 and TICLv5.\r\nThis PR introduces a first stage of changes:\r\n- Addressing the Trackster-Trackster linking, limiting links between objects in the HGCAL-CEE region, where the occupancy of the detector can lead the linking to merge too many tracksters, eventually building candidates with lot of contamination from PU that are affecting the final jet reconstruction.\r\n- Moving the energy regression at the TICLCandidateProducer level, where the final calorimeter objects are produced after the additional Trackster-Trackster linking through the Track-Trackster linking.\r\n- Remove Track-only candidates building for tracks that have not been linked to any trackster. This change remove possible candidate duplication in case of failure in the Track-Trackster linking step\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nThe PR has been tested on CMSSW_15_1_0_pre5. Physics validation has been performed exploiting the HLT Jet Validation. \r\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of the changes, a comparison between Baseline and PR has been performed on a QCD sample in 200 PU, where the energy regression was turned off (as the regression is the other issue that will be fixed in a future PR). \r\nBelow some plots where on the **left you have the Baseline** while on the **right the PR changes** have been applied\r\n### pT Response with energy correction\r\n\r\nDistributions after the changes look more healthy\r\n\r\n<img width=\"300\" height=\"300\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e548a801-7fa7-4e5d-90ad-f3f4b52686ab\" />\r\n<img width=\"300\" height=\"300\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e0b63ce-8781-4c7d-97a3-b722ef134f4a\" />\r\n\r\n### Fake Rate\r\n\r\nMajor reduction in the jet fake rate in the [1.5,3.0] pseudorapidity region\r\n\r\n<img width=\"300\" height=\"300\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7ca53bb-004d-4faa-85a2-1880880cbc9a\" />\r\n<img width=\"300\" height=\"300\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/83839dce-336e-4a23-b664-ce2ab9b6eadc\" />\r\n\r\n### HGCAL/TICL side\r\n\r\nThese changes leads to a mild drop in the overall efficiency.

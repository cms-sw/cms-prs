In a similar way, the offset with pixel detectors is used to properly display the tomography.\r\n* Updated tests to cope with #22264\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_10_1_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1523019830", "comments": 9, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1522921594", "deletions": 117, "labels": ["backport-ok", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "cf4bfbea05a1bca1098e37021f24e2c01f843ff6", "merged_at": "1523019830", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_1_X", "number": 22858, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "CTPPS: updated DQM for 2018 data taking (10_1_X)", "updated_at": "1523019830", "user": "forthommel"}

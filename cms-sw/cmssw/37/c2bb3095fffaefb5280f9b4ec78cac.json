In a similar way, the offset with pixel detectors is used to properly display the tomography.\r\n* Updated tests to cope with #22264\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_10_1_X", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 6, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1522921594", "deletions": 117, "labels": ["backport-ok", "comparison-available", "dqm-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_1_X", "number": 22858, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "CTPPS: updated DQM for 2018 data taking (10_1_X)", "updated_at": "1522957335", "user": "forthommel"}

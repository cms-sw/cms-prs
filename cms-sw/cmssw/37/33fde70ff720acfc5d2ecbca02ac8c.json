Currently, BTV uses a clone of TopMonitor, which makes it difficult to directly make changes. The new BTVMonitor uses \"pat\" objects instead of \"reco\" objects previously so all the information can be read from miniAOD level.\r\n\r\nInstead of having a new folder for each b-tagging algorithm (which is the case currently), we now have all the b-tagging score histograms in one folder, thus reducing duplicates. The PR also adds b-tagging scores from the UParT tagger for AK4 jets, while keeping all the previously used taggers (DeepJet and ParticleNet)\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThese changes pass all the basic tests suggested in  [CMSSW PR instructions](https://cms-sw.github.io/PRWorkflow.html). Furthermore, the changes are visible in the offline DQM GUI histograms for workflow 16834.0. \r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1740659107", "deletions": 194, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-rejected"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 47472, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "New BTV Monitor", "updated_at": "1740659232", "user": "aniketkhanal"}

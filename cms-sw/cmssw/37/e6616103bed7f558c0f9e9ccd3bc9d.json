It is built on top of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/2056. The merge conflicts are due to the merge conflicts in #2056. The recipe to resolve the conflicts is provided there. Currently the noise rates values for GE2/1 are taken from GE1/1. They will be updated once we have results from GE2/1 simulations. \n", "branch": "CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "changed_files": 125, "closed_at": "1390525024", "comments": 6, "commits": 121, "created_at": "1390000115", "deletions": 2398, "labels": ["geometry-pending", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending", "visualization-pending"], "milestone": "Next CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "number": 2073, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Update gem digitizer for ge21 hits", "updated_at": "1402640125", "user": "dildick"}

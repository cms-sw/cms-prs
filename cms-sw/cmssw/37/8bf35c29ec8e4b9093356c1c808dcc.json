This PR removes the first of these: Reference histograms.\r\n\r\nThe goal is not to remove all of the related code (instead, we will benefit from not having to re-implement it in future), but to remove all usages to see if anything important relies on the references.\r\n\r\nThe main usage are the Kolmogorov and Chi2 based QTests, which are used in many places. However, since we did not have reasonable reference runs set for a long time now, I suspect that all the output based on these is essentially useless. This may not be true for some validation workflows, but then Validation often uses it's own implementation of comparisons.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this PR removes some more old test cases, which happen to be the only usage of some features. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCompiles, and seems to run. However, some references to removed histograms might remain. Also, we need to validate that indeed nobody relies on CMSSW-side references any more.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 50, "closed_at": "1571758453", "comments": 48, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1568974630", "deletions": 3173, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "hlt-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved", "xpog-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "35176b9685b0361db09ba627df8cde4e14d73d09", "merged_at": "1571758453", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 28038, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "DQM: remove support for References inside CMSSW", "updated_at": "1571758453", "user": "schneiml"}

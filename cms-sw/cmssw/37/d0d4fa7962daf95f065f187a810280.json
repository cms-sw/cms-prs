ESProducer \"produce\" functions that return shared_ptr and use the features a shared_ptr provides need special treatment to run properly with concurrent IOVs. By changing ESProducers to return unique_ptr where possible, we make it easier to find those ESProducers that need special treatment both now and in the future. As a side benefit, performance is also slightly better with a unique_ptr.\r\n\r\nThis  PR modifies L1ConfigOnlineProdBase and L1ConfigOnlineProdBaseExt and all the ESProducers that inherit from them.\r\n\r\n(Note that previous PR #25037 was rejected and closed, then split into 3 different PRs. The first two of those PRs included all the changes in CondCore and have now already been merged. This is the 3rd of those PRs and includes only the changes from that PR outside CondCore. But other than that, it has not changed since then)\r\n\r\nThere is also a little bit of cleanup, like deleting unused \"using\" statements around the lines of code modified. And also some unrelated changes added by \"scram b code-checks\".\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 80, "comments": 3, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1544458769", "deletions": 386, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "db-pending", "l1-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_4_X", "number": 25462, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Prepare for concurrent IOVs, L1ConfigOnlineProdBase", "updated_at": "1544459097", "user": "wddgit"}

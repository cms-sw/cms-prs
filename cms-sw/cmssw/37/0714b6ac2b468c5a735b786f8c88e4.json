This fix will workaround the problem by forcing a downcast of `size_t` to `int`, but it would result in a real issue if `secondLegNr` was > 2**32. However, I assume  we would have other problems in that case.\n- Like clang, ICC does not have `constexpr` version for `std::exp` / `std::pow` and in general anything coming from `cmath`. I think this is actually more an unsupported gcc extension.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1422515024", "comments": 20, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1422387100", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["comparison-available", "hlt-approved", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "2f38167dc51b025768f8b02382fd31bb8df16931", "merged_at": "1422515024", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 7406, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "Misc ICC errors fixes.", "updated_at": "1422534682", "user": "ktf"}

Namely, with setup updated in this PR the tau ID with the most recent (2018) training is rerun as a part of nanoAOD sequences for (explicitly listed) past nanoAOD eras, while the tauID with an old (2015) training is read from input miniAOD. For other (new) eras, conversely: the tauID with the old training is rerun, while the one with the new training is read from input miniAOD.\r\n\r\nThis PR reverts changes introduced in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/commit/064713f34928edf6f161753f55266e8f5c698389 and follows discussion in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/31065#issuecomment-682090565\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested with relevant nanoAOD workflows.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1598941033", "comments": 16, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1598876433", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "bug-fix", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved", "xpog-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "6f62f0b97c26e999f02748993ad0e2ee6c41ddd8", "merged_at": "1598941033", "merged_by": "qliphy", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 31302, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix for era modifiers used to rerun anti-e MVA tauID for NanoAOD", "updated_at": "1599066875", "user": "mbluj"}

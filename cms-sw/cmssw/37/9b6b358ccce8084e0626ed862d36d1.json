We have thoroughly checked and came to the conclusion that this modification is the only one needed to achieve the extension of the eta range for tau reconstruction. A cross check on a phase2 workflow has demonstrated that the eta range of reconstructed tau leptons is indeed increased as expected. \r\n\r\nTests of runtime and physics performance and small private validation samples did not reveal any problems as anticipated since the modifications a minimal and not even active for non phase2 GT's\r\n\r\nAs advised by phase2 experts (e.g. Kevin Pedro) we a setting this PR out into the normal 90X development queue. \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nRoger ", "branch": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1484729326", "comments": 10, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1484218556", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "0c18aa069c6ee14b150f258c1c7ef0d263932e68", "merged_at": "1484729326", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "number": 17163, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Increasing eta range for tau reconstruction for phase 2 geometries", "updated_at": "1487932716", "user": "roger-wolf"}

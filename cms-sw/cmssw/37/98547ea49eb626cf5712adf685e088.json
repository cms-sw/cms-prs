The code and algorithm was presented in the last GTT meeting (https://indico.cern.ch/event/1356822/ 2nd entry). I have added new data formats and the core code. The code is tuned for the W->3pi decay. I have made the PR to l1t offline integration branch as well. The review happened in this PR:  https://github.com/cms-l1t-offline/cmssw/pull/1190 . The rebased PR to l1t is here: https://github.com/cms-l1t-offline/cmssw/pull/1209 \r\n\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nGeorge\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 14, "comments": 5, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1708090462", "deletions": 9, "labels": ["l1-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 43998, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Triplet emulator 14 0 0 pre3", "updated_at": "1708109063", "user": "gkaratha"}

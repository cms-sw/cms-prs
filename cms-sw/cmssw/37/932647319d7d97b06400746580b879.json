It takes effect during AOD to MiniAOD step, no change in MiniAOD format output is expected. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis PR has been validated by comparing the inference softmax scores from the direct inference vs the inference made by triton server. \r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nNot a backport.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 9, "closed_at": "1724155933", "comments": 35, "commits": 9, "created_at": "1722253788", "deletions": 142, "labels": ["operations-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "requires-external", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "7b1b7e0cbb50e4e5f7cdbf08e6b68f9e8db64a18", "merged_at": "1724155933", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 45579, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 5, "state": "closed", "title": "Particle Transformer sonic producer", "updated_at": "1724155934", "user": "y19y19"}

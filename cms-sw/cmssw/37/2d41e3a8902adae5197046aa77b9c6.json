Workflow 0.7541 monitors the LST output tracks when LST is used for track building (most direct comparison of LST), i.e. for `alpakaValidationLST,singleIterPatatrack,trackingLST`.\r\n2. Workflow 0.7573 monitors the built tracks in the upcoming new tracking baseline, where LST is used as an extended seeding algorithm (comparison of LST output in a \"production\" configuration), i.e. for `singleIterPatatrack,phase2CAExtension,trackingLST,seedingLST,trackingMkFitCommon,hltTrackingMkFitInitialStep`.\r\n\r\nThe additional CPU reconstruction (`SerialSync`) and comparison plots are implemented with a new procModifier, `alpakaValidationLST`. This procModifier needs to be run only in the procModifier combinations mentioned above to take effect, otherwise it produces neither the additional products nor the comparison plots. It is also included in the `alpakaValidation` modifier chain.\r\n\r\nThe analyzer that produces the comparison plots has been improved with a new parameter option to skip luminosity and PU plots.\r\n\r\nWith the introduction of the `alpakaValidationLST` modifier, the offline workflow testing LST on CPU vs. LST on GPU can be made explicit. The code is changed so that workflow 0.704 runs the offline reconstruction without any additional CPU reconstruction, while a new workflow, 0.7041, runs the comparison.\r\n\r\nSome screenshots of the content of the DQM file:\r\n<img width=\"678\" height=\"654\" alt=\"Screenshot from 2026-01-07 19-38-56\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e61aeba0-219e-4864-b6ec-310b454eba9c\" />\r\n<img width=\"1069\" height=\"736\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/51c2b892-bd45-47f1-9b17-8d7e18da16bd\" />\r\n<img width=\"1069\" height=\"736\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/252c6494-666d-4159-baad-d110993c226d\" />\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 23, "comments": 19, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1768406129", "deletions": 45, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "dqm-pending", "hlt-pending", "operations-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved", "heterogeneous-pending", "tracking"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_1_X", "number": 49832, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 9, "state": "open", "title": "CPU vs. GPU for LST in HLT and updates to the offline", "updated_at": "1768589526", "user": "VourMa"}

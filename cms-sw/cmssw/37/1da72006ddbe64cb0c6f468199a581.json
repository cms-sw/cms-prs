It sets the showershapes to zero so that by default they pass, this makes things easier to build a trigger as it avoids having to OR the ECAL and HGCAL showershape filters (which likely eventually will be made into a single filter but that is not for today).\r\n\r\nNo physics changes are expected, the change in behaviour is a crash is prevented for PhaseII\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nPhaseII E/gamma HLT workflows do not crash.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/32469:  bug fix to run E/gamma HLT Phase-II \r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1608137227", "comments": 10, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1607947814", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["backport-ok", "fully-signed", "hlt-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "7dcace511808ece045d80b8730ead76d4567a11d", "merged_at": "1608137227", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 32470, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "EgHLT Phase-II showershape fix : 11_2_X", "updated_at": "1608137228", "user": "Sam-Harper"}

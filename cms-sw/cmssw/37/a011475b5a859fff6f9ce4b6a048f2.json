(He would know, having written the original code.) This fixes that problem by incorporating noise and zero suppression into the DataMixing step.  Better to correct this now than later!\n\nCode modifications: \n1) Added a new module to the DataMixer to specifically treat Digi combination and noise generation in MC Strip digis.\n2) Reorganization of SimTracker/SiStripDigitizer so that lower-level routines can be used outside of this package (by the DataMixer). No code changes, just locations of code/header files.  \n3) Factorization of SiStrip digitization parameters in SimGeneral/MixingModule so that the parameters themselves can be imported by the DataMixer independent of the Producer definitions.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 26, "closed_at": "1396021891", "comments": 11, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1396009717", "deletions": 118, "labels": ["comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "d06234a96237000da5bb137f47e86bd25dc5d70f", "merged_at": "1396021891", "merged_by": "davidlt", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_0_X", "number": 3069, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "70 x premixing si strip noise fix", "updated_at": "1406544544", "user": "mdhildreth"}

The PR also enhances the EventSetup side tests to exercise both the `appendToDataLabel` parameter, and a case where the product label is set explicitly in the user ESProducer code.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nNone beyond tests in #40813.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

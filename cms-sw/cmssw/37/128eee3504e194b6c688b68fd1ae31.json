The measurement was done with QIE8 in 2003, and the data was re-analyzed for a better extraction of parameters. Since there is no reason for QIE11 and QIE8 timeslews to be different, same parameters are used for both QIE8 and QIE11. \r\n\r\nThe changes in cmssw are \r\n\r\n- The modifier for 2018_HE is removed \r\n- One set of parameters is used for all eras and for both HB and HE. \r\n\r\nThis will affect both data and MC.

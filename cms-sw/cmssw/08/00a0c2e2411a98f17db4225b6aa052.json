If any unphysical pad numbers are discovered for a cluster being processed, cluster is reset to empty value so that it is skipped by the function doing coordinate conversion. The issue is most likely due to unstable GEM links and is currently being investigated. \r\n\r\nSlides with additional information are attached.\r\n[unphysical_gem_pads.pdf](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/files/15475792/unphysical_gem_pads.pdf)\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nEmulator code was run locally to make sure no crashes occur.

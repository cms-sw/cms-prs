The histogram in question show the results of the first 500 HLT Paths in `TriggerResults::HLT` (where 500 is an arbitrary number). In my opinion, this particular histogram is not useful in this part of the DQM (the HLT outputs are already monitored by other dedicated DQM plugins). A similar histogram has led to confusion in #40700 (see also #40788).\r\n\r\nMerely technical. No changes expected, except for the removal of the histogram in question.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

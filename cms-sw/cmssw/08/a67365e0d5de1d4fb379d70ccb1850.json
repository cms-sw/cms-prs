The only errors I see with `runTheMatrix.py` are marked as coming from DAS.\n\nThis will add the 1x1 HF TP in the same collection as 2x3 HF TP, but the RCT already has a check in place to use only 2x3. To actually produce 1x1 TP, new LUT metadata is needed, either by supplying them manually or through a new globaltag. 2x3 production should not be affected by this.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 19, "closed_at": "1450276873", "comments": 51, "commits": 20, "created_at": "1449135526", "deletions": 660, "labels": ["alca-approved", "comparison-available", "db-pending", "geometry-approved", "l1-approved", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "3871d3a2a17541d39837c7d13bcb4d4226d697ee", "merged_at": "1450276873", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 12654, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 9, "state": "closed", "title": "HF 1x1 TP production along 2x3 TP", "updated_at": "1505480535", "user": "matz-e"}

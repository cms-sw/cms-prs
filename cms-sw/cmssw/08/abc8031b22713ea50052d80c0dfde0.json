The goal is ensuring that the fresh-keys identifying the cached data in the squids are not shared with other workflows/processes. In this way, unintended interferences and unwanted data are avoided. \r\n\r\nThe keys will be provided as an external parameter for the read-only ESSource-based workflows, and as the content of a specified file for the update-capable workflows.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nUnit tests and integration tests\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1619160771", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1619097792", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "db-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "577520f038d7c6bbd3afc0d9d3242fe084db1750", "merged_at": "1619160771", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "number": 33505, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Support of private frontier Key for workflow-specific caching", "updated_at": "1619160771", "user": "ggovi"}

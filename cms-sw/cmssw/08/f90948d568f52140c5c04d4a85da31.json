They should be both \"pMinRBXRechitR45EnergyFraction\", as set by the config file:\nhttps://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/CMSSW_7_6_X/RecoMET/METProducers/python/hcalnoiseinfoproducer_cfi.py#L36\n\nThe consequence caused by this inconsistency is that HcalNoiseAlgo::isProblematic(...) function will always returns true:https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/CMSSW_7_6_X/RecoMET/METAlgorithms/src/HcalNoiseAlgo.cc#L203\n\nThus in the RECO step, the RecoMET/METProducers/src/HcalNoiseInfoProducer.cc will regard all RBXs as problematic and store them in the event. This will affect our analysis  since we just want to reach RBXs that are either problematic or of highest energy.\n\nMaybe it's too late to get this code changed in the current reconstruction, it will be helpful if it's fixed in future reReco of data.\n\nThanks\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1442293295", "comments": 10, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1441889425", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "d47e8bd44bb63532cd13d4db5f85dc72508bcfea", "merged_at": "1442293295", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 11225, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "change wrong input tag back to pMinRBXRechitR45EnergyFraction", "updated_at": "1443168944", "user": "allenji"}

Bad response in that region is a general consequence of the lack of charged hadron outside the tracker acceptance), response for 2.3< |eta| < 2.5 moves from -2% to +2%\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1429482401", "comments": 10, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1429354537", "deletions": 66, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "24693a77441c969e838ceacbe1f783e0baaa3cc8", "merged_at": "1429482400", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 8778, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": " Update PF hadron calibration code (same as #8773 from 74X)", "updated_at": "1479106140", "user": "slava77"}

Koss, removes from the ETL TDR description as implemented in scenario D53 the front thermal screen, which is already included in the volume outside ```EndcapTimingLayer```.\r\n\r\nI have taken the opportunity to move the main volume from a polycone to a tubs (i.e. a cyclindrical shell), which is simpler for the geometry navigation.\r\n\r\nThis PR fully embeds #29647, it may be rebased after the integration of that.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n@icosivi has verified the positions and checked that no overlap is present after this update. I have checked that the volume paths and DetIds are identical after the update (as they should), just longitudinal positions are shifted along z (as expected). The initial part of the dump differences is:\r\n\r\n```\r\n6815271a6815272\r\n>  - OCMS[0]/CMSE[1]/CALO[1]/CALOEC[1]/CALOECTSFront[1]/CALOECFront[1]/EndcapTimingLayer[1]/ThermalScreen[1]/\r\n6815298c6815299\r\n< Translation vector components:   -1121.500000      22.925000    2994.325000 \r\n---\r\n> Translation vector components:   -1121.500000      22.925000    3011.325000 \r\n6815300c6815301\r\n< Center global   =   -1121.500000     22.925000   2994.325000 r =    1121.734285 phi =     178.828959\r\n---\r\n> Center global   =   -1121.500000     22.925000   3011.325000 r =    1121.734285 phi =     178.828959\r\n6815302c6815303\r\n< Corner 1 global =   -1110.900000     43.925000   2994.350000 DeltaR =      23.523618\r\n---\r\n> Corner 1 global =   -1110.900000     43.925000   3011.350000 DeltaR =      23.523618\r\n```", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1589349550", "comments": 35, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1589208494", "deletions": 1697, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "bc811af2d6cb9f4b688a5aab3999ce36710aeede", "merged_at": "1589349550", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 29800, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "MTD geometry: remove thermal screen from ETL D53", "updated_at": "1589349550", "user": "fabiocos"}

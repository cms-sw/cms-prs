This PR removes support for these pointers in the EventSetup interface itself. Support for boost::shared_ptr in get_underlying safe() is also being removed. With this PR, boost::shared_ptr is not used anywhere in the framework, and std::auto_ptr is used only in the \"put\" interface for EDProducts, at least once the PR removing auto_ptr from OwnVector is also merged.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": "1460456666", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1460389722", "deletions": 79, "labels": ["comparison-available", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "tests-rejected"], "merge_commit_sha": "afd9cb3a8efe68f6bc1e0fbcee0891794e7f4f7e", "merged_at": "1460456666", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 14018, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Remove EventSetup support for boost::shared_ptr and std::auto_ptr", "updated_at": "1464230058", "user": "wmtan"}

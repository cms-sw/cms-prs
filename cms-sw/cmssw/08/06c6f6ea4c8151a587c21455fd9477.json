A few examples of cmsDriver commands are provided for Run 3 data and simulated samples in the README file. \r\n\r\nThe current PR focuses on Phase 1 L1 objects (unpacked or reemulated), and calorimeter trigger primitives and trigger towers. It is expected to be completed in the future with additional information (e.g. on muon TPs). \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe `cmsDriver.py` commands in the README are found to properly run.

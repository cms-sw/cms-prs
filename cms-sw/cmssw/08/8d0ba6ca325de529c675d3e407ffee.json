It was incorrectly implemented in some Services.\r\n\r\nFor the most part this bug should not affect anything. This affects only jobs using SubProcess in the special case when certain Services have been defined in multiple SubProcesses. There is nothing that I am aware of currently that uses the SubProcess feature. Production does not. RelVal tests do not.\r\n\r\nWe might consider in the future improving the interface for this because 5 of the 10 services using this function had it implemented incorrectly. Although it probably is not worth the effort given how rare it is that a new service with this function is created... (I happened to notice because I was testing a new service. This problem was not reported by a user.)\r\n\r\nThe requirements are:\r\n\r\n1. Definition of isProcessWideService must come before including ServiceMaker.h\r\n2. Must be outside of the relevant class\r\n3. Must be in the edm::service namespace\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI manually tested all 10 of the relevant services. This should have no effect on existing unit tests and RelVal tests.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "comments": 0, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1654627379", "deletions": 20, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "core-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 38279, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Fix isProcessWideService", "updated_at": "1654627401", "user": "wddgit"}

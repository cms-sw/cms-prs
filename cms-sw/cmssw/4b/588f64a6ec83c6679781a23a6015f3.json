This causes  failures to not be reported as failures in the IB.\nIn the ROOT 6 IB, there were approximately 15 test failures that were not noticed until now because of this.\nSince these code changes are not ROOT 6 specific, they are being pull requested in the main 7_3_X branch for code commonality.\nFortunately. all the affected unit tests pass in the 7_3_X IB.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_3_X", "changed_files": 11, "closed_at": "1415692953", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1415645981", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["alca-approved", "comparison-pending", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "a579b0aeb1dadf4bf53d0a0c983f759f2496f2b9", "merged_at": "1415692953", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_3_X", "number": 6317, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "If unit test fails, return a non-zero exit code", "updated_at": "1415730226", "user": "wmtan"}

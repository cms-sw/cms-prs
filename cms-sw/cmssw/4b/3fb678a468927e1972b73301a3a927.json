This is confusing and inconsistent with `EDGetToken` and `EDPutToken`. This PR  changes `EventSetupRecord::getHandleImpl()` to first check if a token is initialized, and then check if the transition is correct.\r\n\r\nIn addition, `scram b code-format` lead to partial reformatting of `EventSetupRecord.h` (perhaps this file was missed in code formatting campaign after a clang version update or something), I included those changes in a separate commit.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nFramework unit tests run.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1599567252", "comments": 21, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1593697391", "deletions": 22, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "6ee16df0260baf2c8517d1bdcdc99d67b7970804", "merged_at": "1599567252", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 30506, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 5, "state": "closed", "title": "Throw a separate exception if ESGetToken is uninitialized", "updated_at": "1599567252", "user": "makortel"}

The first change corresponds to update the list of trigger paths in HLTMuonOfflineAnalyzer so that it includes the new muon pPb triggers. We might also consider to change the pT cut of the Jpsi efficiency plots (see https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/CMSSW_8_1_X/DQMOffline/Trigger/src/HLTMuonMatchAndPlot.cc#L305 ) but this is still under discussion.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1474257975", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1473336263", "deletions": 14, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "b290ab87567e8fe593b8c85a786302e5cda0f34d", "merged_at": "1474257975", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 15780, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Offline DQM for 2016 pPb Muon HLT", "updated_at": "1474257975", "user": "stahlleiton"}

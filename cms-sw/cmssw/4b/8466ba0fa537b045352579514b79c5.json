Fixing that in this PR. This isolation is used in HEEP ID. There could be other use-cases also. This bug/feature affects 2022 and 2023. Before that, this variable was built from caloTowers, where HCal thresholds are generally applied. At the beginning of Run3, EGamma dropped the usage of caloTower, and HCal detector-based isolation variable was built instead from HCal recHits (https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/33666). It's not clear why at that point it was decided to not use the HCal noise thresholds, most probably it's an oversight. In any case, given the HCal noise issues in Run3, which caused severe data/MC disagreement, there is no good reason to not apply the noise cuts which at least helps to some extent to match data and MC better.\r\n\r\nIt was understood in the context of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/43164. Most of the reco differences observed there (https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/43164#issuecomment-1815921379) are likely due to this bug/feature. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested with a Run3 workflow.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1700636724", "deletions": 8, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-rejected"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "number": 43355, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Apply HCal noise thresholds to HCal detector-based isolation of electrons", "updated_at": "1700637401", "user": "swagata87"}

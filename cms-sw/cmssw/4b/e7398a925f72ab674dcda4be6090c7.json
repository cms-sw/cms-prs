A number of features that are not used by the current DQM histograms were removed, a number of bugs and inconsistencies fixed, it is faster than before and yet it should be easier to follow and understand the code now. The new implementation behaves almost the same as the old one, so plugins were only changed to fix bugs uncovered.\r\n\r\n- Second item is a new feature for online, to get histograms that are reset after a few lumisections but always retain some history. Together with a special renderplugin (https://github.com/dmwm/deployment/pull/402) this allows showing multiple, overlaid curves over time, which could be useful especially for detector comissioning.\r\n\r\n- Minor changes include removing the `defaultGrouping` string, which was replaced by a more high-level approach (default specifiactions) and updating the README to reflect this and a bunch of other changes that happened after writing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 21, "closed_at": "1479287424", "comments": 8, "commits": 14, "created_at": "1478511391", "deletions": 795, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 16482, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Phase1 Pixel DQM cleanup and online features", "updated_at": "1479287425", "user": "schneiml"}

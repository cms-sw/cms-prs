If it is not fixed, not only will EDProducts of (unsigned) long long not be able to be put into an event, but there may be other problems, such as using views to look at collections of long long.\n\nThis bug was introduced in 7_0_X. It does not affect prior release cycles.\n\nThis bug is ROOT 5 specific.  While this fix should be carried forward into 7_1_X, it cannot be carried forward to 7_1_ROOT6_X, because TypeWithDict.cc is totally different there.\n\nA unit test has been enhanced so that this problem would have been found.  A separate pull request to 7_1_X will be issued for the unit test because, unlike this fix, the unit test should be carried forward into 7_1_ROOT6_X.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1392022056", "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1391727270", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "40161590c0e4bad942dce2948da042db1e9d49f3", "merged_at": "1392022056", "merged_by": "nclopezo", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_0_0", "number": 2344, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix bug that prevents putting a long long or unsigned long long into an event.", "updated_at": "1392042519", "user": "wmtan"}

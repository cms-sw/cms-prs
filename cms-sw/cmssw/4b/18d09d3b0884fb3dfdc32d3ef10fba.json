The framework appears to be fine with that, thanks to the `edm::Accumulate` feature (thanks @wddgit !).\r\n- Many more configurations had to be updated, see also #21871. More tests might uncover even more.\r\n- Some useless overrides where removed to fix linking issues.\r\n- So far, everything (even online DQM) seems to work. Therefore, there is no \"opt out\" for this conversion for now.\r\n- The new `DQMGlobalEDAnalyzer`, however, is not affected, and might serve as an alternative where the `edm::one` approach does not fit (lots of work done in very few modules -> not enough tasks to keep all threads busy)\r\n- If no opt-out is needed for anything, lots of code could be removed. This is not done yet.\r\n- Update: removed some unneeded methods and fixed a few transitive includes. But there is still a large cleanup in `DQMStore` and `DQMEDAnalyzer` to be done, once we can get rid of streams.\r\n\r\nIf nobody discovers serious problems, this can be merged; otherwise, an opt-out or proper conversion of the respective workflows might be needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 86, "comments": 54, "commits": 20, "created_at": "1518082918", "deletions": 324, "labels": ["alca-pending", "analysis-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "dqm-pending", "fastsim-pending", "l1-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_1_X", "number": 22157, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 7, "state": "open", "title": "Migrate DQM to edm::Accumulator", "updated_at": "1518600635", "user": "schneiml"}

It supports sub nanosecond precision in the ECAL signal pulses and is fully configurable from the DB, in view of the Phase II upgrade where the detector will have a shorter pulse shape. More details can be found in my ECAL DPG presentation:\r\n\r\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/731948/\r\n\r\nThe new shape class supports also the old style Phase-I logic that makes no attempt to fetch information from the DB. In this pull request the code is committed with the DB usage currently de-activated, to allow easier approval of the PR. A second PR is foreseen once this PR is approved (and thus also the new DB Ecal Object can go in the global tag), to actually enable the DB configuration and read the conditions from the corresponding global tag.\r\n\r\nI have validated the resulting output with a small scale ZEE MC production as well as a dedicated tool that instantiates ad-hoc pulses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 40, "closed_at": "1532456486", "comments": 78, "commits": 10, "created_at": "1529075513", "deletions": 700, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "db-approved", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "f6ce7a4912518b3486d97034e96ecb8139f394d3", "merged_at": "1532456486", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_3_X", "number": 23600, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 42, "state": "closed", "title": "Ecal shape db", "updated_at": "1532456486", "user": "theofil"}

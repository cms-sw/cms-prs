While declaring an undefined function is legal in C++, it is fatal to the build of a ROOT5 dictionary for the class.\nNote:  The corresponding PR for this in CMSSW_7_4_X is #11210.\nPlease merge this in a timely manner so CMSSW_7_4_ROOT5_X will be usable.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_ROOT5_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1442326978", "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1441817937", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "2ff99d46d73709a770c57d778587d643989b29df", "merged_at": "1442326978", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "number": 11211, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix Build problems due to ROOT issues", "updated_at": "1442422559", "user": "wmtan"}

This boolean flag serves the purpose of overriding the three checks in StripSubClusterShapeTrajectoryFilter module which introduced inefficiencies in tracking performance. These inefficiencies arise due to the uniform shape of the approximated clusters.  The problem-causing filters were the \"saturated\", \"trimming\" and \"peak finder\" filters with the latter two requiring information on the trajectory state on the surface at the measurement layer which is not available during clustering.\r\n\r\nThis PR utilises information on the beamspot, tracker geometry, and strip module to approximate the global position of the cluster and the track direction. The latter is done by drawing a vector from the beamspot to the cluster barycenter.  A boolean for the 3 filters is then set up using this information following the logic in the StripSubClusterShapeTrajectoryFilter module. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis PR was tested by running workflows 11884.0 and 11941.0 (step3). The DQM outputs have been checked and compared to the original clusters to compare any performance gains from this new implementation.\r\n\r\n@mmusich @mtosi \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 410, "comments": 58, "commits": 268, "created_at": "1685475199", "deletions": 220825, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "dqm-pending", "l1-pending", "hlt-pending", "core-pending", "analysis-pending", "alca-pending", "daq-pending", "db-pending", "generators-pending", "geometry-pending", "operations-pending", "visualization-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-approved", "xpog-pending", "heterogeneous-pending", "tracking", "trk"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_2_X", "number": 41815, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 30, "state": "open", "title": "Adding filter flag to SiStripApproximateClusters", "updated_at": "1687256292", "user": "Ksavva1021"}

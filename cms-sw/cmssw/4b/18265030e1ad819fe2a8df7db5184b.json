This entailed populating a `TkHistoMap` with the occupancy of modules in FEDError per event, but this approach had two problems:\r\n   * the filling of the map occurred in the `endJob` transition of `StripHitEfficiencyWorker` (that in a `DQMEDAnalyzer` is not run by the framework, resulting in empty maps cf https://tinyurl.com/2p5tdgqs)\r\n   * secondly the information was never propagated to the `SiStripHitEfficiencyHarvester` such that those modules could be excluded from the list of inefficient ones.\r\n   \r\nThis PR solves the issue by changing the `SiStripHitEffData` ancillary `struct` and its usage in the classes of the `SiStripHitEfficiency` PCL workflow. A somewhat arbitrary threshold of 75% of the events is used to flag modules that have problems with FEDErrors, permanently excluding them from the computation.\r\n\r\nFinally I profit of this to transform a relic thread-unsafe `cout` to the message logging system in commit c044bae8d9a0fc3c2f586b88b07cb0206ef30f79.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRun the following commands:\r\n\r\n```console\r\ncmsDriver.py stepReAlCa -s ALCA:PromptCalibProdSiStripHitEff --conditions 124X_dataRun3_Express_v5 --scenario pp --data --era Run3 --datatier ALCARECO --eventcontent ALCARECO --processName=ReAlCa -n 100000 --dasquery='file dataset=/StreamExpress/Run2022D-SiStripCalMinBias-Express-v2/ALCARECO run=357898' --nThreads=4\r\n``` \r\n\r\nfollowed by:\r\n\r\n```console\r\ncmsDriver.py stepHarvest -s ALCAHARVEST:SiStripHitEff --conditions 124X_dataRun3_Express_v5 --scenario pp --data --era Run3 --filein file:PromptCalibProdSiStripHitEff.root -n -1\r\n```\r\n\r\nwith this branch and without it and observed the following features:\r\n   - the `FEDErrorTkDetMaps` folder now contains full plots (as can be checked at https://tinyurl.com/2z7nrg9a after logging with ` ssh -NL 8060:localhost:8060 <USER>@lxplus724.cern.ch`)\r\n   - some regions in TEC that were contributing to the inefficiency (because in FED Error) are now correctly excluded:\r\n   \r\n| Name     | Pre-fix | Post-fix |\r\n| ---           | ---       |  ---       |\r\n| Efficiency Map |  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5082376/189116210-0ae09a44-229d-4f62-aed4-67560532e47e.png) | ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5082376/189123336-dc252a86-28dc-4a4f-b6fc-a5bfc026f20a.png) |\r\n| Inefficient Modules       |   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5082376/189116635-ae39f26d-122a-42c9-a2d5-534a8a570e56.png) | ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5082376/189116575-f2ee86ae-e510-402c-920d-864c1b182149.png) |\r\n  \r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

In theory there are other files that reference these operating points \r\n(https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=WINTER16&type=) that this PR could also update, but I am not sure if this is appropriate.\r\n\r\nThe new prescription does not require the definition of a Charged EM Fraction (CEF) cut for the operating point here, so this has been taken out of the jetid definition.  The other options would be to keep it and set the CEF cut to at >=1 or set ignoreCut(indexCEF_).", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1520595011", "comments": 34, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1519400609", "deletions": 18, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "orp-approved", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "3ae82f0acb7ee09b733be0fa8d9db8e19c1b4824", "merged_at": "1520595011", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_1_X", "number": 22323, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Jet ID update to the Run2017 prescription", "updated_at": "1520595011", "user": "knash"}

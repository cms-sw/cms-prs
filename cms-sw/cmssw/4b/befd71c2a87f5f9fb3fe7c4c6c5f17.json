The appropriate training to be used is selected automatically. The idea is that the variable name will stay the same in the future, selecting a new training when appropriate.\r\n- No need to store working points as bools since these can be easily derived from the MVA value.\r\n\r\n- In addition to this PR: renaming mva Egamma IDs to be more generic \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n- Tested in CMSSW_12_4_0_pre1; verified that the new variable is added correctly.\r\n- Adds 1 float per electron.\r\n\r\n@namapane @swagata87  pls follow\r\n\r\n*this PR is a repeated clean version of previous PR (https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/37429)", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1658154197", "comments": 44, "commits": 8, "created_at": "1655106867", "deletions": 44, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved", "xpog-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "72051cc21e8bdf716380eea557bea9f4643e0d57", "merged_at": "1658154197", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 38355, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 4, "state": "closed", "title": "Adding HZZ electron MVA ID", "updated_at": "1658154197", "user": "asculac"}

However I thought it would be nice to have the rest of the PR available to also receive comments rather than waiting to explore that suggestion.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n```\r\n hltIntegrationTests v3-test/run3:/dev/CMSSW_12_0_0/Fake -s /dev/CMSSW_12_0_0/GRun -i /store/data/Run2018D/EphemeralHLTPhysics1/RAW/v1/000/323/790/00000/15FD6507-9B9A-DE49-973B-B63C4DEDC226.root -x  \"--globaltag auto:run3_hlt\" --dbproxy \r\nhltGetConfiguration v3-test/run3:/dev/CMSSW_12_0_0/Fake --dbproxy\r\nhltConfigFromDB --configName /dev/CMSSW_12_0_0/GRun/V1  --dbproxy --v3-test --run3\r\n```\r\ncommands all work as expected at RAL (ie very much off the cern network)\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nbackport of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/35987\r\n\r\nusers will be still be using this release for a while and will need HLT services such as this\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "changed_files": 7, "comments": 13, "commits": 8, "created_at": "1636451159", "deletions": 34, "labels": ["hlt-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "backport-ok"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "number": 36052, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "open", "title": "Adding Proxy Support to hltGetConfiguration and fixing converter/db specification bugs with hltIntegrationTests: 12_0_X", "updated_at": "1636726437", "user": "Sam-Harper"}

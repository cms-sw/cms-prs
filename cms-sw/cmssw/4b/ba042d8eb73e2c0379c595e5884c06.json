Most framework uses of GUIDs were switched to using random GUIDs due to UUID collisions in containers.  This PR makes the same switch for DQMIO, and also restores the registration of DQMIO input files to the FJR.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nPasses tests.  There's more validation I'd like to do, but I'm pushing this out now as there's high demand for a fix for this issue.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nThis is not a backport.  Backports to 12_3_0 and 12_2_0 will follow shortly.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 7, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1648589987", "deletions": 10, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "bug-fix", "urgent", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 37405, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "open", "title": "Avoid DQMIO file GUID collisions", "updated_at": "1648636087", "user": "dan131riley"}

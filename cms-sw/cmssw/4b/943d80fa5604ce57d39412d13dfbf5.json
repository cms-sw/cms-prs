SimHits, Digis, RecHits (@tmengke, @deguio, @skunori)\r\n\r\nAs part of the Validation of campaigns regularly announced from PdmV and UPSG, we want to monitor and validate SimHits, Digis and Rechits objects. Usually, RelMon and DQM GUI is being used for this task. However, in order to quantify the performance of certain clustering algorithms or optimizing the same algorithm or checking different calibration algorithms or inspect the plots in the DQM file easier, we include in our webpage results from the above mentioned objects.\r\n\r\n@bsunanda: This slightly touches the [HGCalSimHitValidation.cc](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/Validation/HGCalValidation/plugins/HGCalSimHitValidation.cc), [HGCalDigiValidation.cc](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/Validation/HGCalValidation/plugins/HGCalDigiValidation.cc), [HGCalRecHitValidation.cc](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/Validation/HGCalValidation/plugins/HGCalRecHitValidation.cc) by adding a zero to the names of the DQM histograms, so the results in our web page to be ordered by layer number. \r\n\r\n2. Multiclusters (@rovere, @felicepantaleo, @apsallid, @amartelli)\r\n\r\nWith the inclusion of TICL multiclusters in CMSSW being imminent, we update the HGCalValidator package with the capability of monitoring as well as associating MultiClusters wiith CaloParticles. In the HGCal webpage [1] there is a \"Validation\" section where we document and describe all the relevant plots. This is a first work based on the standard \"hgcalMultiClusters\" object that if needed will be refined in the very near future with the study of the TICL multiclusters. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nWe tested locally that all objects plots are populated [2-4] and will continue the validation of the code as soon as TICL multiclusters are available.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\n\r\nNot a backport.\r\n\r\n[1] http://hgcal.web.cern.ch/hgcal/\r\n\r\n[2] http://tmengke.web.cern.ch/tmengke/HGCHitValidation_front/\r\n\r\n[3] http://apsallid.web.cern.ch/apsallid/HGCValidmulticlusters_testing/\r\n\r\n[4] http://apsallid.web.cern.ch/apsallid/HGCValidlayerclusters_testing/\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 13, "closed_at": "1561616759", "comments": 13, "commits": 45, "created_at": "1561455952", "deletions": 576, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "08b90622752cf9ab4b16e9177d20e54c439a363e", "merged_at": "1561616759", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27337, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "[HGCal] Updating HGCalValidator with SimHits, Digis, RecHits and MultiClusters", "updated_at": "1561616760", "user": "apsallid"}

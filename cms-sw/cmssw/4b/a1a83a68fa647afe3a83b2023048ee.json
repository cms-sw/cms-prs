This is a relevant parameter in the core of the jets, where the efficiency drops. Only tracks with dR lower than 0.1 in jets of Pt above 1 TeV are included in the calculation of the efficiency by default.\r\n@arizzi ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 9, "comments": 8, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1545146828", "deletions": 30, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-notrun", "dqm-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-rejected"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_4_X", "number": 25514, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "open", "title": "Implementation of DQM plot: tracking efficiency VS dR(track, jet)", "updated_at": "1545147903", "user": "vberta"}

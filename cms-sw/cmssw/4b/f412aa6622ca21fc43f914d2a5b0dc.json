In the code in the CMSSW repository, this parameter\r\nis set true in only one standalone configuration which we believe to be no longer used.\r\n\r\nWe considered deleting the code related to this option, but there seemed to be some\r\nvery small doubt about whether this code was used or not so we decided an exception\r\nthrow with a descriptive message would be a safer option than simply deleting it.\r\n\r\nPossibly someday in the future, this part of the code can be deleted and cleaned up if\r\nno problems are reported.\r\n\r\nSee Issue #43697 for more details.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRelies on existing tests. The only possible change in behavior is an exception throw.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1706112960", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["l1-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "number": 43779, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Disable the getFedFromOmds configuration option in L1RCTProducer", "updated_at": "1706112986", "user": "wddgit"}

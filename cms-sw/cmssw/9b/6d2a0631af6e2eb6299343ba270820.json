Currently TICL can be seeded by general tracks, which is fine for offline reco but too slow for EGM HLT, hence we are not using it. We use globally seeded TICL EM iteration. It was found in preliminary studies that the trackster production step runs faster if we replace global seeding by L1 seeding. \r\n\r\n2) options to produce reduced recHit and reduced digi collections for HGCAL. Currently the layercluster production step at EGM HLT takes some time to run, as it runs on all HGCAL recHits. We want to run the layercluster production step on a reduced recHit collection, ie, only the recHits around L1 e/gamma objects. The reduced digi is not being used currently, but can be used later if needed.\r\n\r\n3) a producer code to filter phase2 L1 collection based on hardware quality. The reduced recHit producer will take the filtered L1 collection with good quality L1 objects, and will keep the recHits around them. \r\n\r\n[with thanks to @Sam-Harper]\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nrunTheMatrix.py -l 23234.0 #2026D49 ttbar (HLT TDR baseline w/ HGCal v11)\r\nrunTheMatrix.py -l 11634.0 #2021 ttbar\r\n\r\n\r\nA backport to 11_1_X will be needed for HLT TDR.

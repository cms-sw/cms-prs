However 3 of them (ak4PF, ak4PFCHS, ak8PFCHS) were kept because otherwise it failed to pass the validation step. But in that case it was later found that the sequences crashes if stopped after RECO step due to the absence of pfNoPileUpJME used by the 3 mentioned algorithms. Trivial solution would be to add back pfNoPileUpJME. But in order to speed-up reconstruction it was replaced by a dummy EDFilter with a very high pt threshold which results in an empty input for these 3 jet modules. The filter does not prevent the modules to be run, but since they have no input objects they do nothing.\r\n\r\n@cfmcginn @mandrenguyen", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 26, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1537877889", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_3_X", "number": 24655, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "open", "title": "Fixing RECO in pp_on_AA era jet reconstruction", "updated_at": "1538491564", "user": "stepobr"}

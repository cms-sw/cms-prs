This product includes  non-zero suppressed Tracker FEDs and may be the cause why in some HI runs, DQM streamer files are way over the 2GB limit. Therefore, we tested the DQM client codes with a test streamer that does not contain `FEDRawDataCollection_rawDataCollector_*_*` and see if any DQM client crashes. We found the crash of this client `fed_dqm_sourceclient-live` could be easily fixed with the change of inputTag for `hcalFEDIntegrityTask.tagFEDs`. \r\n\r\nWith this update, the client `fed_dqm_sourceclient-live` could run on streamers that either include rawDataCollector or not. The PR does not rely on other PRs.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nThis PR was tested at DQM playback machines at p5 using the following streamers and run_key=hi_run, pp_run or cosmic_run. The DQM clients ran without crashing and we could see output FED histograms. For run 375252, we also ran at lxplus and compare the histograms in the output root files with this PR change (taking rawDataRepacker as input) and the default fed_dqm_sourceclient-live_cfg.py (taking rawDataCollector as input). The output histograms are identical to each other.\r\n\r\n362321 --> hi_run, test streamer without `FEDRawDataCollection_rawDataCollector_*_*`\r\n373710 --> pp_run \r\n375252 --> hi_run\r\n375668 --> cosmic_run\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 0, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1698313406", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_3_X", "number": 43120, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Online DQM fed client: use rawDataRepacker for HCAL FEDIntegrity Task in HI runs", "updated_at": "1698313465", "user": "syuvivida"}

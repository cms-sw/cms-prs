As temporary workaround, we remove their usage in simulation, falling back to the old description of the noise, as agreed with @Dr15Jones at the last ORP.\n\nNew set of Global Tags in view of second pre-release of 73X release cycle.\n- Run1 and Run2 simulations:\n  - added `DYTThresholdObject` payloads with dummy values as currently in configuration, in order to consume them properly from the GT. The values are different for Run1 and Run2 as they account for different geometries. No changes expected for Muon POG\n  - removed `HcalCholeskyMatrices` payloads.\n- Run1 and Run2 data:\n  - added `DYTThresholdObject` payloads with dummy values as currently in configuration, in order to consume them properly from the GT.

This PR corrects it. This only concerns the wfs with digi morphing turned on. Since it is turned off by default, we expect no changes. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles. `runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos` is running and result will be reported here. Since this is a very simple change, we are opening the PR before these finish in the interest of time.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

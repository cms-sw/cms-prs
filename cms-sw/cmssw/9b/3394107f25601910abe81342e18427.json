This swaps a lot of Calo Layer 1 Infrastructure pointers over to `std::shared_ptr`'s to try and avoid memory leak issues. Summary card regions are now stored as the objects themselves, instead of pointers to them (That decision may not be directly necessary? It makes sense to me, and there is a spot where pointers to these things are used internally, and `nullptr`s are possible but checked against)\r\n\r\nThis is just a first pass, but a larger fix of all of this infrastructure with smart pointers should be considered.\r\n\r\n@mmusich @makortel \r\n\r\n### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles, and has had formatting applied\r\n\r\nTo be updated with further tests.

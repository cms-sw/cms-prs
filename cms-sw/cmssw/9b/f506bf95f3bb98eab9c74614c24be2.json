Any EcalRecHits added by the new clusters are added directly to the reduced collection.    \r\n\r\nThis custom workflow goes through most of PF mustache photon sequence, starting at PFRecHits and removing the time cleaning, then to PFClusters, PFSuperClusters, and lastly straight from PFSuperClusters to photons. \r\n\r\nAt the PFSuperCluster producer, we filter on the seed crystal being flagged OOT to reduce duplication of clusters and superclusters.  As such, this collection will only store photons whose seed is flagged OOT.  Since we do not go through the full gedPhoton sequence, we do not do any PF isolations.\r\n\r\nThe increase to CPU is roughly 0.3%, while the increase in compressed size at AOD is about 1.5 kB  from the new collections + additional rechits.  Just taking an ls -l and dividing by the number of events processed, the estimated increase in size is 4.5 kB / event. \r\n\r\nThis work will be presented tomorrow at the EGM Reco meeting -- I will attach slides after the meeting.

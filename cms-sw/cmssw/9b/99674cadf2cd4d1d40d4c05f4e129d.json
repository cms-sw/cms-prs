The plots shows how the energy scale in the gap is now better corrected (Ecal module boundaries are indicated with dashed lines).\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5707503/12816634/b5abd5c8-cb4d-11e5-8485-89c8866157b4.png)\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1454596889", "comments": 4, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1454591923", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-rejected", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 13189, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix photon regression inputs missing variables", "updated_at": "1454596889", "user": "fcouderc"}

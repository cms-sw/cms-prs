ZDCdet id's, unpacker, topology, and geometry all updated for the change. Note that the \"main\" zdc (the em and had sections previously in castor) will remain readout through castor until after the pPb run. RPD runs on qie10s, so it is processed identically to HF.\n\nBackport to 80X coming soon.\n\n-Chris\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 20, "closed_at": "1477499077", "comments": 105, "commits": 9, "created_at": "1475918949", "deletions": 125, "labels": ["alca-approved", "comparison-available", "db-approved", "geometry-approved", "hold", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "1fe469ed9cd8d251a2c5135b564354d7ba822004", "merged_at": "1477499077", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 16150, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 28, "state": "closed", "title": "RPD implemented in 81X", "updated_at": "1477508328", "user": "cferraio"}

For those cases where there is no Phi/Theta partner, 4 best quality single Phi/Theta digis are saved and counterpart in pair is set to default values of the constructor digi class. \r\n[1] Requires df_extended>0 in L1Trigger/DTTriggerPhase2/plugins/DTTrigPhase2Prod.cc\r\n\r\n- Add DT Phase Digi pair produciton to the standard L1 Trigger sequence\r\n\r\n- Add DT Phase2 Digi and Digi pair collections to the L1 Trigger default Event Content\r\n\r\n- General cleaning of the code\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nLocal validation within CMSSW and w.r.t. firmware (w.i.p.)\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 16, "comments": 6, "commits": 17, "created_at": "1765359715", "deletions": 26, "labels": ["l1-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved", "changes-dataformats"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_0_X", "number": 49589, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[L1T] DT Trigger Phase-2 Analytical Method (AM) v2.3", "updated_at": "1765361354", "user": "jfernan2"}

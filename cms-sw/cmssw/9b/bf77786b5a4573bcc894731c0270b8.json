I'm planning to add a third variant (reading tracks through View), and without the refactoring the code would become even more messy. I also took the opportunity to do a similar refactoring of the configuration parameters. I took this separate from the other developments in the hope of smoother integration for purely technical changes.\n\nTested in CMSSW_7_5_X_2015-06-14-2300, no changes expected in results.\n\n@rovere @VinInn \n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1435250115", "comments": 12, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1434545950", "deletions": 144, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "252c4979a68caed5ad2acd12c3b7f13d4a0bafc1", "merged_at": "1435250115", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 9658, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Refactor RecoTrackSelector and RecoTrackRefSelector", "updated_at": "1476956379", "user": "makortel"}

(Of course, in the path : DQM/L1TMonitor/interface/L1TStage2uGT.h, we simply add the new histograms) These changes are mentioned to add some extra plots according to specific L1 Trigger bits (L1_FirstCollisionInTrain and L1_LastCollisionInTrain). So, after I initialize three plots, I used the last two trigger bits, as I mentioned, to fill them. The first plot which called first_bunch, selecting only the L1_FirstCollisionInTrain, is filled with all the algorithm trigger bits (y-axis) and BX (x-axis), the second plot which called last_bunch, selecting only the L1_LastCollisionInTrain, is filled with all the algorithm trigger bits (y-axis) and BX (x-axis), and the last plot called isolated_bunch is filled selecting simultaneously L1_FirstCollisionInTrain and L1_LastCollisionInTrain, is filled with all the algorithm trigger bits (y-axis) and BX (x-axis).", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 689, "closed_at": "1508326446", "comments": 2, "commits": 703, "created_at": "1508326411", "deletions": 264314, "labels": ["alca-pending", "analysis-pending", "code-checks-rejected", "comparison-pending", "core-pending", "db-pending", "dqm-pending", "fastsim-pending", "generators-pending", "hlt-pending", "l1-pending", "new-package-pending", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending", "upgrade-pending", "visualization-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_9_4_X", "number": 20960, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": " Dedicated timing plots for L1T objects- Online DQM & L1T", "updated_at": "1508329275", "user": "dtsitson"}

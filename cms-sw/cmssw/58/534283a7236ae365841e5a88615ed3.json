If it is not told to add a collection, then it will not be available to the accumulators in the PileUpEventPrincipal, even if the collection is in the input file.  All collections for the signal event are always available.\n\nBefore this pull request only calorimeter hits from the signal event were digitised by the HGCal digitisers.\n\n@lgray, @pfs\n", "branch": "CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1405852680", "comments": 6, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1405594419", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "2fbc05e2c205ca678a893e71ce4762365455df0f", "merged_at": "1405852680", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "number": 4691, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add the HGCal calorimeter collections to the pileup mix", "updated_at": "1427127089", "user": "mark-grimes"}

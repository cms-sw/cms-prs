For the time being, it's not run in production, but it has been tested.\r\nPattern Recognition parameters have been moved directly into the corresponding plugins.\r\n\r\nExpect no regression.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTypical single-particle workflows related to HGCAL. Tested enabling and disabling `CLUE3D`.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 21, "closed_at": "1622121394", "comments": 30, "commits": 35, "created_at": "1620294528", "deletions": 102, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "operations-approved", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "4162d663e22fea5b83ddac199d0e9e15f4a2fad2", "merged_at": "1622121394", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "number": 33645, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 28, "state": "closed", "title": "[HGCAL] Pattern Recognition as Plugins, with CLUE3D addition.", "updated_at": "1622121394", "user": "rovere"}

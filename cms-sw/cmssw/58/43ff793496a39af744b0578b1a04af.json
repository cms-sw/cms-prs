It solves collisions in dense ID for 2017 by marking Hcal trigger towers with `abs(ieta) == 29 && version == 0` as invalid. HCAL HE in 2017 will not include a tower at `ieta` 29, and neither will HCAL HF.\n\n@bsunanda, can you have a look at this?\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1471236474", "comments": 11, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1470726940", "deletions": 26, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "1add2178b20f9bd2f3f2ad9cdd04f72473069898", "merged_at": "1471236474", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 15395, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Recover 2016 Hcal Trigger Primitives", "updated_at": "1472194536", "user": "matz-e"}

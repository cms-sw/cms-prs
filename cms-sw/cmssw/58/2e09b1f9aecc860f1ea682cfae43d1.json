In this format it is significantly easier to use, particularly in fwlite.  The name could probably be better and I'm happy to rename it to anything else. L1TrackTruthPair for example. \r\n\r\nIt also adds the rec-hit counts to the e/gamma HLT debug format as these are used in the regressions and thus need to be stored. \r\n\r\nOnce https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/32910 is merged, then I'll submit the 11_1_X flavour\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nUsed extensively for E/g HLT phase-II development. Test shows this produces the expected output\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 8, "closed_at": "1614411180", "comments": 22, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1613354291", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "hlt-approved", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "d307dbb42a8c0d5bac18c09d189e89513dd4f691", "merged_at": "1614411180", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 32911, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Extending E/gamma HLT Debug to phaseII and adding rec-hit counts: 11_3_X", "updated_at": "1614411180", "user": "Sam-Harper"}

These HLT triggers are not storing any information in the hltobject trees, even though the events are being triggered. After investigating, we have identified that the problem lies with HLTEgammaCombMassFilter.\r\n\r\nI have made some modifications to HLTEgammaCombMassFilter, and now the information is being stored in hltobject.\r\n\r\nSee slides: https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/pub/CMS/HLT_HIon_Run3/pinchun20230928.pdf (P.8)\r\n\r\nBackport PR:\r\nhttps://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/44746 (14_0_X)", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 8, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1713455665", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["hlt-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "bug-fix", "code-checks-rejected", "egamma"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 44778, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "store the hltobjects for Mass50 triggers", "updated_at": "1714636811", "user": "pinchunchou"}

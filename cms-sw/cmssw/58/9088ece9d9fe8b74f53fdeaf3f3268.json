The PR also adds a new runTheMatrix workflow (250202.185) that uses this new data format. With this PR integrated, it will be easier to perform validation and compare performance of different pixel charge reweighting approaches.

No changes are expected in the standard runTheMatrix workflows because the late charge reweighting is not used by default.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nBackports will likely be needed but it remains to be seen to how many earlier release cycles. This will depend on the details of the validation procedure.\r\n\r\n@carolinecollard \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 16, "comments": 3, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1733417917", "deletions": 42, "labels": ["simulation-pending", "operations-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-approved", "trk", "changes-dataformats"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_0_X", "number": 46884, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "open", "title": "Run-dependent pixel simulation using additionally compressed SimHit info", "updated_at": "1733479272", "user": "ferencek"}

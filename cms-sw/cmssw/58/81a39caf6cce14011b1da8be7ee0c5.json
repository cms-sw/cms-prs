The relval data GT in CMSSW is used to test PCL workflows, so the tags involved into the PCL workflow have to be prompt synced or maybe pcl synced in the relval data GT\r\n\r\n2. The Prompt-Like data GT with HE sector failure contains a tag for PPS alignment. This tag needs to be removed because the current PPS alignment ES producer uses alignment from local XML file.\r\nIn addition, the prompt synced tags with the same payloads are used in Prompt-Like GT to be on the safe side.\r\n\r\nThe following GT updates are included :\r\n### Offline relval data GT\r\nThe updated GT is\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/list/Prod/gts/105X_dataRun2_relval_v6\r\nDiff :\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/105X_dataRun2_relval_v6/105X_dataRun2_relval_v5\r\n\r\n- ECAL pedestal changes from prompt to offline\r\n\r\n### Prompt like data GT with HE sector failure\r\nThe updated GT is\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/list/Prod/gts/105X_dataRun2_PromptLike_HEfail_v5\r\nDiff :\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/105X_dataRun2_PromptLike_HEfail_v5/105X_dataRun2_PromptLike_HEfail_v3\r\n\r\n- remove PPS alignment tag which has conflict with the current PPS alignment ES producer\r\n- use prompt synced PPS timing tag with the same payloads as the offline synced one to be on the safer side\r\n\r\n### Prompt like data GT with HE sector failure\r\nThe updated GT is\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/list/Prod/gts/105X_dataRun2_PromptLike_v6\r\nDiff :\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/105X_dataRun2_PromptLike_v6/105X_dataRun2_PromptLike_v5\r\n\r\n- use prompt synced PPS timing tag with the same payloads as the offline synced one to be on the safer side\r\n- remove unlabelled pixel 2D template because it is used at nowhere\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1550333056", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["alca-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-started"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_5_X", "number": 25961, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Fix ECAL pedestal tag to be prompt sync and remove PPS alignment tag in GT", "updated_at": "1550333565", "user": "tocheng"}

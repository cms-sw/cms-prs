It was checked that all newly added dependencies are actually required by the package with `git grep`.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 42, "closed_at": "1598338742", "comments": 41, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1597764106", "deletions": 181, "labels": ["alca-approved", "analysis-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "db-approved", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "hlt-approved", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "9aa3f20255b6a231ccce67b6ff45ce7494652ce7", "merged_at": "1598338742", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 31165, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 17, "state": "closed", "title": "Clean BuildFiles up to DataFormats", "updated_at": "1598338742", "user": "guitargeek"}

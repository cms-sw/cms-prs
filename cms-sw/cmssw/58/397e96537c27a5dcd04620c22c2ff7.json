In the migration to using tbb::task_group we would like to do away with pushAndWait.\r\n\r\nThere is one visible change seen by this PR, the TriggerResults EDProducer internal to the framework no longer sends a pre/post prefetch signal as it has no need for prefetching. This makes it behave like the EDProducers handling the individual Path results.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe code compiles and all framework unit tests pass.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 15, "closed_at": "1609973854", "comments": 7, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1609938353", "deletions": 388, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "74d07a42ff3ec5f5adf49bcfc4e43bc2969d5f15", "merged_at": "1609973854", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 32607, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Reduce use of Worker::doWork", "updated_at": "1609973854", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

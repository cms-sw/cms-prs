In this PR, if this is a merge job and fast cloning is disabled for this first file, then compression and basket sizes are forwarded to the output file.  Also, the basket size for the EventAuxiliary branch is bumped in order to improve the data layout for sites with large block sizes.\r\n\r\nThis PR will actually make the merge job memory consumption worse, but will improve the compression and layout of the output files.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTests are ok, changes are purely technical in the setting of various ROOT IO parameters.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 7, "comments": 0, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1638209874", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["core-pending", "operations-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_2_X", "number": 36287, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "forward compression settings if fast cloning is disabled on first file of a merge", "updated_at": "1638209894", "user": "dan131riley"}

We can merge this PR now (without testing these new wfs, which might be dangerous). Once 9_4_11_cand1 is built, we will produce the missing MinBias dataset and test the wfs. \r\n2. We build 9_4_11_cand1 without this PR, and produce the MinBias dataset with 9_4_11_cand1. At that time, this PR can be tested and it will merged for the next release.

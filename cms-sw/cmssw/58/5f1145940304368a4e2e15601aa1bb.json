We'll need to use the private headers for awhile to rebase to the latest external (prior to converting the new client).\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_2_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1407415848", "comments": 17, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1407249605", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "a7340ba869bdba0f463b9b42d3da401c920c338f", "merged_at": "1407415848", "merged_by": "degano", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_2_X", "number": 4882, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add explicit header that is no longer brought in by default.", "updated_at": "1407415848", "user": "bbockelm"}

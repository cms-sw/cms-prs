An older version of this format - [`PPSAlignmentConfig`](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/CondFormats/PPSObjects/interface/PPSAlignmentConfig.h) - was uploaded to CMSSW in #31728 and fixed in #34844, but since it required some modifications, a new format had to be created. Although the obsolete `PPSAlignmentConfig` class and its record cannot be removed, this PR removes its ESProducer and serialization tests.\r\n\r\nMain modifications:\r\n- some parameters were moved to [`PPSAlignmentHarvester`](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/CalibPPS/AlignmentGlobal/plugins/PPSAlignmentHarvester.cc) config,\r\n- added a couple of new parameters to e.g. increase efficiency for low-statistics data,\r\n- deleted a few redundant parameters,\r\n- added a new parameter - `extraParams` that for now will be empty, but will be used in case any new parameters need to be added to the class. It is not planned, but still might be necessary.\r\n\r\nThis is not the last PR in PPS global alignment roadmap for Run 3. The next PR will include updates to [`PPSAlignmentWorker`](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/CalibPPS/AlignmentGlobal/plugins/PPSAlignmentWorker.cc) and [`PPSAlignmentHarvester`](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/CalibPPS/AlignmentGlobal/plugins/PPSAlignmentHarvester.cc), define a new matrix test and add a few files required by PCL. The whole strategy was presented in the [AlCaDB meeting on 30 August](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1069114/). Note that the naming was changed from `PPSAlignmentConfigRun3v1` to `PPSAlignmentConfiguration` after the presentation.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a serialization test (`testSerializationPPSAlignmentConfiguration`). It also adds modules that store a `PPSAlignmentConfiguration` object in an SQLite file, and then retrieve the data from it. I was able to run these modules and retrieve correct objects.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 19, "comments": 10, "commits": 8, "created_at": "1630949041", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["alca-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "db-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "number": 35174, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 4, "state": "open", "title": "Added PPSAlignmentConfiguration - a new conditions format for PPS global alignment", "updated_at": "1631627190", "user": "MatiXOfficial"}

This code resides in a new package DataFormats/TCDS. It replaces the FED1024 class which exposes direct access to the underlying data structure, and incorporates the separate BSTRecord. I also changed the code using the old accessors to the new ones, as far as I could find them. In addition, the EventAuxiliary is now filled with the current fill (store) number instead of 'edm::EventAuxiliary::invalidStoreNumber'.\r\n\r\nThis PR corresponds to PR #20471, but targets the 9_2_X release cycle.", "branch": "CMSSW_9_2_X", "changed_files": 58, "closed_at": "1508912677", "comments": 41, "commits": 19, "created_at": "1505387084", "deletions": 551, "labels": ["alca-approved", "comparison-available", "core-approved", "daq-approved", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "hlt-approved", "l1-approved", "orp-pending", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_9_2_X", "number": 20513, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 4, "state": "closed", "title": "Persist TCDS FED payload - Version of 9_2_X", "updated_at": "1508912677", "user": "mommsen"}

The new modifier is also included in the `alpakaValidation` modifier chain.\r\n\r\nWith the introduction of the alpakaValidationLST modifier, the offline workflow testing LST on CPU vs. LST on GPU can be made explicit. The code is changed so that the heterogeneous workflow `0.712` (previously `0.704`) runs the offline reconstruction without any additional CPU reconstruction, while a new workflow, `0.713`, runs the comparison. Workflow `0.703` has also been renamed to `0.711`. The workflow numbering changes are made so that the offline LST workflows follow the numbering conventions for Alpaka workflows, following https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/49832#discussion_r2694322784.\r\n\r\nThe PR has been validated by running workflows `0.711`, `0.712` and `0.713` locally. They finished successfully, with the anticipated content in the DQM file.\r\n\r\nThis PR includes the offline part of #49832 and it supersedes it.

As a results of Hector\r\n       transport scattered protons moved to from IR to PPS station and Geant4 get these protons in front of PPS or ZDC. Actual       implementation of Hector transport is outside this PR, here only interface is provided\r\n   2) n, nbar, gamma with direction along beam pipe eta cut is not applied in order to allow them fly forward to ZDC\r\n   3) code format and printout format\r\nThese modifications are needed for PPS simulation. Due to change in very forward direction simulation histories are affected, so no regression is expected\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nprivate\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR: not now\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1598593683", "comments": 13, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1598557487", "deletions": 45, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "56ac1dcf7156c955a0054e36d4482d76af6da2ba", "merged_at": "1598593683", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 31270, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fixed generator/Geant4 interface for PPS ", "updated_at": "1598595735", "user": "civanch"}

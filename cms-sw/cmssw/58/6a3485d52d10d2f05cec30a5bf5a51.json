I took the opportunity to do a merge --squash.\r\n\r\nA cms.Sequence can be converted to a cms.Task as long as the objects it contains are modules. The cms.Task is then passed to a cms.Sequence of the same name as the original. Doing this conversion allows ConvertToUnscheduled to work more efficiently.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 73, "closed_at": "1511810592", "comments": 174, "commits": 22, "created_at": "1507639970", "deletions": 814, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fastsim-pending", "orp-approved", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "f493624b3018543865bbf04bb8a48c5dae44bc82", "merged_at": "1511810592", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_0_X", "number": 20879, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 24, "state": "closed", "title": "cms.Sequence->cms.Task conversion for reconstruction", "updated_at": "1511810592", "user": "gartung"}

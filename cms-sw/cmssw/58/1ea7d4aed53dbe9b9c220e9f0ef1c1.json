This PR removes the last mentions of the object \"HLTSchedule\".\r\n\r\nThe most important change is the removal of the internal renaming which was temporarily needed inside one of the customisations maintained by HLT.\r\n\r\nThe other changes are simply cleanup of `test/` configs that unnecessarily use the name \"HLTSchedule\" (these are cleanups I missed in #36073); please note that some of these configs are old, and already broken anyways for unrelated reasons; still, mentions to `HLTSchedule` are removed, in the interest of clarity.\r\n\r\nMerely technical. No changes expected.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nUnit-tests and `addOnTests` passed. Verified that the affected `test/` configs continue to work if they were working already.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nThis is a cleanup PR, not a bugfix, so no backport to `12_2_X` is planned (could be done if that's preferred).", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": "1639009724", "comments": 10, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1638892057", "deletions": 136, "labels": ["alca-approved", "dqm-approved", "hlt-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "f2605db510d4bae1e354d6f3098bde303e5ead90", "merged_at": "1639009724", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 36395, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "removal of last mentions of \"HLTSchedule\"", "updated_at": "1639009724", "user": "missirol"}

By probe side we mean that the muons of B should be excluded from the filter, while the filter must be passed by another muon of the event (eg B+->mu1mu2K, B- ->mu3X; we want only the mu3 to be filtered). This filter helps to save valuable events that were going to be wasted by using the \"standard\" filters.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nThis is a backport of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/26286 . There I have uploaded validation and performance plots. Also that PR passed all the tests.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\n\r\nThis PR is backport of #26286 \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1554230194", "comments": 13, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1553872040", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "generators-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "4c65ef342b1c1b302261d98ec5147b99781e1997", "merged_at": "1554230193", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 26300, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Pythia filter to focus on the probe side of B decays (backport)", "updated_at": "1554230194", "user": "gkaratha"}

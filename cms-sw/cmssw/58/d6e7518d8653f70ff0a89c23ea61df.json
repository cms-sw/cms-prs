This will be need to improve the performance for the ultra-legacy reprocessing.\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "changed_files": 11, "closed_at": "1628551767", "comments": 7, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1628514962", "deletions": 169, "labels": ["core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "backport-ok"], "merge_commit_sha": "80c020d161fcc7ae98511d3feec99cbad3ac3cc7", "merged_at": "1628551767", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 34822, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Better handling of timeout in FWCore/SharedMemory [10_6]", "updated_at": "1628551767", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

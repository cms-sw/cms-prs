The main use case is running HCAL method 2 for just HCAL hits which interest e/gamma. \r\n\r\nThe main motivation is to allow it to filter on QE11 HCAL digis for HEP17. At this time I also added in the ability for it to filter ECAL + ES digis incase the time to run multifit globally is to much. Finally I added EcalRecHit and EcalUncalibratedRecHit instances so it could can eventually replace HLTRecHitInAllL1RegionsProducer instances which is a very similar but not as flexable module which is now redundant. \r\n\r\nSome minor changes were needed to make the HLTCaloObjInRegionsProducer function with the new objects (front -> begin , wrapping id() in to a DetId as some return ints, some return DetIds). \r\n\r\nFinally I also added a function to EB and EE DigiCollections to allow a Digi to be directly pushed back to them like all other Digi collections I've encountered in CMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1493961769", "comments": 13, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1493734898", "deletions": 13, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "hlt-approved", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "a6ea5585ddedccd085135464774d6a313e907088", "merged_at": "1493961769", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_2_X", "number": 18544, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Adding new instances of HLTCaloObjInRegionsProducer for HLT filtering", "updated_at": "1493961769", "user": "Sam-Harper"}

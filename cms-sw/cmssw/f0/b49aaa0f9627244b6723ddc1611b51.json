The update involves modifications to certain thicknesses and a material. Following a series of email exchanges and the most recent Simulation Meeting on Friday, November 8, it was decided to include only the two modified XML files in this PR and wait for their integration into a new 2026 Scenario (see PR validation Point  number 1).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n1) In CMSSW_14_2_X_2024-11-03-0000, after editing the files\r\nGeometry/CMSCommonData/python/cmsExtendedGeometry2026D115XML_cfi.py and\r\nGeometry/CMSCommonData/data/dd4hep/cmsExtendedGeometry2026D115.xml\r\nto include the lines referencing the new mb4Shields.xml and materials.xml files, an overlap check was performed using:\r\n\r\ncmsRun SimG4Core/PrintGeomInfo/test/python/g4OverlapCheck2026DD4hep_cfg.py geometry=D115 tol=0.001 \r\n\r\nresults: no overlaps found.\r\n\r\ncmsExtendedGeometry2026D115XML_cfi.py and cmsExtendedGeometry2026D115.xml are not included in this PR to let @bsunanda @civanch to decide about a new 2026 Scenario.\r\n\r\n2) Geometry check performed using the ROOT script web_cms.cxx, which loads the cmsSimGeom-2026D115.root file generated with the command:\r\n\r\ncmsRun Fireworks/Geometry/python/dumpSimGeometry_cfg.py tag=2026 version=D115\r\n\r\nresult: all the MB4Shileds are in place (see attached picture)\r\n\r\n<img width=\"759\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-11-08 alle 17 56 12\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df27f0db-bf52-4fb6-a29b-cf4ab0430425\">\r\n\r\n3) runTheMatrix with w.f 32024.0\r\n\r\nresult: all the 5 steps successfully\r\n\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

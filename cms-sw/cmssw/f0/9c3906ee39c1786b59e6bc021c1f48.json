The ref is replaced by an `edm::Ptr` to the calorimeter primitive (different in barrel and endcap).\r\n- further cleanup of the `TkElectron` interface and of data members;\r\n- charge is now populated for all `TkElectrons`;\r\n- change charge definition for GT electrons in accordance with new convention;\r\n- use non-PV-based photon isolation in hardware objects; \r\n- eta and phi at vertex (from the track) are now used for the `TkElectron` coordinates.\r\n\r\n*NOTE*: backward compatibility is maintained via IO rule in the reflex dictionary.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nSuccessfully tested reading files produced with previous versions of the object data formats.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 15, "comments": 3, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1700234041", "deletions": 255, "labels": ["l1-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "number": 43317, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Phase-2 L1T: Consolidation of e/g object interface", "updated_at": "1700239507", "user": "cerminar"}

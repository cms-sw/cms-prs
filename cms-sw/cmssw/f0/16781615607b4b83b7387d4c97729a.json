It should be\r\n    deprecated in this version of the standard, freeing the reserved name up\r\n    for use in a future standard, much like auto has been re-used this time\r\n    around for being similarly useless.\r\n\r\nSee: http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4193.html#809\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: David Abdurachmanov <David.Abdurachmanov@cern.ch>", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1493987530", "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1493890760", "deletions": 12, "labels": ["alca-approved", "analysis-pending", "comparison-available", "db-pending", "geometry-approved", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "64386649e538b2bc00c9fb32ea80e9f896a9f62e", "merged_at": "1493987530", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_2_X", "number": 18566, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Remove deprecated (in C++11) 'register' keyword", "updated_at": "1493987530", "user": "davidlt"}

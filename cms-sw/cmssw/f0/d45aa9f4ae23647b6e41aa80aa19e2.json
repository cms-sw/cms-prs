On a signal MC sample, it's 2.6kB/event. The previous estimate of 8kB/event was made with low pileup events by chance. The reduction was achieved by  \r\n- reducing the precision to 10 mantissa bits for all floats by default  \r\n- for tracks and ditracks, the precision is reduced to 6 bits (0.5% std error)  \r\n- storing only ditracks that are part of the B-candidates\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n- ran a few tests on data and MC. Changes are minor, so it should be sufficient  \r\n- code-checks and code-format\r\n\r\n@gmelachr, @abragagn, @sarafiorendi, please check the precision and let me know if it's too low. We should be able to afford a few exceptions.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 13, "closed_at": "1746715484", "comments": 9, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1746699263", "deletions": 277, "labels": ["fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved", "xpog-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "341edfe4b80256c6606d4933bd786aa836530e65", "merged_at": "1746715484", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 48033, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "BPHNano size reduction", "updated_at": "1746715487", "user": "drkovalskyi"}

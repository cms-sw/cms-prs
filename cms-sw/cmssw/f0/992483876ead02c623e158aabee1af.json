The `rawIndex` sets high bits based on the cluster type on top of the `key` already for a somewhat similar purpose (disambiguation).\r\n\r\nNo changes are expected (confirmed in LST CI tests) with regular IT-only seed inputs.\r\n\r\n@VourMa ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 4, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1754045295", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "tracking"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 48659, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "LST: allow OT tracker hits on the input seeds", "updated_at": "1754045454", "user": "slava77"}

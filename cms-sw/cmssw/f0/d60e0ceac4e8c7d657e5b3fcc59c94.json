Since MTE is not read by default, the only sensible default value for MTE usage mode is `kNever`. Apparently I missed these in #3105, where the default value of RectangularEtaPhiTrackingRegion itself was set to `kNever`. In hits PR also the other TrackingRegionProducers having `kForSiStrips` default (those who do not read MTE by default) are changed to use `kNever` mode by default (PointSeededTrackingRegionsProducer seems to have appeared since #3105).\n\nIn all current uses (e.g. in HLT) where these TrackingRegionProducers are uset with the default MTE usage mode, only pixel hits are read (without MTE) and the bug is not triggered. The case in reported in the HN was probably the first use of any of these TrackingRegionProducers with strip hits (otherwise we should have got segfault report earlier).\n\nTested in 760pre2, no changes expected in results.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1441690563", "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1441470600", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["comparison-available", "hlt-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 11155, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Change default MeasurementTrackerEvent mode to kNever in several TrackingRegionProducers", "updated_at": "1441690563", "user": "makortel"}

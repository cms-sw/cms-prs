The update has already been included in the 102X series for the nanoAOD campaign but the change was never propagated to 10_6_X and master.\r\n\r\nSee the [HN thread](https://hypernews.cern.ch/HyperNews/CMS/get/calibrations/4357.html) for details.\r\n\r\nThis PR may or may not be final. I have requested clarification from QGL experts whether Run 3 MC should receive this update as well. However, since the Run 3 updates will not be backported to 10_6_X, the portion that will be backported to 10_6_X is final.\r\n\r\nThe GT diffs are as follows:\r\n\r\n**Run 1 proton-heavy ion**\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/112X_mcRun1_pA_v1/112X_mcRun1_pA_v2\r\n\r\n**2016 realistic pre-VFP era**\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/112X_mcRun2_asymptotic_preVFP_v1/112X_mcRun2_asymptotic_preVFP_v2\r\n\r\n**2016 realistic post-VFP era**\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/112X_mcRun2_asymptotic_v1/112X_mcRun2_asymptotic_v2\r\n\r\n**2016 cosmics (asymptotic conditions)**\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/112X_mcRun2cosmics_asymptotic_deco_v1/112X_mcRun2cosmics_asymptotic_deco_v2\r\n\r\n**Offline data**\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/112X_dataRun2_v6/112X_dataRun2_v7\r\n\r\n**Offline data (HEM failure)**\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/112X_dataRun2_HEfail_v6/112X_dataRun2_HEfail_v7\r\n\r\n**Offline data relval**\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/112X_dataRun2_relval_v6/112X_dataRun2_relval_v7\r\n\r\n**2018 realistic**\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/112X_upgrade2018_realistic_v5/112X_upgrade2018_realistic_v6\r\n\r\n**2018 realistic (HEM15/16 failure)**\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/112X_upgrade2018_realistic_HEfail_v5/112X_upgrade2018_realistic_HEfail_v6\r\n\r\n**2018 cosmics (tracker deco mode)**\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/112X_upgrade2018cosmics_realistic_deco_v5/112X_upgrade2018cosmics_realistic_deco_v6\r\n\r\n**2018 cosmics (tracker peak mode)**\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/112X_upgrade2018cosmics_realistic_peak_v5/112X_upgrade2018cosmics_realistic_peak_v6\r\n\r\nThere is an additional technical update in this PR to the Run 1 proton-HI GT to remove the obsolete record of type `PGeometricDetExtraRcd` that is no longer defined.

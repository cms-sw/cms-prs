This might lead to double deletion and consequent job crashes.\r\nIn this PR (commit d68381f) the behaviour is changed by releasing the ownership of the managed payload object to the `PoolDBOutputService` hence avoiding the double deletion.\r\nI profit of this PR to introduce (in commit aef5077) a new plugin `SiPhase2OuterTrackerLorentzAngleReader` to read `SiPhase2OuterTrackerLorentzAngle` payloads and use it in unit tests.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRun the augmented unit tests `scram b runtests`\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nN/A", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "comments": 9, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1634641212", "deletions": 19, "labels": ["alca-pending", "db-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "bug-fix", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "number": 35731, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "open", "title": "Fix pointers double deletions from `PoolDBOutputService` in `CondTools` subsystem ", "updated_at": "1634654303", "user": "mmusich"}

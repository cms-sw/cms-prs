I made a new task that produces these new inputs towers and produces the GCT objects with these towers. The additional towers are added to the event content.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested in [#1226 in cms-l1t-offline](https://github.com/cms-l1t-offline/cmssw/pull/1226). New objects are produced and consumed by GCT producer, and physics performance of GCT jets and taus are as expected. \r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

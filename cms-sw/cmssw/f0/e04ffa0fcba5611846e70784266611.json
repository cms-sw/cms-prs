This PR fixes the issues and will be able to read DeepMET from MiniAOD in the same way as chsMet, caloMet, etc. For the eras where DeepMET is computed in MiniAOD, it would be computed on the fly, inside the `nanoAOD_recalibrateMETs` function. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\ntested with runTheMatrix.py and passed all tests.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\nnot a backport.\r\n\r\nnotifying @steggema @mseidel42 and @mariadalfonso \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 8, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1632857517", "deletions": 26, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved", "xpog-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_2_X", "number": 35460, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "add back DeepMET in NanoAOD", "updated_at": "1637605719", "user": "yongbinfeng"}

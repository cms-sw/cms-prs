If the function\r\n> takes a `std::vector const&`, the inputs are forced to be allocated on\r\n> the heap. So if one wants to call functions with constant size or even\r\n> scalar input, that would cause a large overhead.\r\n> \r\n> This overhead can be avoided when generalizing with `std::span`.\r\n> \r\n> The standalone Minuit2 build files were also changed to consider the\r\n> `std::span` backport to C++17 that is already in ROOT.\r\n> \r\n\r\nThis PR updates classes that inherit from it.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nBot tests. \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": "1726221250", "comments": 29, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1725951364", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["alca-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "db-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved", "tracking"], "merge_commit_sha": "4e7c227bbf7169f031204fdf55e289bf1a259982", "merged_at": "1726221250", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_14_2_X", "number": 45965, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Update classes inheriting from ROOT::Minuit2::FCNBase to account for changes in ROOTmaster", "updated_at": "1726221251", "user": "iarspider"}

If the function\r\n> takes a `std::vector const&`, the inputs are forced to be allocated on\r\n> the heap. So if one wants to call functions with constant size or even\r\n> scalar input, that would cause a large overhead.\r\n> \r\n> This overhead can be avoided when generalizing with `std::span`.\r\n> \r\n> The standalone Minuit2 build files were also changed to consider the\r\n> `std::span` backport to C++17 that is already in ROOT.\r\n> \r\n\r\nThis PR updates classes that inherit from it. This change is probably not backwards-compatible.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nBot tests. \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 7, "comments": 12, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1725951364", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "alca-pending", "db-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "hold", "code-checks-approved", "tracking"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_2_X", "number": 45965, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[ROOTMaster] Update classes inheriting from ROOT::Minuit2::FCNBase to account for changes in ROOTmaster", "updated_at": "1726051129", "user": "iarspider"}

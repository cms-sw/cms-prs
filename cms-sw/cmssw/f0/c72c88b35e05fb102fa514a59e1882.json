That is not what was happening. Instead, pointer math was happening. So if idx was 1 the resulting string was ubfolder . If idx was 2 we got bfolder . If idx was larger than the string length we would get random garbage.\nThis problem was found by clang.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1398838845", "comments": 6, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1398777409", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "21c77af9040a6a8675ede54101141778f81041a0", "merged_at": "1398838845", "merged_by": "nclopezo", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_1_0_pre8", "number": 3574, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix append bug in DQMEventMessage", "updated_at": "1399391515", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

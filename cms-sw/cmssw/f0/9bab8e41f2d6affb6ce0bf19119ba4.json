Electronics specifications updated from HGCROCV2 to V3\r\n2 . Leakage of amplitude from BX-1 updated and made gain specific\r\n3 . fluence updated to latest maps from bril\r\n4 . logic to detect optimal HGCROCv3 gain slightly modified to favor the MIP peak in the [8-15] ADC range\r\n\r\nAll these changes won't affect the HGCAL DIGI in startup. \r\nThey all affect only DIGI the end-of-life configuration ( ``SLHCUpgradeSimulations/Configuration/aging.customise_aging_3000 ``).\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nWe've run workflow 23434 w/ and w/o customisation for ageing at 3000/fg. No significant changes in the startup. CPU time per event decreases in the 3000/fb scenario by a few seconds, driven by the reduction in hit occupancy\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 15, "closed_at": "1593435656", "comments": 35, "commits": 39, "created_at": "1593091170", "deletions": 213, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "499b2404183d598f028a1a49393cd6508b464c0e", "merged_at": "1593435656", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 30422, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 33, "state": "closed", "title": "HGCAL end of life DIGITISATION update", "updated_at": "1593435656", "user": "franzoni"}

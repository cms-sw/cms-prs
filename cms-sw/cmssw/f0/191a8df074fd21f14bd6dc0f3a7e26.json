The current algorithm discards _all_ duplicates.\r\n  - Include in the output the last pixel of each module. The current implementation ignores the last pixel of each module, and nobody seems to know why.\r\n\r\nImplement a few small optimisations:\r\n  - Adjust the number of nearest neighbours after duplicate removal.\r\n  - Remove an unnecessary synchronisation.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTechnical validation performed on top of CMSSW 15.0.10 running over 10k events from Run2025C.\r\nPhysics validation is required.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

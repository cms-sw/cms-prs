The current implementation ignores the last pixel of each module, and nobody seems to know why.\r\n\r\nImplement a few small optimisations:\r\n  - use only 64 groups, instead of one per module;\r\n  - adjust the number of nearest neighbours after duplicate removal;\r\n  - restrict the domain of atomic operations to per-block;\r\n  - remove an unnecessary synchronisation.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTechnical validation performed on top of CMSSW 15.0.10 running over 10k events from Run2025C.\r\nPhysics validation is required, though no changes are expected.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

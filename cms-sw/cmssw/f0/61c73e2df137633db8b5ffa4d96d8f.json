Using to container allows each thread to get its own temporary instance of the storage and returns it for later use when it is no longer needed.\r\n- extended the thread based unit test to also test that an object shared across threads operates properly.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles. All unit tests pass.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 83, "comments": 25, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1689958738", "deletions": 224, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "dqm-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "visualization-approved", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_3_X", "number": 42334, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "The cut parser is now const-thread-safe", "updated_at": "1690349701", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

Using to container allows each thread to get its own temporary instance of the storage and returns it for later use when it is no longer needed.\r\n- extended the thread based unit test to also test that an object shared across threads operates properly.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles. All unit tests pass.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 82, "comments": 8, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1689958738", "deletions": 218, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "dqm-pending", "analysis-pending", "visualization-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_3_X", "number": 42334, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "The cut parser is now const-thread-safe", "updated_at": "1690034227", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

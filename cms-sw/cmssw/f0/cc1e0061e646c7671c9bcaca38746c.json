The version of the input RelVal to be used is not the default one, but the override mechanism added for the upgrade version is not directly applicable to the standard relval workflows because they are added with a different syntax.\r\n\r\nHere the dataset stored in the desired element of the dictionary is extracted, modified according to the predefined input dictionary \"overrideFragment\", and the dictionary element is re-created with the new definition.\r\n\r\nVerified to solve the pending issue when running the command runTheMatrix.py -i all -t 4 -l 250204.18.

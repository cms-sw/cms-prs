The addition of the ETL scenario v10 (global scenario D119) was not properly accounted for in the acquisition of the input parameters to the ```MTDTopology```, and this causes the geometry navigation, performed during the tracking, to recursively call a method that allocates memory within \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/2bed69b1658e4deeaef914e462741919e9183be3/RecoMTD/DetLayers/src/MTDDetSector.cc#L69\r\n\r\nA similar problem happened during the development of #47353 . The comparison between enum class objects requires the ```static_cast<int>``` conversion to work properly, that was not correctly applied in ```MTDParametersFromDD```.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe update is clearly needed, it allows wf 33634.0 ~~to run smoothly in single threaded mode~~.\r\nRepeated checks show that the initial commit do not solve the issue, neither in single nor in multi-threaded mode.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1742592827", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["geometry-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 47660, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "MTD geometry: fix the topology parameters reading for ETL v10", "updated_at": "1742802245", "user": "fabiocos"}

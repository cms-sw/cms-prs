This PR can be rebased once you sign that PR!  \n\nHLT:  This adds new ESProducers for (presently unused) new Conditions, which will be needed by the updated uGT emulator which provides bitwise correct emulation of all correlation conditions.\n\nPlease pre-emptively update the HLT configs to provide the ES content as in:\n\n```\n   L1Trigger/L1TGlobal/python/GlobalParameters_cff.py\n```\n\nThis will have no effect currently, but having these conditions ready will mean that we can turn on the update to uGT with no change to HLT configs.  @fwyzard suggested this approach, which I believe is wise.\n\nNote that the Prescales/Vetos ES object will _not_ be requested by uGT emulator when those are not re-emulated... so you should never need such a dummy producer in HLT configs.  \n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 28, "closed_at": "1463552286", "comments": 13, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1461325736", "deletions": 16, "labels": ["alca-pending", "comparison-pending", "db-pending", "l1-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 14207, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Prepare HLT for New Conditions needed by update of uGT Emulation", "updated_at": "1463552286", "user": "mulhearn"}

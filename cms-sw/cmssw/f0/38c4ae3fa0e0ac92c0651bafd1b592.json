This PR adds data formats for Run 3 and Phase II trigger primitives in the endcaps, and creates a framework for these TPs to be processed by the EMTF emulator.  These changes will benefit various groups developing L1T muon for post-2020 running, including @dildick , @mmaggi , @camilocarrillo , @gabrielhpugliese , and others.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds no new functionalities on its own, and changes nothing about how the EMTF emulator runs.  It only provides foundational elements (data formats and TP processing framework) for following PRs, in which TP processing in EMTF will be actually enabled when running a \"future\" scenario.  @rekovic , @thomreis please take a look.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nAndrew\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 22, "comments": 20, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1522840161", "deletions": 118, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "l1-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 22839, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "open", "title": "EMTF April 2018 emulator update part 2 - GEM and Track Trigger data formats", "updated_at": "1523359384", "user": "abrinke1"}

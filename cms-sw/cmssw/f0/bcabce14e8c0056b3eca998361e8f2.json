The goal of the negative tagger is to have the same light jet distribution as the full tagger, but filter out as many b-jets as possible at high discriminator values. This is done by inverting the sign of all distributions that are symmetric under sign inversion for light jets, but not for b-jets.\r\n\r\nA description of the negative taggers in general can be found in these presentation at the BTV meeting [1] and at the RECO meeting [2].\r\n\r\nThe DeepFlavour negative tagger distribution is shown in [3]. The negative tagger discriminator values are shown from -1 to 0, and the full tagger is shown from 0 to 1. Red is b-jets, blue and light blue are light jets, and green is c-jets.\r\n\r\nOriginally this PR was a part of PR https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/23206 , but it was filtered out due to merge conflicts. The review comments by @slava77 left in that PR has been dealt with here.\r\n\r\nPR https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/23206 also introduced the 94X training which was made a while back. While that PR was ongoing we produced a 10X training, which performs better, so in this PR we also add a new DeepFlavour model trained on 10X MC samples. It is therefore required that the PR  https://github.com/cms-data/RecoBTag-Combined/pull/14  is merged first. The ROC curves can be seen in [4]. Here the dashed line is c vs b and the full line is l vs b.\r\n\r\n[1] https://indico.cern.ch/event/713923/contributions/2938152/attachments/1620844/2578707/NegativeTagger.pdf\r\n\r\n[2] https://indico.cern.ch/event/732060/contributions/3020340/attachments/1660464/2659922/NegativeTaggerPR.pdf\r\n\r\n[3]\r\n![deepflavournegativetagger](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33452471/40931381-2e97c132-682b-11e8-8e55-05e5e12bf78e.png)\r\n\r\n[4]\r\n![rocs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33452471/40931388-34d62d54-682b-11e8-8e80-cc4f9cf2ff49.png)\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 8, "comments": 3, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1528125376", "deletions": 30, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "code-checks-pending", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 23467, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "DeepFlavour Negative Tagger + DeepFlavour 10X training", "updated_at": "1528125980", "user": "emilbols"}

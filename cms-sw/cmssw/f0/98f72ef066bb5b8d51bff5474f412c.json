In the case of  BaseIsolator, the simplest is to atomize them, as done in this PR.\r\n\r\nThe counters here are used for printing of statistics of the ```test ``` method calls. I do not see a strong need for a correctness of this in a multithreaded environment.\r\nThe ```atomic``` is effectively to just silence the warning.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1556908927", "comments": 29, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1556721265", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "e9909fb8c887c875699af94357e39ce5f06537d5", "merged_at": "1556908927", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 26586, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "atomize counters in BaseIsolator.h", "updated_at": "1556964022", "user": "slava77"}

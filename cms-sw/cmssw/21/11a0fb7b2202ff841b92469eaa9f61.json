While checking the match between TPs from Data and emulation, we found that the current algorithm cannot handle the case in PFA2 when there is a saturation only in SOI while there is no saturation in SOI+1, which produces some TPs saturated in Data, but not saturated in the emulation. There are two plots showing this discrepancy: [ietaViphi](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17723379/164754027-584f1ca1-e7a1-46c1-9f98-4d273c9dab5a.png) and [et_corr13](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17723379/164754047-7213e4b1-b71c-4ce0-a0e7-23c5cd19b4f8.png). ietaViphi shows the TPs with a disagreement, and et_corr13 compares the data vs emulation for TPs with ieta=-8. We can see there are 2 TPs that are saturated in data but not in emulation. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nA basic technical test was performed: runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nThis PR is not a backport. \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1650951220", "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1650637170", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["l1-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "d40dbd864ef4429ba4c133dfcbacac0448ce07a7", "merged_at": "1650951220", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 37658, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "HCAL: HCAL TP bug fix for PFA2 scheme", "updated_at": "1650951220", "user": "TaeunKwon"}

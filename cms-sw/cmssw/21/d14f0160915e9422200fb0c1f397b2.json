This breaks many framework unit tests.\nThis workaround sets preprocessor variables recognized by boost that are used if and only if **ROOTCLING** is defined.  These preprocessor definitions cause the assembler code to not be included.  This fixes the unit test errors.\nThe final fix for this problem should be either that ROOT6 is fixed to handle assembler, OR that CMSSW replaces with std::shared_ptr those uses of boost::shared_ptr that cause problems \n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_ROOT6_X", "changed_files": 12, "closed_at": "1387259750", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1387246786", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["core-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "number": 1842, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Workaround for ROOT6 limitation", "updated_at": "1406911279", "user": "wmtan"}

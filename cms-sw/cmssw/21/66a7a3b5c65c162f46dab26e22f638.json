This pull request changes all of the `run2` era modifications to `run2_common` then removes the `run2` era.  Users should specify `Run2_25ns`, `Run2_50ns` or `Run2_HI` instead, all of which include any `run2_common` changes.\n\nThis touches a lot of packages but the changes are trivial.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 23, "closed_at": "1424696153", "comments": 10, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1424269407", "deletions": 39, "labels": ["alca-pending", "comparison-available", "dqm-pending", "fastsim-approved", "geometry-approved", "l1-pending", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "e7251ce4549adc5481ee4dd351ebf84c40be6c81", "merged_at": "1424696153", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 7841, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Move run2 era to run2_common", "updated_at": "1424783125", "user": "mark-grimes"}

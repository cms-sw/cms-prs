That efficiency drop was traced to [PR47160](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/47160) which includes changes in the RPC geometry for Run 4.\r\n\r\nWe have found one (unintentional) change in the modified RPC geometry (v4) used by [PR47160](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/47160) that we suspect is the cause. This is the reverse rotation direction on RE4 Ring2&3 (RTXURTXUR), which we believe could potentially cause a mismatch. Therefore, we propose to roll back the rotation direction to the same as in v3, while keeping the other changes.\r\n\r\nThis PR submits modified RPC Endcap geometry - 2030/v6/rpcf.xml\r\n- Based on the existing v4 definitions\r\n- Revert RE4 Ring2&3 chamber rotations (same as v3):\r\n- No other elements from v4 are changed (not a full rollback to v3)\r\n\r\nExpected impact:\r\n- With the modified geometry, we expect to restore L1 muon matching efficiency in Phase 2 Endcap without affecting any other detector geometry or reconstruction.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n- Geometry overlap checks: no new overlaps detected.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

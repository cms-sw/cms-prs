Possibly via the DQMGenericClient module (see muon harvesting). https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSLITDPG-579\r\n - Histogram title for efficiency plots should drop the word denominator.\r\n - Drop events y axis label for efficiency plots.\r\n - &phi; resolution plots should not show (phi-phi_offline)/phi_offline but phi-phi_offline only.\r\n - &eta; resolution plots should not show (eta-eta_offline)/eta_offline but eta-eta_offline only.\r\n - Review binning for 2D L1 vs. offline pT plots and normalise to the bin size.\r\n   - Can keep the binning for now but the bin content should be normalised to the bin area. With the normalisation \"(normalised to bin area)\" should be added to the histogram title.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note*: I have also included all MonitorElements in the initializer list to prevent segmentation faults.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 11, "comments": 19, "commits": 12, "created_at": "1528358430", "deletions": 193, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "dqm-pending", "l1-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-started"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 23515, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 7, "state": "open", "title": "[L1T][DQMOffline] Upgrading L1TEGammaOffline (CMSLITDPG-585)", "updated_at": "1528793511", "user": "kreczko"}

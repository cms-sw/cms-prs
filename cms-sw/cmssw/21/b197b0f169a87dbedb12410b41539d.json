We distinguish the (a) Lower-level objects, which are inputs to (b) Higher-level objects that are (can be) used in the L1T Menu.\r\n\r\n(a) Lower-level objects:\r\n\r\n * l1ParticleFlow_calo_Task\r\n    * pfClustersFromL1EGClusters ,\r\n    * pfClustersFromCombinedCaloHCal ,\r\n    * pfClustersFromCombinedCaloHF ,\r\n    * pfClustersFromHGC3DClusters\r\n\r\n\r\n * l1ParticleFlow_pf_barrel_Task\r\n    * pfTracksFromL1TracksBarrel ,\r\n    * l1pfProducerBarrel \r\n\r\n\r\n * l1ParticleFlow_pf_hgcal_Task\r\n    * pfTracksFromL1TracksHGCal ,\r\n    * l1pfProducerHGCal ,\r\n    * l1pfProducerHGCalNoTK\r\n\r\n\r\n * l1ParticleFlow_pf_hf_Task\r\n   * l1pfProducerHF\r\n\r\n * Candidates\r\n   * l1pfCandidates\r\n\r\n(b) Higher-level objects, that are (can be) used in the L1T Menu:\r\n\r\n* l1PFJetsTask\r\n   * ak4PFL1Calo\r\n   * ak4PFL1PF\r\n   * ak4PFL1Puppi ,\r\n   * ak4PFL1CaloCorrected\r\n   * ak4PFL1PFCorrected\r\n   * ak4PFL1PuppiCorrected\r\n\r\n\r\n*  l1PFMets Task\r\n   * l1PFMetCalo\r\n   * l1PFMetPF\r\n   * l1PFMetPuppi\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we use `phase2_trackerV14` modifier to enable in the sequence the phase2 L1T modules that depend on TrackTriggerTracks.   This solution effectively means that the central workflows earlier than era `Phase2C9` will not execute these modules (neither will TrackTrigger TrackFinderTrack module)\r\n\r\nThe reason for this is that the Hybrid TrackTriggerTrackFinder at the moment cannot run on geometries earlier that Tracker v14, and are enabled via the same modifier only in eras `Phase2C9` and later.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Still to do\r\n * Add PF Taus (currently missing from this PR)\r\n * Add Phase1 PF jets which should reside in L1Trigger.L1CaloTrigger package\r\n```\r\n# Phase1 PF jets\r\n# ########################################################################\r\nfrom L1Trigger.L1CaloTrigger.Phase1L1TJets_cff import *\r\n_phase2_siml1emulator.add(Phase1L1TJetsTask)\r\n``` \r\nHowever, in this ParticleFlow package we already have the jets `ak4PFL1PuppiCorrected` that could be used in principle.  Although these were not used in the Menu of the L1T TDR, the two have a vary similar performance. The plan is, if possible to include the Phase1 PFJets is time permits, to be fully consistent with the L1T TDR.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with a description of which tests have been performed to verify the correctness of the PR, including the eventual addition of new code for testing like unit tests, test configurations, additions or updates to the runTheMatrix test workflows -->\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 69, "closed_at": "1593759781", "comments": 69, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1593600537", "deletions": 22, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-notrun", "l1-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-rejected", "upgrade-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "8738603d20c0828c33637821ce509060c7283d24", "merged_at": "1593759781", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 30482, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 14, "state": "closed", "title": "New Package - Phase2 L1 ParticleFlow ", "updated_at": "1593759781", "user": "rekovic"}

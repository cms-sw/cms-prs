Also, the same checks were performed in the MinimumBias dataset produced for 1000 events. Please, see slides 1-9 from here [1].\r\n\r\nNo significant changes were observed in event and track variables while removing the No-Looper condition except for the Hit count distribution.\r\n\r\nAn issue had been raised already regarding disabling looper reconstruction for HeavyIons. Please look here [2] for detail.\r\n\r\nLink for the HI Trackin POG:\r\n[1] https://indico.cern.ch/event/1153062/contributions/4841907/attachments/2429416/4159748/NoLooper_HITracking.pdf\r\n\r\nLink for the issue:\r\n[2] https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/35758\r\n\r\nPR validation:\r\n\r\nRun time observations and a detailed study of each track variable have been performed with enabling and disabling trackingNoLoopers. We have also performed a detailed comparison of tracking efficiency, fake, multiple, and nonprimary reconstruction fractions for central, peripheral, and minimum bias events with enabling and disabling trackingNoLoopers.\r\n\r\nIf this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\ncc: @mandrenguyen, @abaty, @CesarBernardes", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 13, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1654689739", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["operations-pending", "reconstruction-approved", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "tracking"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 38288, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Disabled looper reconstruction in HI Eras for Run3_pp_on_PbPb and Run2", "updated_at": "1654843139", "user": "sayanchatterjee38"}

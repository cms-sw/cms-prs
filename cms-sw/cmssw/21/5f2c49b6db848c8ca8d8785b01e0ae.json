This change uncovered a loophole in logic allowing run to end prematurely if end of run file (written by BU) is in ramdisk, but there is still at least two empty lumisections and then some data to process.\nFix is to allow the run to be closed only if no new files/lumisections have been discovered by source after EoR file has already been written to the input directory.\n\nThis change was submitted in 74X as #11156 and in 75X as #11157\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1441947755", "comments": 6, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1441481905", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["comparison-available", "daq-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "49f4ff7abbb71d98da7a4c5e5d365dfaccb5280c", "merged_at": "1441947755", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 11158, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix premature end of run in DAQ (76X)", "updated_at": "1447408310", "user": "smorovic"}

I ignored all non-GEM commits and commits that were simply merges. I solved most conflicts manually. The resulting code compiles, but I have not been able to test it yet. Which workflow can I use to test it?\n\nEDIT: fixed various suggestions by Slava\nEDIT2: include the frame rotation fixes in SimG4CMS/Muon\nEDIT3: include ME0DigiPreReco dataformat from DataFormats/GEMDigi\nEDIT4: update the digitizers in SimMuon/GEMDigitizer\nEDIT5: update of the inclusion guards in various GEM and related header files\nEDIT6: Minor fixes following suggestions by @slava77 , @civanch and @ianna \n\nCheers,\nSven\n\n(*)\n\n<PRE>\ncommits=( $(git log --topo-order official-cmssw/CMSSW_6_2_X..official-cmssw/CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC --reverse --pretty=format:%h -- Geometry/GEMGeometry Geometry/GEMGeometryBuilder Geometry/GlobalTrackingGeometryBuilder Geometry/CommonDetUnit Geometry/Records DataFormats/MuonDetId Geometry/MuonNumbering CondTools/Geometry) )</PRE>\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_2_X", "changed_files": 182, "closed_at": "1410524982", "comments": 37, "commits": 190, "created_at": "1409356724", "deletions": 3040, "labels": ["comparison-available", "geometry-approved", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved", "visualization-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "9a93f839418b66141229dde9b523cf2073ca4273", "merged_at": "1410524982", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_2_X", "number": 5115, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 15, "state": "closed", "title": "Port GEM software from 62XSLHC to 72X", "updated_at": "1462025091", "user": "dildick"}

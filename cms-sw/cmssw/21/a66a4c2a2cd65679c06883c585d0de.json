It provides the same utilities as SoA, i.e., `View`, `ConstView`, and `Metadata`, in a more minimal form, making `AoSWrapper` a suitable object for `PortableCollection`s to wrap. The `transpose()` function enables heterogeneous conversion between SoA and AoS in both directions and runs via a kernel with a fixed thread count, prioritizing ease of use.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTwo test cases have been added, one testing the correctness of the new AoS Layout (`AoSUnitTests.cc`) and one testing the heterogeneous transposition between AoS/SoA and SoA/AoS (`test_catch2_portableAoS.dev.cc`).\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 11, "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1759758123", "deletions": 15, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending", "heterogeneous-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_0_X", "number": 49072, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Added AoSWrapper and transposition function", "updated_at": "1759758148", "user": "leobeltra"}

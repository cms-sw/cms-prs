However, this PR provides a superficial clean up by providing P2 aliases for the most commonly used functions and enums. \r\n\r\nThis PR targets CMSSW 16.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis doesn't remove any of the original enums or functions, so shouldn't break anything. I've checked that the P2 L1 tracking algorithm can successfully run if a few small changes are made to it to switch to the new P2 function names and enums. (We'll make this change at some point in the future, once this PR is merged).\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1762160364", "comments": 16, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1761603615", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved", "tracking", "trk"], "merge_commit_sha": "48c20415a9caf71f0dd2cc3beb0647e9c0855122", "merged_at": "1762160364", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_16_0_X", "number": 49228, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add function and enum aliases for P2 tracker topology with more obvious names", "updated_at": "1762160365", "user": "tomalin"}

A previous PR was closed for us to test things before reopening, this is the same MEMuon functionality, now tested.\n\nMost comments from the previous PR have been incorporated/addressed, moving the location of a few modules and some other changes as well.  One comment regarding a dummy plane hasn't been implemented, we plan to send a PR for ME0 chambers in full reco soon as well.  Naturally there might be further comments.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 33, "closed_at": "1444220351", "comments": 59, "commits": 46, "created_at": "1442842141", "deletions": 71, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-rejected"], "merge_commit_sha": "3382ea58f53d6d46131887eddef770c43444839b", "merged_at": "1444220351", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 11398, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 33, "state": "closed", "title": "Me0 muons in 76 x commitv2", "updated_at": "1444340289", "user": "dnash86"}

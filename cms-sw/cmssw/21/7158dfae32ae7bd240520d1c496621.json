Only `c_str()` is guaranteed to return null-terminated string, but writing to the character array accessed through `c_str()` is undefined behavior.\r\n* Replaced call to `getcwd` with C++17 filesystem API\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nBot tests", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1719482124", "deletions": 11, "labels": ["core-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 45327, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Update RemoteFile::local", "updated_at": "1719482719", "user": "iarspider"}

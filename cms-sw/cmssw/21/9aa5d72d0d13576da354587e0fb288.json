This change was motivated by the discussion at [1].  The definition of 'saturated' we use here is the same as what is used in the SubClusterShapeFilter, i.e. a cluster having 3 consecutive strips of ADC>=254.  Note that this flag is not currently used in the reconstruction sequence; this PR is simply to ensure this information is not dropped in the new approx. cluster data format.  This is expected to increase the approximate cluster collection size by ~1% and barely affect the timing performance [2].\r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/38423#issuecomment-1168993837\r\n[2] https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/pub/Main/HIDetectorReadout2020/SaturatedStrips.pdf\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nThis PR was tested by running workflow 140.58 step 2, and checking the approximated cluster collection in the output.  \r\n\r\n@mandrenguyen @icali \r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1659695592", "comments": 13, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1658918055", "deletions": 8, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "eb2d3a59a3aa2a722da88f97059810aa841d35c1", "merged_at": "1659695592", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 38870, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "Addition of saturated flag in SiStrip Approximate Clusters", "updated_at": "1659695592", "user": "abaty"}

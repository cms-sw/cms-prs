As reported in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/37512, after python2 to python3 migration this script does not work any more in slc6 env ( due to missing python3). The change here proposed to use the `python` used by `cmsRun` . This is the same trick we did for few other shared python tools (https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw-wm-tools/tree/master/bin).\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/37512", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 4, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1649497309", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["generators-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 37514, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Update cmsLHEtoEOSManager.py to use python used by cmsRun", "updated_at": "1649510775", "user": "smuzaffar"}

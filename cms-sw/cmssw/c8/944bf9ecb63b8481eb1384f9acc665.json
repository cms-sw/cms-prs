Previously, the negative fluctuation are recovered by equalization. This pull request switches to a postive energy-only clustering, where the negative fluctuation are propagated through the clustering as ghost particles, and then resummed.\n\nThe expected performance difference is a deterioration of 0.5 GeV/c or 1% energy scale difference for 50 GeV jets in the 2.76 TeV PbPb system, due to the effect of ECAL zero suppression on the underlying event  - which is not handled in this implementation, as opposed to the previous equalization method.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1432225697", "comments": 20, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1431358304", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "0c4e74bca3be61ad38449047de62d17401154876", "merged_at": "1432225697", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 9039, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Switch Voronoi subtraction from equalization based recovery of negative fluctuation to ghost-particle based clustering and energy resumming", "updated_at": "1432225697", "user": "yslai"}

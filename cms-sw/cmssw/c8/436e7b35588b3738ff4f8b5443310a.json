The 3-bit Run-3 pattern number and 4-bit slope (as calculated from the 12-bit comparator code and one of 5 patterns) are assigned in the `pattern_ ` member. In addition, the Run-2 pattern number will be stored in `pattern_ `. For Run-3 scenarios, this Run-2 pattern is but an approximation. The idea is to continue sending LCTs with Run-2 patterns to the EMTF/OMTF to facilitate integration and training/testing of new algorithms for prompt and displaced muons. LCTs in real data will not contain the approximate Run-2 pattern number. In due time, the simulation should also only send the actual Run-3 pattern number.\r\n- The `CSCLCTTools` file was replaced by class `LCTQualityControl` to check for valid stubs\r\n- Preliminary LCT quality definitions were added for Run-3 CSC-only stubs and Run-3 GEM-CSC stubs\r\n- The redundant variables `dynamic_state_machine_zone` and `useOldLCTDataFormat_` have been removed. The former parameter was made redundant in #25165. The latter is superseded by `use_run3_patterns_`\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested in CMSSW_11_2_X_2020-08-06-1100 on `/RelValSingleMuFlatPt2To100/CMSSW_11_0_0-PU25ns_110X_mcRun4_realistic_v3_2026D49PU200-v1/GEN-SIM-DIGI-RAW` and in CMSSW_11_2_0_pre3 on `/RelValSingleMuPt10/CMSSW_11_0_0-110X_mcRun4_realistic_v2_2026D49noPU-v1/GEN-SIM-DIGI-RAW`\r\n\r\nResults shown here: https://indico.cern.ch/event/947218/contributions/3980597/attachments/2089339/3510511/CSCPositionResolutionNewPatterns_SD_20200819.pdf\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nFYI @tahuang1991 ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 29, "closed_at": "1598397857", "comments": 97, "commits": 9, "created_at": "1596762641", "deletions": 710, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "4c9009832707cd0f5af5c7086189dcdf561f678a", "merged_at": "1598397857", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 31086, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "CCLUT quality control and preliminary quality definition for GEM-CSC stubs (CCLUT-6)", "updated_at": "1598397858", "user": "dildick"}

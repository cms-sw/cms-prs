This is added here.\r\nIn addition I profit to fix the `fillDescriptions`  method of [PtMinTrackCountFilter.cc](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/compare/master...mmusich:PtMinTrackCountFilter?expand=1#diff-d632b65943b2e5288d54a8e4c534126f0c96dc867790e617e87fa48cdf50eac7) which has been introduced in PR https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/29604/ (this is done in commit: a3e107893bcd74b54f27b62e549c9365c479deac, without it, using the filter results in failure validating the configuration).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nPrivate, tested adding:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom CommonTools.RecoAlgos.ptMaxTrackCountFilter_cfi import ptMaxTrackCountFilter\r\nprocess.myfilter = ptMaxTrackCountFilter.clone(src = cms.InputTag('ctfWithMaterialTracksP5'),\r\n                                               ptMax = cms.double(3.))\r\n```\r\n\r\nto configuration file and tested it works correctly.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nN/A", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 12, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1649350895", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 37500, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "open", "title": "Introduce `PtMaxTrackCountFilter`", "updated_at": "1649996302", "user": "mmusich"}

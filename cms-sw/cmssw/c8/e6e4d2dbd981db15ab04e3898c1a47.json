A few changes to the NanoGen configs are also made to fix small issues and to simplify the setup.\r\n\r\nOnly one validation workflow is added currently, starting with a GEN step. In principle a step with MiniAOD input would also be relevant.\r\n\r\nAs discussed previously, the inputs should be modified based on if the input event content is MiniAOD-like or GEN-like. In the cmsDriver implementation, this is just decided by seeing if the GEN step is run in the cmsDriver command. If a GEN file is input and only one step is run, it expects Mini. Maybe there is a better way to detect this, but for now I just called the customize command for GEN input explicitly.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI checked that ./runTheMatrix.py -l 595 runs and gives sensible output. The DQM workflow also runs, but I didn't actually check that the plots are produced correctly. Is there an easy tool to see all the plots it creates?", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 10, "closed_at": "1603194696", "comments": 69, "commits": 8, "created_at": "1601121875", "deletions": 40, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "generators-approved", "orp-approved", "pdmv-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved", "urgent", "xpog-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "bd566165290abe1b3241779445761f81ff154cf6", "merged_at": "1603194696", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 31591, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Nano gen dqm", "updated_at": "1603194697", "user": "kdlong"}

Recently, the regional em factors were introduced (PR #29165), since the previous thickness correction factors applied only in the calibration of RecHits corresponding to Silicon sensor cells from the results we got with the CE_E region of the detector, while for Scintillator only dEdx weights were applied. However, thickness correction factors are also used in the CLUE algorithm to define the noise threshold.\r\n\r\n2. The scintillator factor wasnt correctly applied.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nYou can find in [1] a thorough validation of the PR. \r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nI don't know the procedure for backporting a PR, but we would like to backport this is 11_1_X. \r\n\r\n[1] https://indico.cern.ch/event/965023/contributions/4063982/attachments/2123036/3573722/Regionalemfactors_noisecorrections_14Oct20.pdf\r\n\r\n@rovere @cseez @felicepantaleo @lecriste @pfs @franzoni @mariadalfonso \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1602892268", "comments": 45, "commits": 12, "created_at": "1602246819", "deletions": 13, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "fe2df407f64199a6633a2f092b93b2cd4a261b77", "merged_at": "1602892268", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 31730, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 4, "state": "closed", "title": "[HGCAL] CLUE and regional factors", "updated_at": "1602892269", "user": "apsallid"}

In this way, we ensure that payload will be readable by (presumably) all releases. The assigned IOV is kept as the second-last, to minimize the amount of update involved in the test.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1630902633", "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1630389507", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["db-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 35084, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Changed algorithm for o2o test copy", "updated_at": "1630902634", "user": "ggovi"}

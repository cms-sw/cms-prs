The existing class `Histogram1D` is now made to derive from `Histogram1` along with `Histogram1DD` which addressed the issue above, via class templates.\r\nI profit of this PR to add protections to `Histogram1` and `Histogram2D` in order to yield framework warnings in case the provided binning does not make sense, and also few miscellaneous graphical adjustments to some of the existing plots. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRelies on existing unit tests.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nNot a backport, no backport needed.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1607539699", "comments": 9, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1607353605", "deletions": 29, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "db-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "53b3a60481e2b077ba37203b3c92ba6fa10d24af", "merged_at": "1607539699", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 32404, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Strip payload inspector: add class to retrieve list of dead modules from JSON", "updated_at": "1607539699", "user": "mmusich"}

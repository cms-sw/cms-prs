Totally technical.\nIn RecoEgamma/EgammaTools/plugins, there are free function templates in different files that have the same signature. These are violations of the ODR (one definition rule).\nThe reason this problem has not yet been seen before is that the function templates in question are declared \"inline\". However, \"inline\" is only a suggestion to the compiler. When compiled in debug mode (-O0), in-lining was apparently turned off. This did not cause a link error, as function templates are not instantiated until run time. However, it caused the wrong function to be called in several cases, causing relvals 4.53, 135.4, and 1330.0 to fail.\nThe fix is to put the templates inside an anonymous namespace, so each template is not seen outside the compilation unit. This fixes the failing relvals.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1441344082", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1441160247", "deletions": 44, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "6735a2f0bf3a510d976348bf5293895cbd780740", "merged_at": "1441344082", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 11069, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Use anonymous namespace to avoid duplicate symbols", "updated_at": "1442242414", "user": "wmtan"}

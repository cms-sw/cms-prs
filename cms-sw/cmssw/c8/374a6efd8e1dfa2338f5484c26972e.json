Backporting should be straightforward. However before backporting some additions to what done here are foreseen. \nUpdate PhotonAnalyzer: add pf isolation histos and sigmaE/E switch off 90% of the scatterplots when running centrally, update photonAnalyzer and photonOfflineClient sequences so that they are cloned and used for ged and std photons. Update ZToMuMuGammaAnalyzer for ged quantities and particle based isolation. Update the squence as well so it is closed and used for ged and for std photons (for comparison until we kill them). Then the sequence for std photons can be removed. \n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "changed_files": 13, "closed_at": "1393918132", "comments": 14, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1393348261", "deletions": 1244, "labels": ["dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "01e8c91bf4180703d13ef0f749ee6947e3532628", "merged_at": "1393918132", "merged_by": "nclopezo", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_1_0_pre5", "number": 2636, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 4, "state": "closed", "title": "Egm ged dqm offline updates for7 xx 1", "updated_at": "1394439751", "user": "nancymarinelli"}

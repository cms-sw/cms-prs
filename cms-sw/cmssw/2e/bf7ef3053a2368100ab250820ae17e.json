This PR adds GEM segments to the count of segments in MuonIdProducer, so that inner detector tracks which match to only an ME0 segment will pass the isGoodTrackerMuon and be saved into the reco muon collection.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with a description of the feature proposed or problem addressed, specifying:\r\n  - what changes are expected in the output if any, \r\n  - what other PRs or externals it depends upon if any,\r\n  - link to any additional material useful to provide a documentation for this PR (slides, JIRA tickets, related pull requestes, hypernews, TWiki or Indico pages)  -->\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRan the phase-2 workflow 24811.0_TenMuExtendedE_0_200+2026D98 and checked before and after the changes that muons at high eta (|eta| > 2.4) which had a me0 segment match were not being saved before the changes, and are now being saved to the reco muon collection after the changes.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with a description of which tests have been performed to verify the correctness of the PR, including the eventual addition of new code for testing like unit tests, test configurations, additions or updates to the runTheMatrix test workflows -->\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

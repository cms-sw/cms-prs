The intention of this PR is to update them to match the 2024 HLT Menu v1.4 and introduce all the muon related paths. Moreover, the second table was wrong since the id was larger than `Int16` format and, then, no object was stored. This is also fixed and the `id` is modified from 131313 to 1331.\r\n\r\nThis PR only affects the trigger bits stored in the custom MUO@POG nanoAOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nP.d: Comments are added to help future developments and analyzers.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 1, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1737361297", "deletions": 30, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending", "xpog-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_0_X", "number": 47139, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Fix trigger table for MUO@POG flavored nanoAOD ", "updated_at": "1737361356", "user": "BlancoFS"}

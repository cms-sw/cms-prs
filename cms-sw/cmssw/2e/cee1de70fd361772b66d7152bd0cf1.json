That's why this isn't\nworking with Clang and ICC in general.\n\nIt's a bit of gray area here. GCC most likely will lower  `std::log` to\n`__builtin_log_*` intrinsic which are not covered by C++14 standard.\nThus it's `__builtin_log_*` which is `constexpr`, thus making it work\nunder C++14.\n\nSigned-off-by: David Abdurachmanov David.Abdurachmanov@cern.ch\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1457599332", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1457515701", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "1f6e3d777881527249f4fdde8309f058697d90fb", "merged_at": "1457599332", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 13658, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Do not use constexpr with std::log in C++14 for ICC", "updated_at": "1457599332", "user": "davidlt"}

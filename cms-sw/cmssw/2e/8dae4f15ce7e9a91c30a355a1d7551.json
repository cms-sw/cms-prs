The wrong hit assignment to the track is avoided introducing an annealing factor which changes iteration by iteration.\nThanks to these features, DAF is particularly suited for noisy environments, where the electronic noise or pile up e\u001bffects can not be neglected.\n\nThe basic components are:\n- SiTrackerMultiRecHit: This is a TackingRecHit with virtual position and virtual covariance matrix built in order to incorporate several competing hits.\n- MultiRecHitCollector: which build the SiTrackerMultiRecHit collecting hits with the same IdDet (Simple one).\n- SiTrackerMultiRecHitUpdator: which builds the SiTrackerMultiRecHit or updates an existing one.\n- MRHChi2MeasurementEstimator: it performs the chi2 estimate.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_2_X", "changed_files": 56, "closed_at": "1404321587", "comments": 47, "commits": 17, "created_at": "1402477750", "deletions": 191, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "4b23ac433d1148ea0cc5bbfb3f721fd2461af44c", "merged_at": "1404321587", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_2_X", "number": 4205, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 19, "state": "closed", "title": "Deterministic Annealing Filter for track reconstruction", "updated_at": "1404321588", "user": "ebrondol"}

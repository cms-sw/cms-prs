This is a bug.\r\n\r\nThis fix simply restricts loading of the EventContent_cff in the Merge.py only in merging context for NANO AOD purposes.\r\n\r\nTests:\r\n``` python $CMSSW_BASE/src/Configuration/DataProcessing/test/RunMerge.py  --input-files file:a.root --output-file file:b.root --mergeNANO```\r\nand then config dump to see that the result is as expected. The RunMerge is also made aware of mergeNANO.\r\n\r\n```python $CMSSW_BASE/src/Configuration/DataProcessing/test/RunPromptReco.py --scenario ppEra_Run2_2017_pp_on_XeXe --reco --aod --miniaod --dqmio --global-tag 92X_dataRun2_Express_v7 --lfn=file:raw.root```\r\nand then dump to see that _hiCentrality name  actually shows up in the keep statements\r\n\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_9_4_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1523537773", "comments": 10, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1523511740", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["backport-ok", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "operations-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "4f7f2b1b05f08e60dcb22e7fbabee2acced98174", "merged_at": "1523537773", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_4_X", "number": 22940, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "decouple EventContent_cff load from general purpose use of Merge.py", "updated_at": "1523537779", "user": "slava77"}

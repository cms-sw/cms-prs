This allows for a consistent impact on simulated digis before packing and trigger-primitive generation.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTo be applied, DT aging a customization function should be used, no effect is expected in standard workflows.\r\n\r\nLocal testing was performed by adding the customization function in the step2 of `runTheMatrix.py -w upgrade 12809.0` and analyzing the produced samples.Results will be presented at the [Simulation meeting](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1477739/#63-aging-of-phase2-muon-detect)", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1732011389", "deletions": 9, "labels": ["simulation-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_0_X", "number": 46732, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[Simulation] Allow DT ageing toy model to run at the DIGI-L1T step", "updated_at": "1732446491", "user": "battibass"}

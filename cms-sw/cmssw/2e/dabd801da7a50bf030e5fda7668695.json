The validation code was referencing GEM super chambers even if they didn't exist, thus causing the crash.\r\n\r\nThis bug fix adds protection in the validation code to make sure that null or empty objects are not dereferenced.\r\n\r\nThe issue of the missing GEM super chambers requires further investigation. This PR is just a first step that allows reco to run to completion without crashing. The next step is to examine the plots derived from reco to try to understand what is missing from the GEMs.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe 11634.0_TTbar_14TeV+TTbar_14TeV_TuneCP5_2021 reco step was tested using XML geometry and a second time with DB geometry, and it ran successfully.\r\n\r\nNo backport is needed.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": "1588747677", "comments": 15, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1588685391", "deletions": 142, "labels": ["bug-fix", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "1e787ddbade736ccd94ee25bc13e3af9dffad6e1", "merged_at": "1588747677", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 29741, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix crashing bug  in reco when run with XML geometry", "updated_at": "1588747678", "user": "cvuosalo"}

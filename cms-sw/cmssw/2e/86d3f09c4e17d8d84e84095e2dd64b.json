The shared resources are global\nvariables the module uses. This ensures thread safety\nin the case where multiple BeamHaloProducers are run\nin the same job (practically speaking this probably\nnever happens).\n\nMore importantly, the static code analyzer reported a\nthread safety problem. A future version of the static\nanalyzer will not report the problem if\nBeamHaloProducer is a one module with a shared resource.\nSo this should eliminate the warning.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_3_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1417117341", "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1415993863", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["comparison-available", "generators-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_3_X", "number": 6414, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Thread safety improvement BeamHaloProducer", "updated_at": "1423062868", "user": "wddgit"}

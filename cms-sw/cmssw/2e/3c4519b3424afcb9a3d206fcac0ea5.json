This change adds two new signals to the ActivityRegistry for this purpose: preModuleEventDelayedGetSignal_ and postModuleEventDelayedGetSignal_. At the moment we only need signals for Event requests since they are the only ones which can be delayed. Also, delayed file reads caused by objects like edm::Ref do not trigger this signal because the requisite ModuleCallingContext is not available from that call since the call directly accesses the edm::EventPrincipal and not the edm::Event.\nThanks go to Andrea Bocci for noticing the need for these signals.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1382954414", "comments": 6, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1382708262", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-rejected"], "merge_commit_sha": "844b93d57d026bc76edf5f18fb04d9ce2a0fad4f", "merged_at": "1382954414", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_0_0_pre8", "number": 1185, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Added new Service signals to watch for a delayed get from the Event.", "updated_at": "1382954414", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

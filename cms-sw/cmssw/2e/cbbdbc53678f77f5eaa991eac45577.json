This is because reduceMantissaToNbitsRounding doesn't actually accept -1 as an argument, in other places where this is used, the call to reduceMantissaToNbinsRounding is bypassed: https://github.com/kdlong/cmssw/blob/ece4581e13b78bc0f0fb87c93296bcbe90c79500/DataFormats/NanoAOD/interface/FlatTable.h#L28\r\n\r\nI'm not aware of this showing up in the normal nano production, but we use it in the Wmass customisation here [1], and have only realised that the pt precision, which should be -1 => full precision, is actually set incorrectly to quite low precision (not 100% sure how it is treated).\r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/kdlong/cmssw/blob/ece4581e13b78bc0f0fb87c93296bcbe90c79500/PhysicsTools/NanoAOD/python/nano_cff.py#L206", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1671181007", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending", "xpog-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "number": 40343, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Fix -1 precision in SimpleFlatTableProducer", "updated_at": "1671181458", "user": "kdlong"}

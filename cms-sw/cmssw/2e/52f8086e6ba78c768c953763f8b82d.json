Therefore, wf 42021.0 was modified and used for the validation. [The result](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1199653/contributions/5044332/attachments/2507440/4308901/GEM-DPG_220913.pdf) was presented in the GEM DPG meeting.\r\n\r\nAlso, because this PR touches `DQM/GEM`, this PR was valiated with the online DQM unit test.

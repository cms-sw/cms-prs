The change was discussed and agreed in May 9 TRK POG meeting\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/527844/contributions/2161117/attachments/1269921/1881271/slides_phase1_20160509.pdf\n\nThe main point is to exercise regularly the pixel seed extension code from #14356. For 2017 production we may revert this and go back to \"quadruplets by triplet propagation\" also in initialStep.\n\nPlease find below MultiTrackValidator plots with 1000 TTbar+PU35 events showing the effect of this PR on top of 8_1_0_pre5+#14545 (strip alignment as in `run2_asymptotic` GT)\nhttps://mkortela.web.cern.ch/mkortela/tracking/validation/CMSSW_8_1_0_pre5_pse/\n\nTested in CMSSW_8_1_X_2016-05-24-1100, non-2017 workflows should have no effect. 2017 workflows should have small effect on the level of generalTracks (mainly decrease of duplicate rate), while initialStep and highPtTripletStep have larger changes (mainly migration from highPtTripletStep to initialStep).\n\n@rovere @VinInn \n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1464276928", "comments": 12, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1464097088", "deletions": 28, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "fc7031e6ee394b9524671c2867a20602db6112e7", "merged_at": "1464276928", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 14621, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Use pixel seed extension for phase1 in initialStep", "updated_at": "1464276929", "user": "makortel"}

Basically the PR adds new `ObjectSelector(Stream)Producer` templates similar to current `ObjectSelector(Stream)` but being EDProducers (I'm not sure if the legacy-default is still \"needed\", I decided to include it only to have similar code structure as `ObjectSelector(Stream)`).\n\nAs a use case I added RecoTrackViewRefSelector (existing RecoTrack(Ref)Selectors take `vector<Track>` as an input, and I'll soon need anyway a version reading the input via `View`), and switched the tracking MC validation sequence to use it.\n\nTested in CMSSW_7_6_X_2015-06-24-2300, no changes expected in results.\n\n@rovere @VinInn \n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 11, "closed_at": "1435848797", "comments": 21, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1435295680", "deletions": 25, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "69f98876cacc2ddc2e333e22183eb3804a3d5e35", "merged_at": "1435848797", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 9904, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 4, "state": "closed", "title": "Add ObjectSelectorStreamProducer template and use it for RecoTrackViewRefSelector", "updated_at": "1476956386", "user": "makortel"}

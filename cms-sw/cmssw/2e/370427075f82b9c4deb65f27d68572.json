This PR implements the latter solution.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCMSSW compiles.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nNo backport intended.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 8, "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1634834894", "deletions": 11, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "number": 35774, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Rename `.icc` files in CommonTools/Statistics to `.h` files", "updated_at": "1634835313", "user": "guitargeek"}

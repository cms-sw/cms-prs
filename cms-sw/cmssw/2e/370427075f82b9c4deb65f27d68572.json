This PR implements the latter solution.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCMSSW compiles.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nNo backport intended.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 8, "closed_at": "1634949376", "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1634834894", "deletions": 11, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "58b6b2b1bef9c73fd60823363d587511cebf4be3", "merged_at": "1634949375", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "number": 35774, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Rename `.icc` files in CommonTools/Statistics to `.h` files", "updated_at": "1634949376", "user": "guitargeek"}

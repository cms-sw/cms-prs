This testing is done in situ, running the actual emulator in CMSSW by overwriting the inputs of an otherwise valid event to provide CICADA outputs (A warning about this behavior is issued when activated). This behavior is, of course, disabled by default. Messages are provided at the Info level.\r\n\r\nThis behavior should never be used in typical CMSSW operation, this is intended for CICADA team validation of the genuine emulator in as close to real scenarios as possible to ensure that it is functioning as intended.\r\n\r\n### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis PR has been tested on 3 zero bias events, and it successfully runs CICADA on provided patterns. This pattern testing has been used to catch a firmware/emulator mismatch (another correcting PR is open for that). The test patterns used for validation in this test have been provided as `CICADATestPatterns.py`\r\n\r\n### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

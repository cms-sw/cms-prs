This is generally applied in order to discard bad data, but it has been noticed several times in Run 3 (especially during cosmics data-taking) that the DCS information in the FEDRawData (obtained offline via `onlineMetaDataDigis`) is not 100% reliable. \r\nMoreover there has been at least one occurrence (for run [368343](https://cmsoms.cern.ch/cms/runs/lumisection?cms_run=368343&cms_run_sequence=GLOBAL-RUN)) in which a DCS issue which caused the TEC- DCS bit to be false till LS 990 of run 368343 (~9 am [elog](http://cmsonline.cern.ch/cms-elog/1185134)). As a consequence, the LS in the range [1-990] were discarded by the offline Strip and Tracking DQM (see [this presentation](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1271488/contributions/5445588/attachments/2663515/4614878/debuggingStripClient.pdf)) for more details.\r\nThis impedes the correct certification of that run. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI have run a modified `141.032`  workflow using this customization function (as in https://github.com/mmusich/cmssw/commit/80e792e11ce53320b9840ef499f0070a2e129974) in order to use LS=484 of run 368343, starting from the data in `/ExpressPhysics/Run2023C-Express-v4/FEVT` and obtained filled Strip and Tracking Plots (which are otherwise empty).\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

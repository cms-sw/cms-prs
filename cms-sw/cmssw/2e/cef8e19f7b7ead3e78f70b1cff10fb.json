These branches are:\r\n\r\n- genjet_pt\r\n- genjet_eta\r\n- genjet_phi\r\n- genjet_invisible_energy\r\n- genjet_auxiliary_energy\r\n- sim_genjet_idx\r\n\r\nThe last one is an index that allows each sim track to be matched with the jet it is closest to (minimizes R). This replaces the post-processing described in #48674 , which added branches corresponding to R and the jets after trackingNtuple.root was produced. The branches sim_genjet_deltaR, sim_genjet_deltaEta, and sim_genjet_deltaPhi are now also included in trackingNtuple.root.\r\n\r\nThis allows the efficiency, fake rate, and duplicate rate to plotted against R. I also included a limit such that only tracks corresponding to GenJets with pT > 1000 GeV are considered.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"488\" height=\"385\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45cb3bed-5aa3-4239-ad74-13f95487d8f2\" />\r\n\r\nNone of these changes should impact the rest of LST. The code looking at the jet branches can be enabled/disabled using the -J flag.\r\n\r\nHere are some example plots for 100 events from the file /RelValQCD_Pt_1800_2400_14/CMSSW_16_0_0_pre1-150X_mcRun4_realistic_v1_STD_RegeneratedGS_Run4D110_noPU-v1/GEN-SIM-DIGI-RAW, including only tracks with GenJet pT > 1000 GeV:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"522\" height=\"354\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cad5f160-a13e-44e9-af91-df9e145d7438\" />\r\n<img width=\"522\" height=\"354\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1a96e4b-df8f-4447-8976-540ee508c4c5\" />\r\n<img width=\"522\" height=\"354\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a7a44ede-eebc-4ef8-9446-84926ed12194\" />\r\n<img width=\"522\" height=\"354\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08e4ef0e-bb34-4128-92cc-7e98bf9a207b\" />\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 8, "comments": 6, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1770091381", "deletions": 200, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "tracking"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_1_X", "number": 50005, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 7, "state": "open", "title": "LST: Adding GenJets to LST with indexing", "updated_at": "1770143106", "user": "kk428"}

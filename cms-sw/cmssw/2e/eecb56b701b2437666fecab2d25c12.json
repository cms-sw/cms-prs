The arguments should be the addresses of the begin and end iterators.\nHowever, the ROOT6 specific conditions code was passing in the values of the iterators, rather than the addresses of the iterators.\nThis pull request fixes this problem, avoiding segfaults in several unit tests in CondCore packages.  Four of the fixed tests actually now will pass, but most will fail later due to other problems.\nPlease merge this pull request as soon as convenient.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_3_ROOT6_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1416864860", "comments": 0, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1416864680", "deletions": 4, "labels": [], "merge_commit_sha": "6c4c151c891d25864877dd04c72c4cbdb27361fa", "merged_at": "1416864860", "merged_by": "davidlt", "number": 6578, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Pass address of iterators", "updated_at": "1416920071", "user": "wmtan"}

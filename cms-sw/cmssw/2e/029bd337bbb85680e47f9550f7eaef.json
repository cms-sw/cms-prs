Plots attached are for the memory size of the produced collections, which is retained until the OutputModule.  These are using HGCal at 200 pileup.  The first blue line, `pixelPairStepSeeds` is noticeably reduced at this scale.  I tried the same on SeedCombiner (`newCombinedSeeds`, green line) but it has an accurate reserve so makes no difference.\nI haven't touched PFRecHitProducer (`particleFlowRecHitHGCEE`, the biggest offender) because I think @lgray has been working on that and has managed to make a significant memory saving.\n\nMemory consumed by just the collections put in the event, before this PR:\n![beforeshrink](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6480160/7640839/942a1960-fa7d-11e4-8897-1ae1e20c86fb.png)\n\nAfter:\n![aftershrink](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6480160/7640842/974f281a-fa7d-11e4-8b8e-02bae283a554.png)\n\nLooking at the VmSize there doesn't seem to be much of a change, but the memory saved is pretty small on this scale.  Every little helps though - or possibly the memory allocator is doing something fancy and not releasing the memory.\n![vmsize](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6480160/7640844/9a3587d6-fa7d-11e4-9129-fca060b65e42.png)\n", "branch": "CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1431959906", "comments": 6, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1431628249", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "e4a5c4b4f01bc327d534cdb44558becddbce5bb2", "merged_at": "1431959906", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "number": 9096, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Use shrink_to_fit on tracker seed collections", "updated_at": "1431959932", "user": "mark-grimes"}

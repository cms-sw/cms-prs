My script did not catch these before.\r\n\r\nReview comment https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/30535#discussion_r453792044 from previous PR has been addressed.\r\n\r\nAs always, only the dependencies which are **not included in any of the plugin sources** are removed, so these changes are orthogonal and complementary to the recent PRs which added all packages that are actually included in the **libraries**.\r\n\r\n**Edit:** In the second commit, some additional includes cleanup in RecoEgamma was done.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCMSSW compiles. It was checked that all newly added dependencies are actually required by the package with `git grep`.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 55, "closed_at": "1595341730", "comments": 32, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1594725614", "deletions": 189, "labels": ["alca-approved", "analysis-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "generators-approved", "geometry-approved", "l1-pending", "orp-approved", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "21190fba3f7061b0f6552ed9550cfd7bc585ba48", "merged_at": "1595341730", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 30679, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "Clean BuildFiles in and after Reco area", "updated_at": "1595341730", "user": "guitargeek"}

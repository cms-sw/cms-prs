Information is added to the Raw data (FRD format) header, where version is shrunk to use 16-bits and other 16 bits reused for flags (2 used initially).  Version is bumped to v6 of the format.\r\n\r\nRaw Output Module, which is used for conversions of offline datasets to FRD, betect data/MC flag in the event stores it in raw output (FRD version needs to be set to 6 or higher in that case). Check for the ancient FRD v1 has also now been removed. Compatibility with current real FRD data (v5 generated by the DAQ) is fully preserved.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested write + read chain with the generated data (fake BU); with the patch it is possible to generate new format, but also old one. Both modes have been tested. With v6 being default generated format, functional check is now part of the \"RunBUFU\" unit test.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 10, "closed_at": "1601418935", "comments": 35, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1600796468", "deletions": 37, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "core-approved", "daq-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "e3c172319af175e2b50d6289d47980cdd0f12b43", "merged_at": "1601418935", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 31543, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 27, "state": "closed", "title": "DAQ: added 16bit event info (flags) to FRD format", "updated_at": "1601418935", "user": "smorovic"}

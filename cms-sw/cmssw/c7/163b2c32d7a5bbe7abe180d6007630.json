It still includes generalized DQM compare modules for pixel rechits, tracks and vertices, which are templated if needed for other SoA types, an HLT customize function to include the module changes and pixel digi errors monitoring (that is also included in the DQM step), and the changes requested in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/43964#discussion_r1491530401.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nExecuted the code with wf `12834.403` to check DQM plots and everything works as expected.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

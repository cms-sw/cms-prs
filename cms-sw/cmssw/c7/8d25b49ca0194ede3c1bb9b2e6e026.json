The code uses the `XercesDOMParser`, and (without knowing much of Xerces) I'd imagine it to throw `DOMException` exception. I still kept the `SAXException` handler for completeness (e.g. if anyone in the future adds additional SAX parser or changes the DOM parser to SAX parser).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1685710165", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["alca-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_2_X", "number": 41852, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Convert also DOMException to cms::Exception in TotemDAQMappingESSourceXML", "updated_at": "1685727733", "user": "makortel"}

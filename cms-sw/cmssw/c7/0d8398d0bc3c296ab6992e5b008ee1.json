Moreover, the new cabling is optimized to balance the occupancy in the HPTDCs to not saturate the read-out fifos.\r\nThe cabling will not change anymore during 2018.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1521650790", "comments": 36, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1519924631", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "db-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "e2baf1adb22d02439476ac16bf9bcae60c5007bb", "merged_at": "1521650790", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_1_X", "number": 22404, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "PPS Timing Detector: Updated mapping for 2018", "updated_at": "1521650790", "user": "nminafra"}

Moreover, the new cabling is optimized to balance the occupancy in the HPTDCs to not saturate the read-out fifos.\r\nThe cabling will not change anymore during 2018.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 3, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1519924631", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["alca-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "db-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_1_X", "number": 22404, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "PPS Timing Detector: Updated mapping for 2018", "updated_at": "1519924798", "user": "nminafra"}

Moreover, the new cabling is optimized to balance the occupancy in the HPTDCs to not saturate the read-out fifos.\r\nThe cabling will not change anymore during 2018.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 0, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1519924631", "deletions": 1, "labels": [], "number": 22404, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "PPS Timing Detector: Updated mapping for 2018", "updated_at": "1519924647", "user": "nminafra"}

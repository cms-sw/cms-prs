It is caused by using a dangling reference to\nan edm::EventID object to determine the run number. At least with the gcc\nversions in SLC6, this results in an incorrect determination of the current\nIOV. Details are given in this presentation at the tracker-alignment meeting:\n\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/342234/session/0/contribution/8/0/material/slides/0.pdf\n\nThe commit is a quick fix to ensure a working alingment fit. There might be\na more involved follow-up to avoid similar bugs in the future.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_3_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1417452835", "comments": 14, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1416505053", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["alca-pending", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_3_X", "number": 6515, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "Important BUG FIX in parameter assignment of millepede-based tracker ali...", "updated_at": "1417452835", "user": "mschrode"}

The logic inferring the track MVA selector names missed a check that the MVA selector is part of the iteration sequence. This omission lead errors for tracking eras without MVA selection (`trackingLowPU`, `trackingPhase1PU70`, `trackingPhase2PU140`) in trackingOnly workflows. The check is added here.\r\n\r\nTested in CMSSW_8_1_X_2016-11-15-2300, no changes expected in non-trackingOnly workflows, or in trackingOnly workflows with run2 or `trackingPhase1` tracking.\r\n\r\n@rovere @VinInn ", "branch": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1479971422", "comments": 21, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1479310032", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["bug-fix", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "63a8566838779ed77238833f7b334da3f8de78c1", "merged_at": "1479971422", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "number": 16660, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix MultiTrackValidator MVA monitoring", "updated_at": "1479971422", "user": "makortel"}

I have fixed a few of these before, but they keep cropping up.  So,this pull request is a comprehensive fix for these issues, once and for all.  It adds a new member function to TypeWithDict that will return \"long long\" as the name, rather than \"Long64_t\", and changes the conditions code to use this new function \nNote:  because of the new member function, this request causes 829 packages to rebuild.\nThe only header change is a new function declaration.  No existing interfaces were changed.\nPlease merge this promptly, so I won't have to keep rebuilding 829 packages.\nNote: With this fix, the 102 tests still fail, but later for a different reason.  The next failure is a segfault,\nbut this request should still be merged.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_ROOT6_X", "changed_files": 22, "closed_at": "1394352040", "comments": 1, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1394297544", "deletions": 93, "labels": ["core-pending", "db-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "a4beb7616a7eca00f0367e732f37974d3967f87b", "merged_at": "1394352040", "merged_by": "ktf", "number": 2779, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix long64 issues in ROOT 6 Conditions code", "updated_at": "1394370215", "user": "wmtan"}

This pull requests solves the issue by doing the merge by hand. For the record the command I used was:\n\n```\ngit clone -b CMSSW_7_2_X https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw\ngit merge origin/CMSSW_7_1_X\n<fix empty space issue>\ngit commit -a\ngit push https://github.com/ktf/cmssw HEAD:forward-port-71X\n```\n\nand then I create a pull request. Merging this should also automatically merge #4136.\n\nFYI: @slava77, @davidlange6\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_2_X", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": "1402466855", "comments": 7, "commits": 11, "created_at": "1402140603", "deletions": 70, "labels": ["alca-approved", "comparison-pending", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "7e2b6f6176e9ef0642a5fcb072f19b00299055b3", "merged_at": "1402466855", "merged_by": "nclopezo", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_2_0_pre1", "number": 4158, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Forward port CMSSW_7_1_X into CMSSW_7_2_X (corrected by hand)", "updated_at": "1402684410", "user": "ktf"}

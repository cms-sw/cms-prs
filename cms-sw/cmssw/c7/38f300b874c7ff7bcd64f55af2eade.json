Of course this also includes addition of consumes interface to CSCRecHitD. I have not added consumes interface to two programs in test, CSCSegmentReader and CSCSegment Visualise because these obvioulsy haven't been used in a while and would need more updating than just the consumes interface to run. Not only that I find the config files to run them were deleted from cvs almost 5 years ago. I added a new config to test which runs a 100 event dump of CSC rechits and segments based on a relval raw data sample in 700pre3.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1378806529", "comments": 5, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1378724391", "deletions": 16, "labels": ["fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "8d34e0f18e558fc59f25fb4433a749ab2e18136a", "merged_at": "1378806529", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_0_0_pre4", "number": 743, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Consumes to CSCSegment", "updated_at": "1378885034", "user": "ptcox"}

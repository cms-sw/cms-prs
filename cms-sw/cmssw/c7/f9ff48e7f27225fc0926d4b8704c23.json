Nor may it\nbe desirable for the workflow layers to enable lazy-download for\nall merges (as some sites don't have the disk space).\n\nThis patch allows us to selectively turn on lazy-download only for\nmerge jobs at a given site by editing site-local-config.xml.\n\nSee also #5943.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_3_X", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": "1414162098", "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1414146206", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "6e60473339d6b6e8ebc7d120141110ccc8b72e37", "merged_at": "1414162098", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_3_X", "number": 5983, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Provide the ability to do a separate cache-hint for cloning.", "updated_at": "1414164229", "user": "bbockelm"}

This pull request adds the missing include to each of these files.  It also removes any remaining CVS tokens (e.g. $Id) in these files only.\nTested with checkdeps -a and the relvals.\nNote, two of the affected files are header files, but cout is used explicitly in both headers, so the include is needed for the header to compile.\nPlease include this trivial technical fix in CMSSW_7_0_0_pre7, bypassing signatures if necessary to make pre7.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 28, "closed_at": "1382468487", "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1382467506", "deletions": 10, "labels": ["alca-pending", "l1-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "3fde7abf0b79610272daa5064647914ed793d25b", "merged_at": "1382468487", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_0_0_pre7", "number": 1143, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "add missing include of iostream", "updated_at": "1382468487", "user": "wmtan"}

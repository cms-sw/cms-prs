This was giving problems downstream when the 16-bit \"infinity\" was widened to 32 bits and became inaccurate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis is so deep in the software stack that it is challenging to predict the behavior without ALL of the validations being run. \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1569004548", "comments": 35, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1568375899", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "b891f9921ca2846751b28a839e14ec022fe20060", "merged_at": "1569004548", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27988, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Truncate pt of PackedCandidate", "updated_at": "1569218738", "user": "rappoccio"}

The major changes are as follows:\r\n\r\n1) Added a filter on the tracks input to offlinePrimaryVertices\r\n2) Improved the timing of the ConversionStep by giving it an empty tracking region collection instead of a point-like tracking region\r\n3) Various tweaks to the tracking region parameters in most tracking iterations\r\n4) Scaling the size of tracking regions as a function of detector occupancy for the mixed/tobtec/pixelless steps (similar strategy to PR #21930)\r\n\r\nThe difference in tracking efficiency is fairly small, and the high-pt fake rate also goes down as can be seen by comparing the red lines in slide 6 in this presentation [1].  The reconstruction also runs about 15% faster, from slide 4.\r\n\r\n[1] https://indico.cern.ch/event/734653/contributions/3029929/attachments/1662113/2663273/Dener_Tracking_June1.pdf\r\n\r\n@mandrenguyen ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 14, "closed_at": "1531120165", "comments": 62, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1528290686", "deletions": 79, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "0aecd712001d7da763e34944ca39e6d0e7a7fab7", "merged_at": "1531120165", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 23510, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 10, "state": "closed", "title": "Modifications to tracking in pp_on_AA_2018 era to improve timing", "updated_at": "1531120165", "user": "abaty"}

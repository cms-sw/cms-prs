There is an occupancy directory with denominators and numerators. There should be an efficiency directory with plots as well, but clearly it's not there. This PR fixes that. \r\n\r\n<img width=\"975\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-09-02 at 12 49 09 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4134786/131901558-33e313dc-88ba-4933-867d-5addf5f4136d.png\">\r\n\r\nDenominators and numerators\r\n\r\n<img width=\"990\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-09-02 at 12 51 46 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4134786/131901671-73f488ea-43fb-49f2-bd5e-67ecc1a0b863.png\">\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with a description of which tests have been performed to verify the correctness of the PR, including the eventual addition of new code for testing like unit tests, test configurations, additions or updates to the runTheMatrix test workflows -->\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with any link to  -->\r\n\r\nBefore submitting your pull requests, make sure you followed this checklist:\r\n- verify that the PR is really intended for the chosen branch\r\n- verify that changes follow [CMS Naming, Coding, And Style Rules](http://cms-sw.github.io/cms_coding_rules.html)\r\n- verify that the PR passes the basic test procedure suggested in the [CMSSW PR instructions](https://cms-sw.github.io/PRWorkflow.html)\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1630839619", "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1630602493", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["dqm-approved", "simulation-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "d4bc4ea57b9986d8c06e94a9fbd663c8ae1e9650", "merged_at": "1630839619", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "number": 35135, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add CSC TP efficiency producer in standard DQM sequence", "updated_at": "1630839620", "user": "dildick"}

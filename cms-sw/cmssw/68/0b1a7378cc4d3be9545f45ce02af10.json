The `sigmaZ` value is still set to the \"original\" value of 5.3 cm, while 2015B data indicate that it is actually shrunk to ~4.3 cm: it is pending discussion with LHC OP.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1438147370", "comments": 6, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1438108806", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["comparison-available", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "3fb8d16e205d2c2c5740dda4640ca9ec5646854f", "merged_at": "1438147370", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 10435, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add vertex smearing parameters as measured during Run2015A (0T) and Run2015B (3.8T)", "updated_at": "1438147370", "user": "diguida"}

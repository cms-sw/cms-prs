A boolean configuration option is added to specify if the pT sum should be a scalar or vector sum. The default behavior is preserved via `fillDescriptions`. The purpose for this addition is primarily motivated by a need to filter POWHEG ttbb 4f samples during generation in a way that works uniformly across every decay channel.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis PR was validated by adding the filter during a GEN step when reading from an LHE, and worked as expected. Since the original functionality should be preserved as default, I do not expect any issues to arise for workflows which may already make use of this filter.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nThis PR should be backported to CMSSW_10_6_X for use in generating Run 2 UL samples.\r\n\r\n@hatakeyamak \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1749067486", "deletions": 14, "labels": ["generators-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 48250, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Add switch for scalar sum to LHEPtFilter", "updated_at": "1750264360", "user": "jsamudio"}

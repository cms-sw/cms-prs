This doesn't hurt, since the HI event content is a superset of the pp one. However, the implementation should be cleaned up.\n\nA backport to 80X will also be made.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1470332354", "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1468325593", "deletions": 24, "labels": ["comparison-available", "generators-pending", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "c74854b53d84f87104bcd6bf2f488e80ed6605ce", "merged_at": "1470332354", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 15175, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Point to 50ns vtx smearing for boosted pPb and clean up", "updated_at": "1470332355", "user": "mandrenguyen"}

However, code for recording the CUDA event was missing, so the other streams would find the default- constructed event, which is always \"valid\".\r\n\r\nAdding the missing call to record the event fixes the problem.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nSee #34725 .\r\n\r\n#### PR status:\r\n\r\nBackport of #34725 to `CMSSW_12_0_X`.", "branch": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1628056632", "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1627913258", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["backport-ok", "bug-fix", "fully-signed", "heterogeneous-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-rejected"], "merge_commit_sha": "21605fc3be08fc7514dd558fde883cf3690c805c", "merged_at": "1628056632", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "number": 34730, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix uploading EventSetup conditions from multiple CUDA streams [12.0.x]", "updated_at": "1628056633", "user": "fwyzard"}

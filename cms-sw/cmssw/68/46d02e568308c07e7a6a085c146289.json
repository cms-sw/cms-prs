It is supposed to check if the geometry has a complete ring, however in the case of demo chambers only two sectors are added and the ring is not filled, so that the check fails.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nBasic tests performed successfully starting from CMSSW_12_3_0_pre4. \r\nFrom CMSSW_12_3_0_pre4/src:\r\n> scram b distclean \r\n> git cms-checkdeps -a -A\r\n> scram b -j 8\r\n> scram b runtests\r\n> scram build code-checks\r\n> scram build code-format\r\n> runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1643281333", "comments": 20, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1643149682", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["l1-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "urgent", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "bd7c302c521452925e7e46b9004cd8ca5791d1ee", "merged_at": "1643281333", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 36803, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix of a check on the geometry in the RPCConeBuilder", "updated_at": "1643281333", "user": "elfontan"}

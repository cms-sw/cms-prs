It is supposed to check if the geometry has a complete ring, however in the case of demo chambers only two sectors are added and the ring is not filled, so that the check fails.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nBasic tests performed successfully starting from CMSSW_12_3_0_pre4. \r\nFrom CMSSW_12_3_0_pre4/src:\r\n> scram b distclean \r\n> git cms-checkdeps -a -A\r\n> scram b -j 8\r\n> scram b runtests\r\n> scram build code-checks\r\n> scram build code-format\r\n> runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 6, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1643149682", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["l1-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 36803, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Temporary fix of the RPCConeBuilder", "updated_at": "1643198309", "user": "elfontan"}

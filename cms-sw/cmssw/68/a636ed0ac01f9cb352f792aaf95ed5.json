To achieve this, we disable the ROOT auto-flush mechanism and explicitly optimize / flush from the NanoAOD output module itself.\r\n\r\nThis is the master equivalent of #22445.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1521081356", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "tests-started"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_1_X", "number": 22624, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Optimize NanoAOD buffers at 1k events.", "updated_at": "1521116119", "user": "bbockelm"}

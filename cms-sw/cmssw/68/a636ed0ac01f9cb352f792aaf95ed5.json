To achieve this, we disable the ROOT auto-flush mechanism and explicitly optimize / flush from the NanoAOD output module itself.\r\n\r\nThis is the master equivalent of #22445.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1521276574", "comments": 17, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1521081356", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "e1a84f0544d1545923a647030da481445fe28352", "merged_at": "1521276574", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_1_X", "number": 22624, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Optimize NanoAOD buffers at 1k events.", "updated_at": "1521276574", "user": "bbockelm"}

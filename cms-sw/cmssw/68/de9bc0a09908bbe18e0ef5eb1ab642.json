This PR removes unnecessary inheritances and does some further cleanup allowed by the removal.\n\nEssentially, the inheritance from HitPairGenerator is removed from\n- HitPairGeneratorFromLayerPair\n- CombinedHitQuadrupletGeneratorForPhotonConversion\n- HitQuadrupletGeneratorFromLayerPairForPhotonConversion\n- CosmicHitPairGenerator\n- CosmicHitPairGeneratorFromLayerPair,\n\nthe inheritance from HitTripletGenerator from\n- HitTripletGeneratorFromPairAndLayers\n- CosmicHitTripletGenerator\n- CosmicHitTripletGeneratorFromLayerTriplet,\n\nand the inheritance from MultiHitGenerator from\n- MultiHitGeneratorFromPairAndLayers.\n\n(Most of the developments were actually done already more than a year ago, but for some reason I didn't push them for integration and they got buried under other stuff)\n\nTested in 750pre5, no changes expected in results.\n\n@rovere @VinInn \n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 39, "closed_at": "1436170303", "comments": 14, "commits": 10, "created_at": "1435832017", "deletions": 439, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "1db83a1c6f03c3865fc6e3fcffe539796f03869a", "merged_at": "1436170303", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 10016, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "Simplify class stucture of hit generators", "updated_at": "1476956441", "user": "makortel"}

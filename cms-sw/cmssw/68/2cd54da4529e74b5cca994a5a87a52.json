But since I already had committed them, I though it would still be worth of the effort to ask the question: do we have any foreseen use case in `SeedComparitor`s for either the removed methods, or for TrackingRegion? ~~(hence \"RFC\")~~ Apparently not.\n\nPersonally I would eventually revamp the whole `SeedComparitor` infrastructure as its internals are currently very confusing (and there are implementations only for pixel/strip cluster shape cuts, but with total of 4 of them...).\n\nWhat do people think? Seems to be acceptable.\n\nTested in CMSSW_8_1_0_pre12, no changes expected anywhere.\n\n@rovere @VinInn @felicepantaleo \n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 18, "closed_at": "1475409017", "comments": 10, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1475141549", "deletions": 98, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "ea174e1d22a1e4fb50e81b0ceff24b1d55e66149", "merged_at": "1475409017", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 16031, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Remove unused functionality from SeedComparitor", "updated_at": "1475409017", "user": "makortel"}

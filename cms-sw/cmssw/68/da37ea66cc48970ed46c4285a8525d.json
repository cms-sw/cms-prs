The filter is:\r\n\r\n`hltDiEle*CaloIdLMWPMS2UnseededFilter`\r\n\r\nIt is the last filter of the unseeded leg of `HLT_DoubleEle*_CaloIdL_MW`, which are used by several analysis. Such an addition is supposed to make it possible for analyzers to calculate data/MC scale factors for these triggers using nanoAOD.\r\n\r\nIn order to make this possible, a couple changes had to be made at the level of the trigger object selection:\r\n\r\n- added the collection `hltEgammaCandidatesUnseeded`, which are the objects on which the selection of the unseeded trigger leg is made;\r\n- allowed `*PixelMatchUnseededFilter`, in OR with `*PixelMatchFilter`.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1686210391", "comments": 16, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1685535640", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved", "xpog-approved", "egamma"], "merge_commit_sha": "b4fcf8686c7705e1123b299b5efaf11ad904ff69", "merged_at": "1686210391", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_13_2_X", "number": 41827, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add CaloIdL_MW unseeded filter to nanoAOD filterBits", "updated_at": "1686210392", "user": "RSalvatico"}

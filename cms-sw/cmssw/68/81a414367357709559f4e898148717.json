This can be seen by running wf 301 and scanning thru the PVs with FWLite as follows:\r\nEvents->Scan(\"recoVertexs_hiSelectedVertex__RECO.obj.position_.fCoordinates.fZ\")\r\nWith this PR you will see distinct z-vertex values. \r\n\r\n@mdhildreth :  Can you have a look?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1502422812", "comments": 13, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1501681103", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "340d62a0dfcab92b8d81f90d720d20f493abd3dd", "merged_at": "1502422811", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_3_X", "number": 20024, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix mixing workflows that use playback", "updated_at": "1502422812", "user": "mandrenguyen"}

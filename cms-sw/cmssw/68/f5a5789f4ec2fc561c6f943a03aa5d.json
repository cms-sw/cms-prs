(This required some minor re-engineering of SonicTriton modules to ensure that clients are destroyed before the server is shut down; otherwise, there could be an exception or segfault from the client trying to unregister shared memory from a nonexistent server.)\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRan unit tests repeatedly, including with artificially-short server startup wait times (1s or 10s), to see that server log is printed as expected in the different cases above.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 7, "comments": 2, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1652204723", "deletions": 29, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "heterogeneous-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 37896, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Print fallback server log in TritonService", "updated_at": "1652205108", "user": "kpedro88"}

(This required some minor re-engineering of SonicTriton modules to ensure that clients are destroyed before the server is shut down; otherwise, there could be an exception or segfault from the client trying to unregister shared memory from a nonexistent server.)\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRan unit tests repeatedly, including with artificially-short server startup wait times (1s or 10s), to see that server log is printed as expected in the different cases above.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": "1652224355", "comments": 7, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1652204723", "deletions": 29, "labels": ["fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved", "heterogeneous-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "50201f24bb4f88998d94c223fb3d78b933209f35", "merged_at": "1652224355", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 37896, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Print fallback server log in TritonService", "updated_at": "1652224355", "user": "kpedro88"}

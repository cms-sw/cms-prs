This is addressed at 8e49f10451877c56f6cf1def481603198b840914 by introducing a new common sequence `seqALCARECOTkAlRelCombIsoMuons` that ulimately takes in input a `reco::MuonCollection` (with label `muons`) and returns a skimmed `reco::MuonCollection` called `TkAlRelCombIsoMuonSelector` which is then used to feed the rest of the selection chain.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrunTheMatrix.py -l 1001.0,1001.2,1001.3,1001.4,1002.4\r\n```\r\nruns. \r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

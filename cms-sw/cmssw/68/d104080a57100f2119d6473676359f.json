They are intended to be used on 2016 data. This new photon MVA uses CITK-based isolation calculation that caused several minor changes in EGM sequences that go outside of the new IDs themselves. This PR contains extra adjustments for using Tasks recently introduced in the framework rather than Sequences, although all old Sequences are kept as well for backward compatibility.\r\n  This PR is re-submission of the PR 18348 (and a yet ealier 18013).

The main interface\nchange is to require a StreamID or LuminosityBlockIndex\nargument to the getEngine function. In most cases,\nthis required moving code from the constructor to\nthe event or beginLuminosityBlock method. Then a pointer\nto the engine was percolated or passed in some way\nto the point where it was used.\n\nNote OscarProducer was migrated earlier and there are a\nfew pieces of code I skipped over that will be migrated\nin the near future. This pull request takes care of most\nof the digitizers and the mixing modules.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "changed_files": 177, "closed_at": "1392488810", "comments": 14, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1392069021", "deletions": 2128, "labels": ["core-approved", "dqm-approved", "fastsim-approved", "fully-signed", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "d467f072e04bc046edf03d577513723324fd3889", "merged_at": "1392488810", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_1_0_pre5", "number": 2392, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Migrate Sim Code to New Random Service Interface", "updated_at": "1396880351", "user": "wddgit"}

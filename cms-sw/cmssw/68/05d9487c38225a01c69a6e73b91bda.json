In addition, it is useful to view these events in a wider time window than the default configuration. This PR changes the timing windows and removes a chi-square constraint to make DQM more useful during splash events. This also adds an option `options.BeamSplashRun` to the ecal dqm client config to activate splash run mode in DQM, following the comment https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/35734#issuecomment-946966467 \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nValidated by the standard Ecal DQM configuration by manually setting `options.BeamSplashRun` to True and False and comparing the output plots. Results look as expected.\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1634736930", "deletions": 13, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "backport"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "number": 35747, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Changes to accommodate Splash events in ECAL DQM [CMSSW_12_0_X]", "updated_at": "1634770281", "user": "abhih1"}

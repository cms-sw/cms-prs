However, after rebasing, I cannot complete the runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all because of the same problems with #19205, namely some PhaseII sequence breaking the workflow.\r\n\r\nI had to touch a number of files to accommodate the differences between the new 92X interfaces and what is available in the 80X AOD.  A number of products have to be regenerated for this sequence to run (see the customization in the ootPhotonProducer_cff.py).  I tried following what was done in #19304 for customizing the configuration, as well as following along #19264 for minimally changing any code.  \r\n\r\nEDIT:  I forgot to mention I built this on top of an IB: CMSSW_9_2_X_2017-06-21-2300, so as to include those two PRs listed above.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 15, "closed_at": "1499104624", "comments": 51, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1498129049", "deletions": 133, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "d5de801d6aa1eff0973f2d14439a140c5ee954c5", "merged_at": "1499104624", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_3_X", "number": 19404, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 27, "state": "closed", "title": "ootPhotons for 80X Legacy reprocessing", "updated_at": "1499106408", "user": "kmcdermo"}

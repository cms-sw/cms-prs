It could also be useful in the future and for general Phase1 online DQM development. \r\n\r\nOne dataset (as returned from DAS) can have many runs, so we allow selecting a specific run. The\r\ndataset always has all events and will be fully processed, which can be too much for the online DQM, therefore we allow selecting a subset of LS (like in the lookarea).\r\n\r\nRemaining problem: The input files as reported from DAS appear in random order, so it can happen that many files have to be opened to find a small LS range, and the data will appear randomly in the DQM live view.\r\n\r\nThis configuration includes the dataset with the last 2016 pPb runs (again, as they were interesting for the Pilot Blade team and culd not be analysed using the online system). It is by default enabled in the `pixel` and `pixel_up` online clients after #16875 .", "branch": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1484044941", "comments": 24, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1481533095", "deletions": 24, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "5bd3af03f6a187069b7080b7516e524a1708fb25", "merged_at": "1484044941", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "number": 16973, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Make the online DQM fileinputsource more intelligent", "updated_at": "1484044941", "user": "schneiml"}

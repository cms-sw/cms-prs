There is now a DD4hep ideal geometry description in the Conditions DB, so a DD4hep workflow that reads geometry from the DB can be created.\r\n\r\nAddition to the PR/IB tests for this workflow is commented out for now until the Cond DB issue with creating payloads is resolved.\r\n\r\nThis PR depends on PR #34344 to run.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n`runTheMatrix.py` correctly creates the configuration for running this workflow. The workflow can run after the Cond DB issue with creating DB payloads is resolved.\r\n\r\nNo backport will be done.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1625758846", "comments": 41, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1625536879", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "pdmv-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved", "urgent"], "merge_commit_sha": "de609d6a0c942c84a54024d5f3b49179281228b9", "merged_at": "1625758846", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "number": 34343, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "[DD4hep] Add DD4hep Run 3 workflow that reads geometry from DB", "updated_at": "1625758846", "user": "cvuosalo"}

Also adds dictionary for output of this module when running on PFCandidates.\n\nThe use case is for L3 muons in HLT paths with PF iso, which are seen to occasionally overlap with PF Hadrons. Hopefully going to be a temporary fix until the PF behavior there is fully understood.\n\nThe implementation was discussed on the physTools hn:\nhttps://hypernews.cern.ch/HyperNews/CMS/get/physTools/3163/1/1/1/1/1/2/1/1/1.html\n\nWould also like to backport this to 70X if possible.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1394439060", "comments": 6, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1393232327", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "ce8731906e68149f9b91b96c52ff464805ec133d", "merged_at": "1394439060", "merged_by": "nclopezo", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_1_0_pre5", "number": 2614, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Delta R overlap filter for Candidates", "updated_at": "1403335466", "user": "olivito"}

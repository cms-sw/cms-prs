This leads to the crash of DT superlayer & layer producer in mb3, see report in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/36837#issuecomment-1046148021.\r\n\r\nThis code\r\nhttps://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/Geometry/DTGeometryBuilder/plugins/DTGeometryESModule.cc#L194-L195\r\nlooks for MuonBarrelDT in DD4hep detector construction.\r\n\r\nI currently migrate only M10. This should be OK if we want to use D88 as a starting point of DD4hep migration. However, migration of M9 or older is fine for me. This is to discuss with Geometry expert and come in the follow up PR.\r\n\r\nFYI @slomeo @ianna @civanch @cvuosalo \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nLocal test of workflow 39634.911 with #37005 runs until the ends. We have a warning from HCAL to follow (but it does not stop the job)\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\nNot a backport, and no need of backport\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": "1646238499", "comments": 21, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1645951555", "deletions": 7, "labels": ["geometry-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "upgrade-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "0a9d1197ffafc7820b630fd2a4db8a84d425fc43", "merged_at": "1646238499", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 37078, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix dtSpecsFilter XML used by Phase-2 wf for DD4hep", "updated_at": "1646238499", "user": "srimanob"}

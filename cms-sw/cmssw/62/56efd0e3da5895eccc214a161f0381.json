Histograms are filled in the pt and dxy plateau, as the other efficiencies.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRun raw2digi, L1Reco, reconstruction, dqmoffline and DQMoutput steps, on HLTMonitoring PD, run 370790.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

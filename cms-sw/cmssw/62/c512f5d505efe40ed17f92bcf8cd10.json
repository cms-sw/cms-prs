It reuses TopMonitor. The fix in this PR just updates `btagAlgo` as done in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/28067 for TOP.\r\n\r\nThis should confirm with @cms-sw/hlt-l2 if btagAlgo used in this PR is set properly. FYI @missirol \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nTry to run workflow 12434.0 and check DQM. I don't see noisy complain anymore, and DQM is filled.\r\nBefore this PR, BTV HLT is empty: https://tinyurl.com/ynfp3xj6\r\nWith this PR, histograms are filled: https://tinyurl.com/ymxs5emx\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

This bug fix causes new L1T emulation to be run in all scenarios where legacy GCT emulation was run, if postLS1 customization is made.  It also sets the l1extra producer to use simulated or unpacked digis based on context.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1417091567", "comments": 5, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1416925827", "deletions": 78, "labels": ["comparison-available", "l1-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "f53c0012b9fd47a9b27723018311bc577f8b35f4", "merged_at": "1417091567", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 6589, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "Run L1T emulation for Fast Simulation bugfix 730", "updated_at": "1445196177", "user": "mulhearn"}

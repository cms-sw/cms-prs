The data CLCTs and LCTs have their BX information truncated. I had previously added this PR #33335 to simulate this truncation in the emulator. Even with function, there will always be substantial differences because the BX's are defined differently in data and emulator. For that reason it is best to remove the BX comparisons for CLCT and LCT altogether. The ALCT BX is not truncated, so those comparisons still make sense.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles. \r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nTo be back-ported once #33357 is merged.\r\n\r\nBefore submitting your pull requests, make sure you followed this checklist:\r\n- verify that the PR is really intended for the chosen branch\r\n- verify that changes follow [CMS Naming, Coding, And Style Rules](http://cms-sw.github.io/cms_coding_rules.html)\r\n- verify that the PR passes the basic test procedure suggested in the [CMSSW PR instructions](https://cms-sw.github.io/PRWorkflow.html)\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1618334058", "comments": 19, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1617929365", "deletions": 12, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "5980deef40c0338bb9b7ddce4bc0a4d26cb6e874", "merged_at": "1618334058", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 33381, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Remove BX comparisons for CLCT and LCT in CSC L1T DQM [11_3_X]", "updated_at": "1618334058", "user": "dildick"}

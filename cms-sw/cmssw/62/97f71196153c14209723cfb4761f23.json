Here, TT channels are used (specifically the value of their `auxi1` parameter, the weight for the filter) to determine if the FIR filter should be used in HB and/or HE. The absence of TT channels in the `HcalTPChannelParameters` conditions OR a value of `-1.0` for the `auxi1` field is interpreted as to NOT use the new filter. These changes will mirror logic in online software that is used to determine if HCAL backend electronics should be configured to use the new FIR filter, thus giving equivalent behavior online and offline.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nBy default, with no changes made to the `HcalTPChannelParameters`, the default algorithm is used and no changes in trigger primitives are expected.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 11, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1631208220", "deletions": 41, "labels": ["l1-pending", "alca-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "number": 35222, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Configure HCAL FIR Filter Based on HcalTPChannelParameters", "updated_at": "1631541244", "user": "JHiltbrand"}

This means we must\r\navoid bins having the same bin names.\r\nHLTObjectsMonitor has a histogram which uses path names for the\r\nbin names. In the past, multiple bins could have the same path\r\nname. This change guarantees uniqueness for the bin names and\r\nonly fills a bin once per event.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 19, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1546009751", "deletions": 12, "labels": ["code-checks-pending", "comparison-pending", "dqm-pending", "hlt-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_5_X", "number": 25569, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "open", "title": "Make sure named bins are unique in HLTObjectsMonitor", "updated_at": "1546089853", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

The necessary changes for adding the Run3 MVA photon ID in NanoAOD has already been made in this PR.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 8, "comments": 19, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1667065613", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "requires-external", "code-checks-approved", "xpog-pending", "egamma"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_6_X", "number": 39927, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Photon MVA-based ID for Run3 from EGamma POG", "updated_at": "1667822853", "user": "Prasant1993"}

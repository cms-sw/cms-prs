If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nBackport of #48093 \r\n\r\nThis year the L1 Scouting team plan to collect the L1 calorimeter towers at 40 MHz (with a 2/9 prescale for technical reasons), which will allow us to do much finer grain analysis of jet-based objects than is currently possible. The hardware and firmware for this task has been installed and developed, and is now being commissioned for the start of data taking. In order to take this data, we require the new data format in this PR, which contains a small custom data format for the L1 towers, and the associated unpackers, producers and tests.\r\n\r\n\r\nAssociated data files are in: https://github.com/cms-data/DataFormats-L1Scouting/pull/5", "branch": "CMSSW_16_0_X", "changed_files": 32, "comments": 16, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1770297778", "deletions": 329, "labels": ["l1-pending", "core-pending", "daq-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "changes-dataformats"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_0_X", "number": 50044, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[16_0_X] [L1T] Calo towers L1 scouting data format update", "updated_at": "1770914232", "user": "tj710"}

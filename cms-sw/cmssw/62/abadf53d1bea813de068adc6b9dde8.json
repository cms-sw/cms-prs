The related classes NamedEventSelector and TriggerResultsBasedEventSelector had unnecessary data members that could be modified during the processing an event. This PR removes the unnecessary data. It also, for maintainability and clarity, changes some iterator loops to range based for loops.\nNote: Thread safety work also needs to be done on class EventSelector.  That will be a separate PR.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1440911470", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1440593824", "deletions": 178, "labels": ["comparison-available", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "a32ee1092b0fe2dd21a1bfcbe4a087eec4825ced", "merged_at": "1440911470", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 10951, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 4, "state": "closed", "title": "Thread Safety: Remove unneeded state from TriggerResultsBasedEventSelector", "updated_at": "1441383367", "user": "wmtan"}

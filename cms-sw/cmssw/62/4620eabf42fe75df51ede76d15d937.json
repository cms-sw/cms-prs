It is meant to be used with Powheg samples containing taus so that no Powheg events are lost.\r\n\r\nSince DecayHandler is meant to decay one particle at a time, while the standard Pythia tau decayer decays the correlated pair, part of the decay history is saved and then used to fill the products of the second (correlated) tau.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1589262385", "comments": 20, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1588009430", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "generators-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "1d67152641cf08ab411abb97a430061b0586a10f", "merged_at": "1589262385", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 29567, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Implementation of dedicated tau decayer for resonances", "updated_at": "1589262385", "user": "smrenna"}

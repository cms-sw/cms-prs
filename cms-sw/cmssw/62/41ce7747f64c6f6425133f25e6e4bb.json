This is currently impossible because if we register only one variable but more are provided, an `Unknown variable` error or raised.\r\n\r\nThere are two workarounds to this issue known to me:\r\n* Registering all variables everywhere\r\n* Parsing `sys.argv` ourselves\r\n\r\nBoth workarounds are not ideal.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a flag to `VarParsing.parseArguments()` method: `raise_if_not_registered`. The default value is `True` which ensures that all current usages behave the same. Passing `False` will ignore variables that are passed but not registered.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nPR was validated locally.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1595934521", "comments": 12, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1593773960", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "core-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 30525, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Added an option to not fail var parsing if var is provided but not registered", "updated_at": "1595934521", "user": "andrius-k"}

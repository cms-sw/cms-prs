This PR turns on the muon propagation error cuts, which mistakenly were turned off via https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/36883. Also, this PR simplifies the directory structure in the DQM output file and reduces redundant plots. In the offline DQM, the way to build the initial state muon propagations and a matching metric is changed. You can find more details [here](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1161504/contributions/4878468/attachments/2444237/4188150/SYang_220515.pdf).\r\nFrom a technical point of view, this PR adds base classes for online and offline efficiency monitors.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nBecause this PR affects both the online and the offline DQM, this PR was validated with two tests.\r\n- For the online DQM,\r\n```bash\r\nCMSSW_VERSION=CMSSW_12_3_X_2022-06-09-2300\r\ncmsrel ${CMSSW_VERSION}\r\ncd ${CMSSW_VERSION}/src\r\ngit-cms-merge-topic GEM-DQM-Eff-Update_from-${CMSSW_VERSION}\r\ngit-cms-addpkg DQM/Integration\r\ncmsRun ${CMSSW_BASE}/src/DQM/Integration/python/clients/gem_dqm_sourceclient-live_cfg.py unitTest=True\r\n```\r\n\r\n- For the offline DQM,\r\n```bash\r\nCMSSW_VERSION=CMSSW_12_3_X_2022-06-09-2300\r\ncmsrel ${CMSSW_VERSION}\r\ncd ${CMSSW_VERSION}/src\r\ngit-cms-merge-topic GEM-DQM-Eff-Update_from-${CMSSW_VERSION}\r\nrunTheMatrix.py -w upgrade -l 11611.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\nBackport of #37954.

This is done by modelling a Gaussian noise term common to all HGCAL hits and added as a bias to the ToA.\r\nThis is part of the set of updates already announced in the HGCAL DPG meeting (see https://indico.cern.ch/event/1158758/contributions/4880969/attachments/2451390/4201020/Timining%2020220525%20v2-2.pdf).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nPR was validated using the runTheMatrix.py -w upgrade -l 23234.103 test.\r\nHGCAL-related changes were mainly observed on the ToA distribution as expected while changes in the ADC are due to different number of calls of the random number generator, which causes some smearing visible at lower ADC values.\r\n\r\nPlots of ToA for jitter constant of 20 ps: \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14130873/188619506-f2bb8a52-274f-4b5f-8d61-01701809e731.png)\r\nPlots of ToA for jitter constant of 1000 ps: \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14130873/188619638-59ac1745-ccc5-4515-a432-0d235a4784d3.png)\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

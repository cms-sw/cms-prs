This repository can be cloned into `L1Trigger/L1TCalorimeter/python` and all imports should work as before. I have removed most of `L1Trigger/Configuration/python/customiseSettings` and have set it to try to search for the new caloParams directory, error-ing out with instructions if it is not found.\r\n\r\n@bundocka and @mitaylor since you two work with the caloParams the most, I want to run this solution by you before it is committed.\r\n\r\n### PR validation:\r\n\r\ncaloParams functions can be imported from the same path they were previously, provided this repository is present\r\n\r\n### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

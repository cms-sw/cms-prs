Otherwise we would need to do `*w.product();`, but that includes a check for `present` that we don't need when we can ensure in advance that `present` is true.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1761669432", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["core-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "ngt"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_0_X", "number": 49236, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Add a `const` overload of `bareProduct()` and a `markAsPresent()` method to `Wrapper.h`", "updated_at": "1761685615", "user": "ghyls"}

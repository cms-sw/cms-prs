Different runs of the workflow were giving one or the other of two sets of results.\r\n\r\nAfter PR #33199, it appears the instability has been fixed. Repeated tests of simulation with CMSSW_11_3_X_2021-04-02-1100 and  CMSSW_11_3_X_2021-04-06-1100 show consistent results (identical sequences of random seeds). It should be safe to run this workflow for PR tests.\r\n\r\nNo backport is needed.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1617772547", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1617739556", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "pdmv-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "93a7b79ede73dd6c37492973a3a00d8abdcffeb4", "merged_at": "1617772547", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 33351, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "[DD4hep] Re-enable DD4hep workflow 11634.911 for PR tests", "updated_at": "1617772547", "user": "cvuosalo"}

No changes are made unless the `run2` era is explicitly activated.\n\nTesting has been limited. I just checked that the particular modules have the changes applied when the era is activated. If it's not activated then there is no change. I'll worry about confirming identity between the two methods (customisation versus era) once all the pull requests are in.\n\nI haven't taken the customisations out of the run2 helper function `customiseRun2EraExtras`. The postLS1Customs.py file is being heavily modified by #7579, and this would likely cause a conflict. Applying the modification twice has no harm (well, event content commands are added twice but I think that's harmless) so I'll remove those lines in a later pull request.  It's only temporary anyway.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1423721281", "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1423664584", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "63e4441c1e6771d63702506d4edf4d8713931c66", "merged_at": "1423721281", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 7676, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add HCal digitisation changes to the run2 era", "updated_at": "1438586600", "user": "mark-grimes"}

I left the original logic of the most complicated form (`HcalTopology::validHcal(const HcalDetId& id, const unsigned int flag)`) in a block comment because it took me ~6 tries to come up with a single-line statement that matched the output of the original. The new version actually reduces the number of function calls, and I printed out every possible case in a simple C++ program to make sure the output is identical.\r\n\r\nattn: @bsunanda ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1520862396", "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1520545794", "deletions": 7, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "f27ad80f15222ca91213a6cea4db7eb720451c0a", "merged_at": "1520862396", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_1_X", "number": 22540, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "avoid some temporaries in HcalTopology", "updated_at": "1520862396", "user": "kpedro88"}

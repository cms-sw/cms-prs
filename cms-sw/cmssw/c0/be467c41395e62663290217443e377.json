I left the original logic of the most complicated form (`HcalTopology::validHcal(const HcalDetId& id, const unsigned int flag)`) in a block comment because it took me ~6 tries to come up with a single-line statement that matched the output of the original. The new version actually reduces the number of function calls, and I printed out every possible case in a simple C++ program to make sure the output is identical.\r\n\r\nattn: @bsunanda ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1520545794", "deletions": 7, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "geometry-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_1_X", "number": 22540, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "avoid some temporaries in HcalTopology", "updated_at": "1520558370", "user": "kpedro88"}

Looking at some of them and they look reasonable. These files can be found on [CERNBOX](https://cernbox.cern.ch/s/Lknj0cBX7yIiY1y).\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nThis is not a backport, but a backport to 15_0_X will likely follow.\r\n\r\nFYI: @silviodonato \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 11, "comments": 3, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1758721415", "deletions": 47, "labels": ["operations-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-approved", "xpog-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_0_X", "number": 48984, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[15_1_X] Update skipEventsWithoutScoutingByEra for ScoutingNano", "updated_at": "1758722888", "user": "patinkaew"}

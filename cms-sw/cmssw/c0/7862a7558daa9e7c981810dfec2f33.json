Thus the HLT DQM and validation sequences (and harvestings) get run without purpose. This lead e.g. to the issue described at https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/47352#issuecomment-2667155969 in which wf 24034.0 (that runs the `@fake2` menu) was trying to consume HLT collection that were not present on file.\r\nThis PR introduces a  `@phase2FakeHLT` (DQM) `@phase2ValidationFakeHLT` (Validation) sequences that can be run in phase-2 workflows in which there is no intention to run the HLT step (similarly as for what is done in Run3).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n   * `runTheMatrix.py -l phase2` runs fine\r\n   * `runTheMatrix.py -l 24034.0 -t 4 -j 8 --ibeos` runs fine (this is for a geometry in which we don't run )\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

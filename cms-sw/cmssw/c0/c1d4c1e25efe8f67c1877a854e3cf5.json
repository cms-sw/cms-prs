As well, empty Y-axis labels are now simply given their corresponding bin number, to prevent empty string labels causing issues as seen before in #32250. This PR fixes the issue first spotted on this hypernews thread: https://hypernews.cern.ch/HyperNews/CMS/get/tier0-Ops/2192.html\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with a description of which tests have been performed to verify the correctness of the PR, including the eventual addition of new code for testing like unit tests, test configurations, additions or updates to the runTheMatrix test workflows -->\r\n\r\nAll code compiles, and produces expected plots as seen when using `runTheMatrix.py`. Using @silviodonato 's method to test the DQM merging step, this code eliminates the merging error seen.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nThis PR is not a backport. However, it does need to be forward port-ed to 11_3_X and master.\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1612475306", "comments": 15, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1612437376", "deletions": 26, "labels": ["dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved", "urgent"], "merge_commit_sha": "7cd6db48d7e869028eee94741a1450012cd034f3", "merged_at": "1612475306", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 32815, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Calo l1 last20 mismatches axis fix", "updated_at": "1612530365", "user": "aloeliger"}

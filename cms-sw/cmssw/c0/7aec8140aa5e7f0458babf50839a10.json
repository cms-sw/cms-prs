This is rather unphysical and in some cases -depending on particle mass/momentum- it results in particles that reach into the outer detectors faster than lightspeed. This can throw the timing of local reconstruction algorithms off: either failing to reconstruct the physical object or assigning it a wrong BX which makes samples generated with this setup -DisplacedMuon guns for example- unreliable. We've checked this kind of effects happen for local L1 muon reconstruction, with DT trigger primitives suffering from both of these two effects.\r\n\r\nThe proposed fix is to add timing information to the vertexes to take into account the time of flight from the origin from an hypothetical invisible parnent.\r\n\r\nTagging @dildick as well as the original author in case he wants to comment.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nscram build code-format run without code checks warnings/changes\r\nscram build runs successfully without warnings", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1618010744", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1617955249", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "generators-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "458b46ad8c39de3239a171d4364cbceff0659d17", "merged_at": "1618010744", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 33382, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Added time info to the displaced vertexes for muon guns", "updated_at": "1618010745", "user": "cericeci"}

The correct location is fact in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/tree/CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC/Geometry/GEMGeometryBuilder/python (not https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/tree/CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC/Geometry/GEMGeometry/python)\n- Extended2023HGCal does not have ME0 (https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/SWGuideUpgradeGeom#Extended2023HGCal)\n- Not included suggestion: include GEMGeometryBuilder module in Extended2023TTI \n  (https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/SWGuideUpgradeGeom#Extended2023TTI)\n\nEDIT:\n- comp11 is an unused parameter in GEMGeometryBuilder. It is present and used in the RPCGeometryBuilder though. Since the GEMGeometryBuilder package is pretty much a copy-paste of RPCGeometryBuilder, we inherited that param. I deleted it. \n- useDDD is now a tracked parameter.\n- GEMGeometryParsFromDD.cc and GEMGeometryParsFromDD.h have never been used (we only need ...FromDDD and ...FromCondDB). Also these files were probably copied straight from the RPC code. I deleted them as well. \n- Finally, I made some aesthetic changes to the ME0GeometryAnalyzer code and configs. \n", "branch": "CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "changed_files": 34, "closed_at": "1402587998", "comments": 13, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1402426679", "deletions": 135, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "geometry-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "b3bcf72018c49b8d0bf60fd84c5a59e0b3c910fe", "merged_at": "1402587998", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "number": 4201, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "62X SLHC GEMGeometryBuilder cleanup", "updated_at": "1404148669", "user": "dildick"}

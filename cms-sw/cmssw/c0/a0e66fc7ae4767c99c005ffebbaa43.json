Trivial : Adding AK8 jet corrections (now available in 72x)\n2. Adding nsubjettiness.\n3. Removing QJets volatility (too slow)\n4. Adding CMS top tagger correctly.\n   = To do this, had to \"forward\" the value map of CA8Jet->CATopTagInfo to the associated AK8Jet->CATopTagInfo. Invented a new delta-R matching module for this (JetDeltaRTagInfoValueMapProducer.cc). \n   = Also had a bug fix for the jet tools file when running CATopTagger. Was not loading the right file under the right conditions. \n\nThe added material is the CATopTagInfos. Instead of accessing via user floats, it is sufficient to keep the \"tag infos\" to maintain backwards compatibility. They only contribute 3 floats (plus refs) for each jet with pt > 100 GeV. The CATopTag algorithm itself is not run, since that is done in RECO and we just take the value. The CA8 jets are associated to the AK8 jets to get the right association of the AK8 jets to the CATopTag values. \n\nAlso adding @gpetruc and @arizzi to the thread to have them weigh in. \n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_2_X", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1411641538", "comments": 15, "commits": 10, "created_at": "1411066943", "deletions": 22, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "e7128b4efa3910d8102503afa474948e81ba75fe", "merged_at": "1411641538", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_2_X", "number": 5425, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 18, "state": "closed", "title": "MiniAOD JME changes", "updated_at": "1416853444", "user": "rappoccio"}

Most of these are in DataFormats, where the use of the uninitialized variables was reported in the output module.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTrivial technical fix, no physics or computational performance changes expected.  A limited matrix test found no unexpected failures.\r\n\r\nResolves https://github.com/cms-sw/framework-team/issues/1748\r\nResolves https://github.com/cms-sw/framework-team/issues/1745\r\nResolves https://github.com/cms-sw/framework-team/issues/1744\r\nResolves https://github.com/cms-sw/framework-team/issues/1750\r\nResolves https://github.com/cms-sw/framework-team/issues/1747\r\nResolves https://github.com/cms-sw/framework-team/issues/1751\r\nResolves https://github.com/cms-sw/framework-team/issues/1752\r\nResolves https://github.com/cms-sw/framework-team/issues/1746\r\nResolves https://github.com/cms-sw/framework-team/issues/1749\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 10, "comments": 9, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1766767136", "deletions": 32, "labels": ["generators-pending", "daq-approved", "l1-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_1_X", "number": 49705, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Fixes for uninitialized variable use detected by valgrind", "updated_at": "1767053022", "user": "dan131riley"}

The customisation functions are left to be removed later.\n\nMost of the changes here were assumed for auto-forward-port of #13945 but were locked out due to conflicts in other areas.\nThis PR is needed to get #14267 going. @makortel \n\nConfiguration/DataProcessing/python/Modifiers.py and RecoVertex/BeamSpotProducer/python/Modifiers.py are not fully used at this point. More extensive use is pending Eras.py refactoring.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 22, "closed_at": "1462355721", "comments": 14, "commits": 20, "created_at": "1462270382", "deletions": 691, "labels": ["alca-pending", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "49a7851b370d7843d5fc5bb864d042703e5c2b10", "merged_at": "1462355721", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 14350, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "sync with 80X and cleanup of obsolete T0 processing scenarios", "updated_at": "1462355721", "user": "slava77"}

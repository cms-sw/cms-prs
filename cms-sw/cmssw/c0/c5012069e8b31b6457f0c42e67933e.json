The configurable parameter, `applyFixPCC` is only turned on in Run 3 condition by `run3_common` modifier, and apply the fix described in #34572. The impact by this PR is presented in [the presentation](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1061449/contributions/4460835/attachments/2286772/3886949/Comissioning_1TS_Scheme_21Jul23.pdf). The agreement between the Trigger Primitive energy for PFA1' and the RecHit energy for MAHI in high energy is achieved by this change in Run3 MC. \r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nA basic technical test was performed: runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nThis PR is not a backport.

The update is highly related to previous PR [cmssw#48398 (New HLT Scouting DQM Online Client)](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/48398) i.e. here we introduce scouting egamma part into HLT Scouting DQM online client for the DQMOnlineScoutingstream. This progress has been mentioned in the [scouting meeting at 28 Aug 2025.](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1579341/contributions/6655674/subcontributions/568712/attachments/3124961/5542266/ScoutingEGamma_Report_DPNote_2025Aug28.pdf)\r\n\r\n**Description of the current change**\r\n\r\n- Add options `useOfflineObject` in the config files under the original `HLTriggerOffline/Scouting`. In online stream, we could choose not to use any offline object by such options.\r\n- Add EGM part to online stream config file accordingly.\r\n- **Note**: The current file `HLTriggerOffline/Scouting/python/HLTScoutingEGammaPostProcessing_cff.py`, which corresponds to the DQM Harvester, uses offline objects to achieve more accurate Tag-and-Probe measurements. Therefore, this postprocessor is not included in the online DQM sequence. (Similarly, in previous PR, for scouting muons, the harvester defined in `HLTriggerOffline/Scouting/python/ScoutingMuonMonitoring_Client_cff.py` is not used in Online DQM.) This is mentioned here for completeness. \r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with a description of the feature proposed or problem addressed, specifying:\r\n  - what changes are expected in the output if any, \r\n  - what other PRs or externals it depends upon if any,\r\n  - link to any additional material useful to provide a documentation for this PR (slides, JIRA tickets, related pull requestes, hypernews, TWiki or Indico pages)  -->\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nThis PR has been prepared from `CMSSW_15_1_X_2025-08-27-2300`\r\n```\r\ncmsrel CMSSW_15_1_X_2025-08-27-2300\r\ncd CMSSW_15_1_X_2025-08-27-2300/src\r\ncmsenv\r\ngit cms-init\r\ngit cms-addpkg DQM/Integration DQM/HLTEvF HLTriggerOffline/Scouting/\r\nscram b && scram b code-checks && scram b code-format && scram b\r\n```\r\nCheck the code dependency and its output\r\n```\r\ngit cms-checkdeps -a -A\r\n\r\n>> Checking DQM/Integration CMSSW_15_1_X_2025-08-27-2300\r\n   x DQM/Integration/python/clients/scouting_dqm_sourceclient-live_cfg.py\r\n>> Checking HLTriggerOffline/Scouting CMSSW_15_1_X_2025-08-27-2300\r\n   x HLTriggerOffline/Scouting/plugins/ScoutingEGammaCollectionMonitoring.cc\r\n   x HLTriggerOffline/Scouting/plugins/ScoutingElectronTagProbeAnalyzer.cc\r\n   x HLTriggerOffline/Scouting/python/HLTScoutingEGammaDqmOffline_cff.py\r\n   x HLTriggerOffline/Scouting/python/ScoutingEGammaCollectionMonitoring_cfi.py\r\n   x HLTriggerOffline/Scouting/python/ScoutingElectronTagProbeAnalyzer_cfi.py\r\n   x HLTriggerOffline/Scouting/test/runScoutingMonitoringDQM_EGammaOnly_step1_cfg.py\r\nChecking out these packages: 1\r\nDQMOffline/HLTScouting (python)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd\r\n```\r\n runTheMatrix.py -l 145.314\r\n```\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with a description of which tests have been performed to verify the correctness of the PR, including the eventual addition of new code for testing like unit tests, test configurations, additions or updates to the runTheMatrix test workflows -->\r\n\r\n#### Backport plan:\r\nThis is not backport but it will be backported to 15.0.X for 2025 data taking operations.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please delete the text above after you verified all points of the checklist  -->\r\n(c.c.

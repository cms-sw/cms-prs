In particular, it confused my unused dependency checker, because you can't declare another plugins library as a dependency. That forced us to declare the dependencies of the `CondCore/PCLConfigPlugins` plugins library also in `CondCore/PCLConfigPlugins`, which caused false positives in the unused-dependency checks.\r\n\r\nThis commit fixes the situation by moving the header file into the `plugins` directory. To avoid confusing a plugin library with a regular library in the future, the plugin library that was defined in the top-level of `CondCore/PCLConfigPlugins` got also moved to be another build target in the `plugins` subdirectory, in a way such that the compiled library name doesn't change.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "comments": 0, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1670320592", "deletions": 12, "labels": ["db-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "number": 40245, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Move all PCLConfigPlugins sources to `plugins`", "updated_at": "1670320617", "user": "guitargeek"}

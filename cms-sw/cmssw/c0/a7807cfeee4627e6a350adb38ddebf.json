This is the default timing algorithm for Run 1 and Run 2.\r\nFor Run 3 and Phase 2 a new modifier `run3_ecal` is used to change the timing algorithm to CC timing and use different records with the label 'CC' for the timing calibrations and timing offset constants.\r\n\r\nNote that this behaviour is different than what was discussed in the [meeting](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1329876/) on the 27th Sept. when the plan was made to make the CC timing the default and use eras to modify Run 1 and Run 2 configurations to use the ratio method. Since Run 1 configurations could not be modified using eras we decided to reverse the behaviour as in the description above.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe PR passes Run 1 and Run2 WFs in the limited matrix tests but currently fails all Run 3 and Phase 2 WFs because the consumed records with the 'CC' label are not yet in the GTs.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1696247506", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "operations-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending", "ecal"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_3_X", "number": 42928, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Use ECAL ratio timing algorithm for Run 1 and Run 2, and CC timing algorithm for Run 3 and beyond", "updated_at": "1696247701", "user": "thomreis"}

This PR fixes the problem by adding a fall-back to the `OnlineLuminosityRecord ` provided by the S/W FED 1023.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n`cmssw` compiles, unit tests are running correctly.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nverbatim backport of #38384", "branch": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "changed_files": 7, "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1655360208", "deletions": 14, "labels": ["alca-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "backport"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 38385, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[12.3.X] `CalibTracker`: fallback to the `OnlineLuminosityRecord` when SCAL is not available", "updated_at": "1655360317", "user": "mmusich"}

The IB logs mostly detect it in the [arm backend](https://cmssdt.cern.ch/SDT/cgi-bin/newQA.py?arch=el8_aarch64_gcc12&release=CMSSW_15_0_X_2025-01-06-1100), but I've found the reported error when trying to run the 29850.778 workflow. Curiously, this issue is only present in the IBs: I have not been able to reproduce it starting from CMSSW_15_0_0_pre1 and just merging #46897. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n**I've tested the fix once again on 29834 and 29850 workflows with no modifiers as well as .777 and .778 in both cases.**  No such error is reported anymore.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 13, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1736260491", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["hlt-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "bug-fix", "code-checks-approved", "ngt"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_0_X", "number": 47049, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[NGT] Fix double inclusion of Phase2HLTMuonSelectorForL3 module ", "updated_at": "1736335207", "user": "Parsifal-2045"}

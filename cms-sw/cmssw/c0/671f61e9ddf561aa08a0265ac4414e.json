This was briefly discussed with @perrotta.\r\nThe package contains only muon DPG-related nanoAOD stuff, hence it was suggested to add @cms-sw/xpog-l2  as reviewers.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe PR integrates the code, but it does not include modules in workflows for now.\r\nIt was tested that code compiles and passes `code-format` and `code-checks`.\r\n\r\nA test recipe  was used to validate the ntuple production:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncmsenv\r\n\r\ncd DPGAnalysis/MuonTools/test\r\n\r\nvoms-proxy-init -voms cms -valid 192:0\r\n\r\ncmsRun muDpgNtuples_cfg.py\r\n\r\n$CMSSW_RELEASE_BASE/src/PhysicsTools/NanoAOD/test/inspectNanoFile.py MuDPGNtuple_nanoAOD_ZMMPU.root --docmd=doc.md --sizemd=size.md\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt the moment of the PR, the recipe runs fine in the latest IB, and produces an [ntuple whose type, number and size of branches](https://gist.github.com/battibass/5181500429538c365973ff34efd09838), match well what shown at cross-POG (total size of event branches, in Run3 ZMM MC including pile-up, is around 3.3 kB / ev)", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 27, "comments": 26, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1654247444", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "new-package-pending", "code-checks-pending", "xpog-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_2_X", "number": 38226, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Integration of the first version of muon DPG nanoAOD ntuples", "updated_at": "1685609710", "user": "battibass"}

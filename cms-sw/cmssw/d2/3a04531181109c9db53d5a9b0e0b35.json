At the time there was a PR to a backport -- PR #22743 -- to merge it into the online/offline production version, and while it was patched online, the PR was closed unmerged since we moved to 10_1_X.\r\n\r\nThe other commit introduces some changes to the timing cuts. The cuts on rechits included in the ECAL timing plots were out of date. Especially in the forward region, most of the rechits passing the cuts were pure noise and created a few false alarms. The commit introduces these changes:\r\n\r\n(1) Update thresholds on rechit energy for rechits to be included in the timing plots.\r\n\r\n(2) Introduce cut on timing error to match offline processing.\r\n\r\n(3) Implement separate energy thresholds for forward region in EE.\r\n\r\nLink to corresponding PR for CMSSW master: #23283 ", "branch": "CMSSW_10_1_X", "changed_files": 5, "comments": 1, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1527001378", "deletions": 20, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "dqm-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_1_X", "number": 23284, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "New timing cuts for ECAL (for online/offline production)", "updated_at": "1527001484", "user": "tanmaymudholkar"}

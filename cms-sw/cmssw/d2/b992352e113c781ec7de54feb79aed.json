Namely:\r\n\r\n* it introduces a proper pixel tracking and vertexing based on 2017 tracking and detector\r\n* it updates the output file of the beampixel application to be compatible with DIP usage\r\n* it rewrites the logic with which the online BS output files are written to disk.\r\n* it tunes the global tracking region for pixel tracking in order to be able to compute the BS position using the canonical d0-phi fit.\r\n\r\nIt includes #19012 so I'd suggest integrating this one that goes beyond that one.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1496462438", "comments": 11, "commits": 9, "created_at": "1496250853", "deletions": 134, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "070119fd77f30bcc8f43d0a82f20bf6898e1bb58", "merged_at": "1496462438", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_2_X", "number": 19050, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Update online bs with pv information master", "updated_at": "1496462438", "user": "rovere"}

Also in this case the same comments apply: we need to make this an automatic rescaling with PU, but as usual we are on hurry (if we have time we will do it now). We add also some customization functions to switch off the neutron background when we go with the GEANT simulation. The functions will be updated using the latest FLUKA+GEANT results soon. In that case the safetyFactor will be set to 1.\r\n\r\n@pietverwilligen @jshlee @kpedro88 @bapavlov ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": "1491478539", "comments": 35, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1490623746", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "57bf6d6ffda06be1c4fa3f59915481911ca17dd0", "merged_at": "1491478539", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_1_X", "number": 18096, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 8, "state": "closed", "title": "Neutron background rescale for GE1/1 and GE2/1", "updated_at": "1491478539", "user": "calabria"}

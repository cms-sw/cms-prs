It implements what is know internally as \"v6.1_l1\" tracking. That consists of L1 tracks +  pixelTracks (w cluster removal from L1) + initialStep (seeded from pixelTracks as recovery) + highPtTriplet step.\r\nThis is the initial commit for that line of work, so no changes expected.\r\nThis is the initial commit for that line of work, so it does not depend on any other PR or externals.\r\nDocumentation:\r\n  * Tracking v6.1, by Hevjin Yarar and Mia Tosi:  [here](https://indico.cern.ch/event/909499/contributions/3826040/subcontributions/304054/attachments/2032371/3401815/Presentation_-_May_5_2020.pdf)\r\n  * Configuration with L1 tracks added before all L1 tracking, by Adriano di Florio: [here](https://indico.cern.ch/event/934495/contributions/3926174/subcontributions/310046/attachments/2070167/3475102/HLT_Phase2_Status_Jul2020_Upgrade.pdf)\r\n\r\nThis is a cleanup of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/30817, after all the discussion there.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nAdded two files in HLTrigger/Configuration/test subdirectory to test the new functionalities.

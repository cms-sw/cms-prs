This PR starts with JetMET-only path for now.\r\nThe difference than original PR is to avoid a lot of empty histograms from HLT validation by enable one-by-one validation, starting from JetMET.\r\n\r\n> This PR is a companion of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/42783.\r\nChanges needed to the Tracking and Vertexing Validation (w.r.t. Simulation) @ HLT sequence for the Phase-2 setup.\r\nThis relies on the current naming of the tracking collections for the phase-2 HLT:\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRun successfully `runTheMatrix.py -l 24834.0 -t 4 -j 8 --ibeos` and checked that HLT tracking and vertexing validation plots are filled.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

These tube shapes had a slight error in their phi extent, being from 0.1 degrees to 7 degrees too large.\r\nWhile developing the code to create the simulation geometry XML DB payload with DD4hep, I validated my code by checking each geometry component between old DD and DD4hep. These checks revealed this slight discrepancy in these non-sensitive volumes.\r\n\r\nIn `DDTIBLayerAlgo.cc` two solids had slightly incorrect sizes, which were corrected. The solid definitions are in loops, so actually about 30 solids are affected, being the pillars and ribs.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, and unrelated, the validation also showed there was a misnamed solid in `DDEcalBarrelNewAlgo.cc` , and it was fixed.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe full XML geometry descriptions for old DD and DD4hep were compared to check these fixes corrected the discrepancies between them. Also, the 11634.911 DD4hep workflow was run successfully.\r\n\r\nThese fixes could be backported to 11_3, but I'm not sure if that is really necessary.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1623656058", "comments": 31, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1623356537", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "7b669017b222e845be4d2455658a150b2991b704", "merged_at": "1623656058", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "number": 34088, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 18, "state": "closed", "title": "[DD4hep] Minor size correction of 0.1 to 7 degrees in phi for tube shapes that are non-sensitive TIB pillars and ribs", "updated_at": "1623656058", "user": "cvuosalo"}

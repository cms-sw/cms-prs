This PR has the straightforward approach, i.e. to define 6 ESGetTokens and then decide in `produce()` which of the 6 possible tokens to use for the `get()`.\r\n\r\nBut this approach (alone) is not necessarily what we want, as naively it would lead the framework to load all 6 payloads in prefetching (or those that are available in the GlobalTag, ~~by quick look at least the HLT run2 data GT has all 6 payloads, while corresponding RECO GT has only one~~ in case a GT would not have all of them).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles, no changes expected.\r\n\r\n@Dr15Jones ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1560862189", "comments": 37, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1559324477", "deletions": 43, "labels": ["alca-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "hold", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27043, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "[RFC] Migrate SiPixelGenErrorDBObjectESProducer and SiPixelTemplateDBObjectESProducer to EventSetup consumes", "updated_at": "1560862201", "user": "makortel"}

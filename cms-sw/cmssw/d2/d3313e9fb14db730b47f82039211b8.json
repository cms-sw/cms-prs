The actual LUTs are stored in CSCUpgradeMotherboardLUT. Most LUTs are currently empty but will be filled soon.\r\n* This PR also introduces base classes for the upgrade TMBs: (1) CSCUpgradeMotherboard which is a common class for all upgrade CSC-GEM and CSC-RPC TMBs and (2) CSCGEMMotherboard which is derived from CSCUpgradeMotherboard. The latter will form the base class for the specific classes CSCGEMMotherboardME11, CSCGEMMotherboardME21.  \r\n* In a follow up pull request I will change the names of CSCMotherboardME11GEM and CSCMotherboardME21GEM to CSCGEMMotherboardME11 and CSCGEMMotherboardME21 respectively, and I will let them derive from CSCGEMMotherboard. CSCMotherboardME3141RPC will be renamed to CSCRPCMotherboard and will derive from CSCUpgradeMotherboard.\r\n* No changes with respect to the run-2 or phase-2 work flows are expected, since none of this code is enabled yet.

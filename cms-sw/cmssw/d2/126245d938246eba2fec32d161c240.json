In that PR packing was changed from (8, 9, 4, 11) ->  (11, 11, 0, 10) /(row, col, time, adc) which can accommodate 2048x2048 pixels (row x column), \r\nrow = 11bits -> 2^11 = 2048, col = 11bits -> 2^11 = 2048.\r\n\r\nWith this PR the packing changes from  (11, 11, 0, 10) ->  (11, 10, 0, 10), reducing row x column to 2048x1024.    However, this would fit all Phase II use cases (both for 25x100 m2  and  50x50 m2) as there are max 1354 (rows)*434 (cols) in the case of 2x2 rectangular pixel layout.\r\n\r\nNo changes are expected. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nNo failure when running runTheMatrix.py.\r\n\r\n@emiglior, @mmusich , @veszpv ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1626481998", "comments": 12, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1626377465", "deletions": 10, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "3bb685f675b96a6b25575a113076ca6039d6ae51", "merged_at": "1626481998", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "number": 34509, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Reserve one bit for flagging individual pixels", "updated_at": "1626481998", "user": "tsusa"}

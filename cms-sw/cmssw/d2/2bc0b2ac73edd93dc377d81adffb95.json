There are a couple of places where older things were not in place that needed to change (like, CA6 --> CA8) so that the unscheduled mode could work correctly. \n\nThere is one change to the pat::Jet dataformat to add a method that gets a list of TagInfos in the object. This should have been in place for some time but it's needed for the newer functionalities since top tags can also be in the tag info list. \n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "changed_files": 1315, "closed_at": "1406638766", "comments": 7, "commits": 1602, "created_at": "1406245906", "deletions": 452883, "labels": ["alca-pending", "analysis-pending", "comparison-pending", "core-pending", "db-pending", "dqm-pending", "geometry-pending", "hlt-pending", "l1-pending", "new-package-pending", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-rejected", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "number": 4784, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "B2G CSA14 code integration : 71x", "updated_at": "1406638766", "user": "rappoccio"}

A basic plot is shown below.\r\n - The red histogram is after the eta cut while the blue histogram is before cut. An |eta|<2.15 has been applied as can be observed by comparing the plots. \r\n - Code checks and code format performed\r\n - Based on advice from @Martin-Grunewald on a similar PR at https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/39764, it was decided to change the `HLTEgammaEtFilter` class in place of adding a new class. \r\n\r\n#### PR backport:\r\n\r\n - PR needs to be backported to CMSSW_12_4_X and 12_5_X\r\n - The current software at HLT is in the 12_4_X release. Hence the need for backport.\r\n \r\n![Screenshot from 2022-10-19 09-12-41](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32368439/196621814-b7d632e2-7a4e-4cf4-a920-67620937927e.png)", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 2, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1666251437", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["hlt-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_6_X", "number": 39789, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "open", "title": "Add Eta cut to HLT Egamma objects.", "updated_at": "1666252256", "user": "arsahasransu"}

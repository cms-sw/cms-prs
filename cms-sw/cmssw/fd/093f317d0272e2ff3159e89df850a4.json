These changes should be in CMSSW_7_3_X and later. \n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 19, "closed_at": "1422967538", "comments": 6, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1421406626", "deletions": 336, "labels": ["alca-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "b20fdf5cb950cbaecdd581f5ef1a886012a6123e", "merged_at": "1422967538", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 7220, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "added missing pixel features from CVS-head", "updated_at": "1422967538", "user": "clelange"}

After the occurrence of such cases, an object collection (let's say, Anti-Leptons) actually is a mix of true Anti-Leptons and fakes from true Leptons (opposite for original Leptons collection). More detailed explanation of code's performance without bugfix is given in HN message \"1\" as indicated below, while message \"2\" leads to performance plots before/after bugfix.\n\nPlease check these messages on the HyperNews:\n1. https://hypernews.cern.ch/HyperNews/CMS/get/top/2302/1/2/1.html\n2. https://hypernews.cern.ch/HyperNews/CMS/get/top/2302/1/2/1/1.html\n3. https://hypernews.cern.ch/HyperNews/CMS/get/top/2302/1/2/1/1/1.html\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1476455758", "comments": 8, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1476283319", "deletions": 8, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "78b4ca2765607df8422df17e382815934cbc5a29", "merged_at": "1476455758", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 16190, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "BugFix for PseudoTop construction in dilepton channel using proper lepton charges", "updated_at": "1476455759", "user": "msavitskyi"}

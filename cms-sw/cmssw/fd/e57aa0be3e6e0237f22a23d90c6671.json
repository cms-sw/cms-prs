This pull request enables the use of an me0.xml file introduced earlier by Sunanda in which the ME0 detector is split in 10 eta partitions (#14537). In a forthcoming pr we will include realistic digitization (w.r.t. the pseudodigitization included in the release). We would like to stress that for the muon upgrade simulations this PR his highly desired to enter into the 810 release, please test. Thanks.\n\nNB I tried both:\nscram b vclean && scram b -k -j 48\nscram b vclean && scram build -k -j 48 USER_CXXFLAGS='-fsyntax-only' COMPILER='llvm compile'\nwith a good outcome. \n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 0, "closed_at": "1476255171", "comments": 29, "commits": 0, "created_at": "1475743933", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "geometry-pending", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 16114, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "810 me0 geometry pr v1", "updated_at": "1476259532", "user": "pietverwilligen"}

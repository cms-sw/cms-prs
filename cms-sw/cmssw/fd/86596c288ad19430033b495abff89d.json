It only makes the definitions of the nested class/struct public.\nThis has been tested with checkdeps -a and the relval matrix.\n\nIn some cases, the declarations were moved to keep the public and private sections of the class each contiguous.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1382341176", "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1382063181", "deletions": 23, "labels": ["alca-approved", "analysis-approved", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "9d73337abbba6de3f9260a0bb2c46fe855e74625", "merged_at": "1382341176", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_0_0_pre7", "number": 1104, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "nested structs of persistent classes must be public in ROOT 6 (again)", "updated_at": "1403110934", "user": "wmtan"}

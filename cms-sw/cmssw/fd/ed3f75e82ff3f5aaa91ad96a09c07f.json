When the compatibility requirement fails, the time of the hit with the smallest error is now assigned to the track.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nThe code compiles and was tested running on the 24807.0 workflow.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1699005764", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "upgrade-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_3_X", "number": 43177, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "fix for tracks with two ETL hits and no time assigned", "updated_at": "1699257906", "user": "martinamalberti"}

We will have to remember to then swtich to use the output of wf 140 as the new input GEN-SIM for these wfs, when it becomes available.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1434274528", "comments": 21, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1432890108", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "operations-approved", "pdmv-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "ec5f232dc25ad5ea2cc954b0e31a3abbaac673a3", "merged_at": "1434274528", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 9330, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Update default vtx smearing for PbPb to 2015 expectation", "updated_at": "1434274528", "user": "mandrenguyen"}

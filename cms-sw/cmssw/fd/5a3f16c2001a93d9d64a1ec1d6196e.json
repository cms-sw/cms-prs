Then, as a preparatory step, the `iterNLargeD0` track algorithm enumerators are reused for upcoming new Phase1 tracking iterations (two of them are not needed now, so they're marked as reserved). They are intentionally not yet used (in Phase1PU70 and PU140 configurations), because I want to keep the current state until we have finalized the validation of Phase1 tracking in 80X against 62X_SLHC.\n\nTested in 800pre2, no changes expected.\n\n@rovere @VinInn \n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1448418404", "comments": 20, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1447767285", "deletions": 72, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "ea270b842d1ed3c8b07114004234d11fa2ba59c5", "merged_at": "1448418404", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 12458, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Remove last bits of LargeD0 iterations, and add Phase1 iteration enumerators", "updated_at": "1476956908", "user": "makortel"}

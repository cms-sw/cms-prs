This class will be added also in the online DB and O2O script will be provided in a subsequent PR. \r\n\r\nDetails about the format of the new DB classes can be found in slide 10 and 11 of this presentation [1]\r\nA follow-up PR will be prepared for the changes to the Ecal Trigger emulator and O2O scripts. \r\n\r\nThis PR should not change any output. \r\n\r\nThe PR also adds the xml dump capability for the mustache SC parameters and the dynamic dPhi parameters. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTest payloads have been already uploaded by ECAL experts in the ProdDB for the tags following tags:\r\n- EcalTPGTPMode_v2_hlt  (same as Run2_default)\r\n- EcalTPG_TPMode_Run2_default_v0\r\n- EcalTPG_TPMode_Run3_zeroing_v0\r\n- EcalTPGOddWeightIdMap_v2_hlt\r\n- EcalTPGOddWeightGroup_v2_hlt\r\n- EcalTPGOddWeightGroup_v0\r\n- EcalTPGOddWeightIdMap_v0\r\n\r\n\r\nThe EcalTPG_TPMode_Run2_default_v0 tag  corresponds to the standard Run2 configuration that will be used for back-compability in the new Ecal TPG emulator.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------\r\n[1] https://indico.cern.ch/event/991259/contributions/4257032/attachments/2201014/3722716/21_03_03%20-%20L1%20double%20weight%20CMSSW%20integration.pdf\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 23, "closed_at": "1616996432", "comments": 13, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1616157883", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "db-approved", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "37a6fc0a78ef2aeae128d5a4b1b82d7c5fe836ab", "merged_at": "1616996432", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 33220, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Conditions classes for Ecal Trigger double weights mechanism", "updated_at": "1616996433", "user": "valsdav"}

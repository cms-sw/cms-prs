We enable running on MiniAOD. We switched to the threadsafe version of the JetCorrector. \nIn addition we changed the structure of our monitoring plots. We have two categories of plots: \nan uncleaned category: here we don't filter by DCS flags and primary vertex cuts, no JetID is applied -> not to hide problems due to these cuts\na cleaned category: here we apply DCS flags, primary vertex cuts and JetID cuts.\n\nwe removed the uncleaned category for CaloMET and CaloJets\nwe added the cleaned category plots for type 1 corrected MET and charged hadron subtracted jets (to have a 1 to 1 comparison vs collections inside MiniAOD.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 19, "closed_at": "1422619645", "comments": 31, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1418206256", "deletions": 1856, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "8373f8f95c964bd7b6e6bf5aa1a03099a1a81c1a", "merged_at": "1422619645", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 6859, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "update JetMET DQM to enable MiniAOD running, introduce PFCandidate maps ...", "updated_at": "1422619645", "user": "webermat"}

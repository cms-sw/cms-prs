All the gory details are\ndiscussed in PR #5151 .\n\nThis PR here affects only those configurations where the py file does not\ncontain the new parameters added with #5151. Hence RECO, which uses\nthe (updated) cfi file of the module, will continue to use the new non-legacy\nerrors. But at HLT, where the menu is kept in ConfDb based on a 71X template,\nwe do not want any non-reproducability.\n\n[Of course, the non-reproducabilit may actually be elsewhere, as\npointed out by Vincenzo, but the bottom line is that for HLT we want\nrevert until the issue is fixed]\n\nI should add that we (TSG) want this PR even independently of the reproducability\nissue: all new code should be configured to reproduce the old behaviour on unchanged\npy config files.!\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_2_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1410626416", "comments": 14, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1410580524", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_2_X", "number": 5286, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix/mask default behaviour/reproducability issue in StripCPEfromTrackAngle", "updated_at": "1410750011", "user": "Martin-Grunewald"}

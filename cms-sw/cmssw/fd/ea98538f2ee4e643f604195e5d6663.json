PLT, BCM, BHM detectors should be a part of the Run3 scenario and BSC has been decommissioned after Run1. The RUn3 scenario needs changes. The xml files for PLT, BCM need some changes to be included in the Run3 scenario. Before modifying the Run3 scenario, the changes needed in these XML files are tested with overlap checks. These changes along with the demonstration chambers for GE21 and RPC will be included in the new Run3 geometry description.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nChecked with the overlap checking tool within Geometry/MuonCommonData/test/python\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nNothing special.

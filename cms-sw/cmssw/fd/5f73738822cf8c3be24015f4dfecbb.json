The full list of PRs that are included here can be found in https://github.com/SegmentLinking/cmssw/issues/117. This is our first step in our list of follow-up tasks (https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/46746).\r\n\r\nThe changes include bug fixes and algorithmic improvements, but they also start to address follow-up comments from the integration PR. Here are some highlights.\r\n\r\n- Improved support of minimal pt for track reconstruction (expanding also to 0.6 GeV) and made it configurable at runtime (addressing https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/45117#discussion_r1749245650).\r\n- Several updates to T5 DNN selection now replacing most of the algorithmic/rectangular cuts including Jupyter notebooks for documentation.\r\n- Helix-based chi2 in rz improvement for pT5 and introduction for T3 objects.\r\n- Other improvements and fixes, including developments in the standalone code.\r\n- Addressed some follow-up comments from the integration PR (https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/45117#discussion_r1681737544, https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/45117#discussion_r1681741075, first bullet point of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/45117#issuecomment-2479912047)\r\n\r\nMost of these were described in [TRK POG presentation on Sep 9](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1443183/#49-line-segment-tracking-statu)\r\n\r\nHere is a plot showing the impact from these changes on the performance.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/537d9781-d7da-43e5-9ae2-a9d811fc669a)\r\n\r\n\r\n@slava77 @VourMa", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 35, "comments": 6, "commits": 13, "created_at": "1733257433", "deletions": 2616, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved", "tracking"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_0_X", "number": 46857, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "LST algorithm developments accumulated during integration PR", "updated_at": "1733265981", "user": "ariostas"}

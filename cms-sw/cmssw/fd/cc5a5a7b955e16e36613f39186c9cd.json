The (quite convoluted) logic of the L1TPhase2MuonOffline class does require that a (generated muon, l1t muon) pair is created even if there is not a l1t muon. I restore here that feature as it was in origin, still maintaining all the other code improvements implemented in #39283\r\n\r\nAlso this PR **will not** fix the non reproducibility issue observed in DQM for the Phase2 L1T muon efficiency plots. Such a fix will require a more detailed check and debug, made this time not by the release manager but by the @cms-sw/dqm-l2 experts.\r\n\r\nBy the way: who's filling the\r\nL1T__L1TPhase2_Muons_TkMuon_efficiencies_globalEfficiencies\r\nL1T__L1TPhase2_Muons_SAMuon_efficiencies_globalEfficiencies\r\nhistos? I supposed it was the L1TPhase2MuonOffline class that I was trying to fix, but I start to doubt it... That class fills the differential efficiencies, instead. Perhaps some harvester called after it? \r\n\r\nCould some @cms-sw/dqm-l2 and/or @cms-sw/l1-l2 experts investigate, and at least identify who's filling the non reproducible histo?\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nIt builds", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 6, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1662188209", "deletions": 16, "labels": ["l1-pending", "dqm-approved", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_6_X", "number": 39297, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Revert the requirement of having an associated L1T muon in L1TPhase2MuonOffline::matchMuonsToGen", "updated_at": "1662333317", "user": "perrotta"}

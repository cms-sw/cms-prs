The packer changes were tested by unpacking its output and comparing the digis to the original collections, taking into account the expected differences (see [this config](https://github.com/pieterdavid/SiStripLocalRecoDebugging/blob/master/test/testPacker_fromVR.py) and related code).\r\n\r\nwith @alesaggio \r\nCC: @OlivierBondu @vidalm  @mmusich @echabert ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 21, "comments": 34, "commits": 19, "created_at": "1527853352", "deletions": 245, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 23417, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 6, "state": "open", "title": "SiStrip (un)packer: fixes and support for nonstandard ZS(lite) modes", "updated_at": "1528365690", "user": "pieterdavid"}

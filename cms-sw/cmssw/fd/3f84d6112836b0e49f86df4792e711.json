The packer changes were tested by unpacking its output and comparing the digis to the original collections, taking into account the expected differences (see [this config](https://github.com/pieterdavid/SiStripLocalRecoDebugging/blob/master/test/testPacker_fromVR.py) and related code).\r\n\r\nwith @alesaggio \r\nCC: @OlivierBondu @vidalm  @mmusich @echabert ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 24, "closed_at": "1529345542", "comments": 73, "commits": 21, "created_at": "1527853352", "deletions": 252, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "operations-approved", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "b9b3b7d2d164ef1adb5883e42a986463ed2e72dd", "merged_at": "1529345542", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 23417, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 9, "state": "closed", "title": "SiStrip (un)packer: fixes and support for nonstandard ZS(lite) modes", "updated_at": "1529345542", "user": "pieterdavid"}

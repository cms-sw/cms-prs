It allows the sigmaiEtaiEta variable using 5x5 no fractions using the new LazyClusterTools to be available at the HLT. It changes nothing to the user, just adds another variable which is available if the user needs it. Tested on a limited HLT menu to exercise this module in pre7. This would be aiming for pre8.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1399953310", "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1399914522", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "hlt-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "d5943cbe61c45d6b71bda3a5f1019aae025d268e", "merged_at": "1399953310", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_1_0_pre8", "number": 3834, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "modifiying EgammaHLTClusterShapeProducer to also make sigmaIEtaIEta 5x5", "updated_at": "1415552865", "user": "Sam-Harper"}

The standard customisation for HI to change the name of the RAW-data input collection thus has to be disabled (it is commented out, not removed). Whenever new HI collisions data becomes available, the inputs for the relevant `HIon` tests will have to be updated accordingly, as well as the value of `run3_data_HIon` in `autoCondHLT`.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTSG tests (including `runAll.csh dev` and `addOnTests.py`).\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nN/A", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1637786618", "comments": 23, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1637677212", "deletions": 35, "labels": ["hlt-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "6d262f08715b8d6401172284c240fdc354bb6d80", "merged_at": "1637786618", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_2_X", "number": 36222, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "update HLT `addOnTests` for Run-3 Data with 2021 pilot-beam data", "updated_at": "1637786618", "user": "missirol"}

The standard customisation for HI to change the name of the RAW-data input collection thus has to be disabled (it is commented out, not removed). Whenever new HI collisions data becomes available, the inputs for the relevant `HIon` tests will have to be updated accordingly, as well as the value of `run3_data_HIon` in `autoCondHLT`.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTSG tests (including `runAll.csh dev` and `addOnTests.py`).\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nN/A", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1637677212", "deletions": 34, "labels": ["hlt-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_2_X", "number": 36222, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "open", "title": "update HLT `addOnTests` for Run-3 Data with 2021 pilot-beam data", "updated_at": "1637682806", "user": "missirol"}

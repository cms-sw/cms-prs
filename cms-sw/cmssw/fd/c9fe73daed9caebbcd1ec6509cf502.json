(Old config would lead to decay products being excluded or not depending on generator and event properties.)\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_3_X", "changed_files": 13, "closed_at": "1412309420", "comments": 36, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1412029915", "deletions": 23, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "generators-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "0c0eb8897d638a726e383f434579ffb80bbb218f", "merged_at": "1412309420", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_3_X", "number": 5616, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 8, "state": "closed", "title": "Add Updated Cross Section printout to default sequence, and update GenParticle selection for GenJets", "updated_at": "1412309420", "user": "bendavid"}

Currently this process has a relatively large overhead (about 20 minutes) since it re-performs the Madgraph phase space integration every time - the addition of a gridpack system so that this does not need to be done is a high-priority item.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nHave tested that the new relval runs in CMSSW_12_4_X\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

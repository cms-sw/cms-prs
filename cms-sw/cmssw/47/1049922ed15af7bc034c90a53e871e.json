Now in both cases we explicitly set what data we want or if we should ignore the data for this job.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1474030122", "comments": 10, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1473616216", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "43dfd1b14bed7dae04e351326c0846ae44be3bdb", "merged_at": "1474030122", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 15809, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 7, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix DQM use of TriggerResults", "updated_at": "1474291824", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

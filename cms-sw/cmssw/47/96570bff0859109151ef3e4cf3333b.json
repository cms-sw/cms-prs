This did not impact any calculations done with the dressed lepton as a whole.\r\n* Added ghost tau ancestors to identify electrons/muons from tau decays.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested on ttbar sample, number of dressed lepton constituents has entries >1 as expected again. Tau ghosts increase number of constituents and show up in the `tags` collection.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1556970033", "comments": 11, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1556892822", "deletions": 12, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "generators-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "b990340070cef02a67eafe22596b20e366684d6e", "merged_at": "1556970033", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 26616, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix dressed lepton constituents, add tau ghosts", "updated_at": "1556970033", "user": "intrepid42"}

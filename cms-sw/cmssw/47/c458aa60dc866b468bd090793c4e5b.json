Its primary use case is to remake the pre-splitting SiPixelClusters from the split ones to allow re-running of the tracking sequence from the RECO data tier.\r\n\r\nThis PR slightly modifies the SiPixelCluster DataFormat code but without changing the format version. The only effect will be a slight increase in the size of the `siPixelClusters` collection. All other objects downstream from the pixel clusters should remain unchanged.\r\n\r\nMore details can be found in the following slides presented in the Pixel Offline meeting https://indico.cern.ch/event/536890/contributions/2361054/attachments/1365112/2067644/Proposed_SiPixelCluster_changes.pdf\r\n\r\n**Update (Nov. 7, 2016):** Rebased to CMSSW_8_1_X_2016-11-07-1100", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 8, "closed_at": "1480227756", "comments": 61, "commits": 10, "created_at": "1477873645", "deletions": 113, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "892d9076ac6f7d78a09131023743f02860bd6390", "merged_at": "1480227756", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 16393, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "Reclustering of SiPixelClusters", "updated_at": "1480449510", "user": "ferencek"}

This is possible because we're actually saving the `hltOnlineMetaDataDigis` to `DQMOnlineScouting` stream (see also [CMSHLT-3585](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSHLT-3585)).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n`scram b runtests_TestDQMOnlineClient-scouting_dqm_sourceclient` runs fine and without warnings.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

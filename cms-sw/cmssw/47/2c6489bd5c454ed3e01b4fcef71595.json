The thread safety issues are fixed by removing the 'static' calls in `PtAssignmentEngineDxy`.\r\n\r\nThis PR updates EMTF emulator by adding a new class (`PtAssignmentEngineDxy`) that handles vertex unconstrained pT and Dxy assignment. The changes should not affect anything for prompt muons. The main changes are:\r\n\r\n- Added `PtAssignmentEngineDxy` and necessary changes to the EMTF algorithm to support it.\r\n- Added setters and getters for vertex unconstrained pT and Dxy to `EMTFTrack`\r\n\r\n\r\nThe backport of this PR to 11_2_X (#32642 ) is already updated/\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with a description of the feature proposed or problem addressed, specifying:\r\n  - what changes are expected in the output if any, \r\n  - what other PRs or externals it depends upon if any,\r\n  - link to any additional material useful to provide a documentation for this PR (slides, JIRA tickets, related pull requestes, hypernews, TWiki or Indico pages)  -->\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with a description of which tests have been performed to verify the correctness of the PR, including the eventual addition of new code for testing like unit tests, test configurations, additions or updates to the runTheMatrix test workflows -->\r\n\r\nValidated with:\r\n\r\n- scram b runtests\r\n- runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos\r\n\r\nNotifications: @jiafulow", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 16, "closed_at": "1613028657", "comments": 13, "commits": 9, "created_at": "1612435073", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "requires-external", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "f08df552b6350a628ff3ce940ef167cd6dbffb6c", "merged_at": "1613028657", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 32813, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "EMTF Emulator Update to Add Displaced Muon pT & Dxy Assignment", "updated_at": "1613028657", "user": "eyigitba"}

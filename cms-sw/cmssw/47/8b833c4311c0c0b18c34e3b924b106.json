This additional contribution to track time uncertainty is now:\r\n * included in the calculation for the MTD hit-to-track matching $\\chi^2_t$ in `TrackExtenderWithMTD`;\r\n * has been included in the`VertexTimeAlgorithmFromTracksPID` vertex time algorithm for the 3D+t step, which now uses a different track time uncertainty for each mass hypothesis;\r\n * has been added to the total track time uncertainty in `TOFPIDProducer` (used in the 4D vertex reconstruction step through `DAClusterizerInZT` and `VertexTimeAlgorithmLegacy4D`).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, an improved definition of vertex time uncertainty has been introduced in both `VertexTimeAlgorithmFromTracksPID` and `VertexTimeAlgorithmLegacy4D`.\r\nAll the mentioned modifications have been discussed and presented in MTD DPG meetings ([1](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1390639/contributions/5846173/attachments/2816111/4916250/MTDDPG_080324_palmeri.pdf), [2](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1395368/contributions/5866090/attachments/2825647/4935848/MTDDPG_220324_palmeri.pdf)).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe PR has been validated on TTbar14TeV and TTbar14TeV+PU200 samples, producing results documented in the two aforementioned presentations.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "comments": 13, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1711558741", "deletions": 37, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-rejected", "tracking", "mtd"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 44562, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "open", "title": "MTD reconstruction: propagation of track time of flight uncertainty to vertex reconstruction", "updated_at": "1712584059", "user": "noepalm"}

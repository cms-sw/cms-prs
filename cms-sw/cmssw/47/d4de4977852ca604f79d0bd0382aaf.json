The std::string can be constructor by both of them\r\nthus causing compiler to error on it.\r\n\r\nUse static_cast to explicitly select conversion operator which would be\r\ncompatible with previous C++ standards.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: David Abdurachmanov <David.Abdurachmanov@cern.ch>", "branch": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1484930692", "comments": 6, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1484915907", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "3edc2e2c6269afc80f04daccd7e818e465d44c26", "merged_at": "1484930692", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "number": 17227, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Use static_cast to call explicitly conversion operator on TString", "updated_at": "1484937094", "user": "davidlt"}

Heavy Ions needs this information during the pp reference run in order to do proper comparisons to PbPb results, where this information will be used for photon ID.\n\nIt will add two instances of the HIPhotonIsolation ValueMap, one for \"std\" photons and another for GED photons to the RECO and AOD event content for pp events.\nThis is urgent, as the pp reference run is approaching soon.\n\n@richard-cms\n@yenjie\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 16, "closed_at": "1446144544", "comments": 3, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1446060555", "deletions": 12, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 12155, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add HeavyIon-isolation producer to pp photons - backport of #12152", "updated_at": "1446144544", "user": "ttrk"}

This is currently prevented by a defensive check  that disallows reading products in a release prior to the release in which the product was created.  This pull request adds a configurable option \"bypassVersionCheck\" to bypass this check.  See\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/299538/material/slides/1.pdf\nfor the XEB report in which this commitment is documented.\nThis pull request is for 7_0_X only.  It needs to be customized for other release cycles.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1406036942", "comments": 4, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1405019725", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "3e6a4d9e449caa038221f9e6d1ae13ec2c92c7ed", "merged_at": "1406036942", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_0_X", "number": 4605, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Allow option of reading of files with prior releases (for 7_0_X)", "updated_at": "1408975806", "user": "wmtan"}

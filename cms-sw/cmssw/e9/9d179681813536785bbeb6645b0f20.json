The definitive target is to have the alignments in DB, but we are too late for the deadline of 5 March. We plan to have it done for the re-reco of 2018 data.\r\n\r\nThis PR is built on top of #22264 and thus has the same dependencies, e.g. #22290. Consequently, some tests will necessarily fail before the latter is merged.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 30, "comments": 30, "commits": 27, "created_at": "1520011629", "deletions": 1227, "labels": ["alca-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "geometry-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_1_X", "number": 22433, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "CTPPS: alignment update", "updated_at": "1520553349", "user": "jan-kaspar"}

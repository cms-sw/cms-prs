The definitive target is to have the alignments in DB, but we are too late for the deadline of 5 March. We plan to have it done for the re-reco of 2018 data.\r\n\r\nThis PR is built on top of #22264 and thus has the same dependencies, e.g. #22290. Consequently, some tests will necessarily fail before the latter is merged.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 30, "closed_at": "1521979494", "comments": 43, "commits": 27, "created_at": "1520011629", "deletions": 1227, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "fc18d9405a66f80c9b2cb6a2d11255ecef8a4d07", "merged_at": "1521979494", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_1_X", "number": 22433, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "CTPPS: alignment update", "updated_at": "1521979494", "user": "jan-kaspar"}

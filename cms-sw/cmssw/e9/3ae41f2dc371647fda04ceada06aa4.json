The explicit task_arena allows for the possibility of allowing oversubscribing the number of threads used (helpful for scale testing).\r\n- Removed all direct use of edm::EventProcessor outside of FWCore. This avoids having to deal with restricting the number of threads to use outside of FWCore.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n- all FWCore unit tests pass\r\n- did `runTheMatrix.py -l limited -t 4` and `runTheMatrix.py -l limited -t 1` both of which were successful.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 25, "closed_at": "1599843485", "comments": 36, "commits": 10, "created_at": "1598964655", "deletions": 523, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "core-approved", "db-approved", "l1-pending", "orp-approved", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "753f6f391ab9f69b51be7cb38492f33f1e95f16d", "merged_at": "1599843485", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 31313, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 9, "state": "closed", "title": "Remove use of deprecated tbb::task_scheduler_init from FWCore", "updated_at": "1599843485", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

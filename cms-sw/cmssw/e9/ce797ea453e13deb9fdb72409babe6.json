This PR does not change neither the geometry nor the total material budget. This PR finalizes the material classification performed in the Validation/ package used to produce the material budget plots, and these plots are the only parts affected by this PR. The new plots, produced after the modification included in this PR, have been already approved and made public in CMS DP-2019/006.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe tests recommended in the PRWorkflow page have been run successfully, including runTheMatrix.py.\r\n\r\n#### PR documentation\r\n\r\nThe presentations to the Tracker DPG group supporting this PR can be found here:\r\n\r\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/787556/contributions/3273998/attachments/1779074/2893599/190115_Zucchetta.pdf\r\n\r\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/787654/contributions/3298227/attachments/1786961/2909823/190129_Zucchetta.pdf", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1556221875", "comments": 22, "commits": 8, "created_at": "1556042548", "deletions": 31, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "a9ec3bd0225d24888b2b4dc75b6a6966edc5a2ee", "merged_at": "1556221875", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 26516, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "Pixel Phase-1 material budget classification", "updated_at": "1556221876", "user": "zucchett"}

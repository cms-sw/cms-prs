The point is to make all other components than the hit ntuplet generation to support `fillDescriptions()`. This is achieved by making fitters and filters EDProducts (because at least one of the algorithms depend on event data) and making cleaners ESProducts (because none of the cleaners need event data).\r\n\r\nI have tried to migrate all uses in CMSSW, but I can't exclude of missing something.\r\n\r\nThe next step is to migrate `PixelTrackProducer` to the new seeding framework (#16635), and fully migrate HLT (with `customizeHLTforCMSSW.py`).\r\n\r\nTested in CMSSW_9_0_X_2016-11-27-2300 (rebased on top of CMSSW_9_0_X_2016-12-04-2300), no changes expected.\r\n\r\n@rovere @VinInn @felicepantaleo @mtosi @JanFSchulte ", "branch": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "changed_files": 96, "closed_at": "1481787927", "comments": 60, "commits": 12, "created_at": "1480424511", "deletions": 1061, "labels": ["alca-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-pending", "fastsim-pending", "hlt-approved", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "3d6acdd5a5ef1d11a6b4810fc2c02d3fd77df53c", "merged_at": "1481787927", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "number": 16792, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "Transform pixel track fitter, filter, and cleaner to ED or ES products", "updated_at": "1481795769", "user": "makortel"}

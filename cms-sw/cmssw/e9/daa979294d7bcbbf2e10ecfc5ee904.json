The MeVtoMIP conversion value to be used for the new 2-discs ETL geometry validation has been fixed to the correct value of 0.015. \r\n\r\n2. The filling of the occupancy plots has been modified, introducing a negative weight to discriminate between the two sides of each ETL disc. \r\n\r\n3. The MTDGlobalReco plugins have been corrected, merging the two separate histograms used in the evaluation of the efficiencies, one for each of the two ETL discs, into a single one. This has been done since the efficiency is evaluated as:\r\nTracks with an associated deposit in negative (positive) side of ETL MTD/ All tracks with -3.2 <  < -1.5 (1.5 <  < 3.2),\r\nwhere the numerator does not discriminate between tracks with an associated hit in the first or second ETL disc.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nThe new code has been tested in the release CMSSW_11_2_0_pre10\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": "1608161744", "comments": 18, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1607955421", "deletions": 264, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "284a1888227321c3c766e91284c309abafd415df", "merged_at": "1608161744", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 32476, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "ETL Validation code update and fixes", "updated_at": "1608161744", "user": "gsorrentino18"}

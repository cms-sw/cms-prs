It was checked that all newly added dependencies are actually required by the package with `git grep`.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 81, "closed_at": "1601020961", "comments": 17, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1600810949", "deletions": 362, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "96b916cd872b5dde09118fb9f965c0fb92b2f4b0", "merged_at": "1601020961", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 31548, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Clean BuildFiles in L1Trigger", "updated_at": "1601020962", "user": "guitargeek"}

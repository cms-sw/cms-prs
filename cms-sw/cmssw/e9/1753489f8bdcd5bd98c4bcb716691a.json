This implies that the frontier connection string does not contain anymore the proxy and server URLs, as well as any further connection configuration parameters;\r\n* a new frontier production servlet, pointing to the online production Database, namely `FrontierProd`. As a consequence, the online connection string will be exactly the same as the one used at any other computing tiers. The production string, as defined in `CondCore/ESSources/python/CondDBESSource_cfi.py`, becomes then the unique entry point for any condition retrieval in the framework: the site where the CMSSW jobs runs is responsible for configuring the frontier condition access in the site local config.\r\n\r\n@fwyzard this is something you might want to watch as well.", "branch": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1481796941", "comments": 14, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1481391919", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-pending", "hold", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "number": 16964, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Drop the customisation of the GT connection string for online DQM.", "updated_at": "1486108263", "user": "diguida"}

These plots help to understand and monitor the association of tracks to the PV.\n\nIn order to make the \"efficiency/rates vs. cut on dz(PV)\" plots, I moved the normalization and cumulation in DQMGenericClient to be done before efficiency calculation. This change has no effect on the current users of the cumulation feature.\n\nTested in CMSSW_7_6_X_2015-07-25-2300, no changes expected in existing histograms.\n\n@rovere @VinInn \n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 13, "closed_at": "1439230028", "comments": 11, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1438240594", "deletions": 32, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "093623ee736aeca7c643c72dd8301ed97f6608c3", "merged_at": "1439230028", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 10472, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add efficiency and fake rate vs. dxy/dz wrt PV to MultiTrackValidator, and make normalization+cumulative histograms before efficiency in DQMGenericClient", "updated_at": "1476956821", "user": "makortel"}

In this PR:\r\n- the scripts in plotdata/ are removed, since these are now maintained independently by the lumi POG (<https://github.com/CMS-LUMI-POG/PublicPlots>)\r\n- all of the unused scripts (which is nearly all of them) are removed\r\n- split the constants used in lumiQueryAPI.py into their own file so those can be saved\r\n- estimatePileup_makeJSON_2015.py has been extensively rewritten, since there was a lot of dead or otherwise not useful code, and renamed to makePileupJSON.py, since it's not 2015 any more!)\r\n- pileupCalc.py has been slightly modified (mostly just giving more helpful informational and warning messages, and more sensible defaults for Run 2)\r\n- the other few items are kept unchanged\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI've run through the normal process of generating a pileup histogram (brilcalc -> makePileupJSON.py -> pileupCalc.py) and verified that the resulting histogram is exactly the same. Also checked to make sure that nothing outside RecoLuminosity/LumiDB depends on any of these modules.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 143, "closed_at": "1561444835", "comments": 20, "commits": 14, "created_at": "1561032969", "deletions": 75187, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "db-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "01b3cc9300b7b0485aeb5e8297f62cedd9621024", "merged_at": "1561444835", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27289, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Cleanup of RecoLuminosity/LumiDB", "updated_at": "1561444835", "user": "plujan"}

The 'generic reco only' configuration of the T22 geoemtry is turned off as well now that the necessary payloads exist. \r\n\r\nThe performance of these new payloads in local reconstruction were tested and look good.\r\n\r\nTracking validation was also run with the new changes using 100 TTbar events without pileup for both the T21 and T22 geometries (workflows 29034 and 29434). They show only minor differences as expected. \r\n\r\nThese tests are summarized in slides [here](https://indico.cern.ch/event/934808/contributions/3996590/attachments/2094091/3519320/phase2_dual_slope_payloads_and_testing.pdf). \r\n\r\n@mmusich @tsusa @emiglior @cmantill @mtosi @tvami @pmaksim1 @JanFSchulte @jalimena @perrotta @slava77 ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1599194582", "comments": 47, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1598454413", "deletions": 14, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "pdmv-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "c549a844d0021f93635383cc7571a425d8f28b10", "merged_at": "1599194582", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 31253, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 9, "state": "closed", "title": "Turn on dual slope ToT in phase-2 pixels digitizer and clusterizer and update CPE payloads to match", "updated_at": "1599194583", "user": "OzAmram"}

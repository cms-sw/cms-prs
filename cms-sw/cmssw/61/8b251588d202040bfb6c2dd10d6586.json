After setting up the communication with an `MPISource`, it transmits to it all EDM run, lumi and event transitions, and instructs the `MPISource` to replicate them in the second process.\r\n\r\nThe `MPISource` is a `Source` controlling the execution of a second CMSSW process. After setting up the communication with an `MPIController`, it listens for EDM run, lumi and event transitions, and replicates them in its process.\r\n\r\nBoth `MPIController` and `MPISource` produce an `MPIToken`, a special data product that encapsulates the information about the MPI communication channel.\r\n\r\nThe `MPISender` is an `EDProducer` that can read one or more collections from the Event, serialise them using their ROOT dictionaries, and send them over the MPI communication channel.\r\n\r\nThe `MPIReceiver` is an `EDProducer` that can receive a set number of collections over the MPI communication channel, deserialise them using their ROOT dictionaries, and put them in the Event with a configurable instance label.\r\n\r\nIn principle any non-transient collection with a ROOT dictionary can be transmitted. Any transient information is lost during the transfer, and needs to be recreated by the receiving side.\r\n\r\nEach `MPISender` and `MPIReceiver` is configured with an instance value that is used to match one `MPISender` in one process to one `MPIReceiver` in another process. Using different instance values allows the use of multiple `MPISenders`/`MPIReceivers` in a process.\r\n\r\nBoth `MPISender` and `MPIReceiver` obtain the MPI communication channel reading an `MPIToken` from the event. They also produce a copy of the `MPIToken`, so other modules can consume it to declare a dependency on the previous modules.\r\n\r\nAn automated test is available in the `test/` directory.\r\n\r\n#### Current limitations\r\n  - all communication is blocking, and there is no acknowledgment or feedback from one module to the other;\r\n  - `MPIDriver` is a \"one\" module that supports only a single luminosity block at a time;\r\n  - ~~`MPISender` and `MPIReceiver` support a single compile-time type;~~\r\n  - there is no check that the type sent by the `MPISender` matches the type expected by the `MPIReceiver`.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Expected future developments\r\n  - implement efficient serialisation for standard layout types;\r\n  - implement efficient serialisation for `PortableCollection` types;\r\n  - check the the collection sent by the `MPISender` and the one expected by the `MPIReceiver` match;\r\n  - ~~extend the `MPISender` and `MPIReceiver` to send and receive multiple collections;~~\r\n  - ~~rewrite the `MPISender` and `MPIReceiver` to send and receive arbitrary run-time collections;~~\r\n  - improve the `MPIController` to be a `global` module rather than a `one` module;\r\n  - let an `MPISource` accept connections and events from multiple `MPIController` modules in different jobs;\r\n  - let an `MPIController` connect and sent events to multiple `MPISource` modules in different jobs;\r\n  - support multiple concurrent runs and luminosity blocks, up to a given maximum;\r\n  - transfer the `ProcessingHistory` from the `MPIController` to the `MPISource` ? and vice-versa ?\r\n  - transfer other provenance information from the `MPIController` to the `MPISource` ? and vice-versa ?\r\n  - when a run, luminosity block or event is received, check that they belong to the same `ProcessingHistory` as the ongoing run ?\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis PR includes an automated unit test.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 41, "comments": 166, "commits": 13, "created_at": "1610412286", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["core-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-rejected", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "heterogeneous-pending", "changes-dataformats", "ngt"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 32632, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 9, "state": "open", "title": "Extend CMSSW to a distributed application over MPI", "updated_at": "1757480078", "user": "fwyzard"}

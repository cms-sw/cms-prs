The affect is shown in average charge difference between RAW and RAW' dataset.\r\n\r\n- The bug fixes as Int avgCharge - (cluster.charge()+cluster.size()/2)/cluster.size()\r\n\r\n- Details can found[ here slide 4](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1505968/contributions/6362526/attachments/3009026/5310942/TrackDPG_v2.pdf)\r\n\r\n##### Compression of barycenter\r\n\r\n- Instead of storing barycenter to 16 bit Int , choose the float variable and compress the variable using std::round(cluster.barycenter() * bit_range / maxBarycenter)\r\n\r\n- _bit_range_ is the range of each bit value, e.g. bit range for 16 bit is 2^16 - 1 = 65535.\r\n\r\n- _maxBarycenter_ is the maximum value of barycenter which found that is 770.0.\r\n\r\n- Details can found [here slide 9](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1421629/contributions/6136900/attachments/2975519/5237807/NGT%20-%20Task%203.3%20-%201st%20NGT%20technical%20workshop.pdf)\r\n\r\n##### Changing the configuration\r\n\r\n- The  `Configuration.Eras.Era_Run2024_approxSiStripCluster` is the configuration use for run approximate cluster collection in the **RECO** step.

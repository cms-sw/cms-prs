While trying to make tracker-driven seeds of low pt electrons, we loop over endcap tracks also, which is necessary for Phase1 but can be omitted in Phase2, because the code is setup for ECAL/HCAL only. \r\n\r\nThis is just to speed up the Phase2 reco, and is an attempt to follow up on this issue: https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/40231\r\n\r\nThere should be no physics change. But, in barrel/endcap transition region, some differences may show up for edge cases where the electron was in endcap tracker initially, but after a brem it bent towards barrel and the energy deposit is recorded in ECAL barrel. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nWorkflow `21034.21` runs fine.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1673636523", "comments": 14, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1670182727", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-approved", "egamma"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "number": 40237, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Low pt electron seeding: optimisation for phase2", "updated_at": "1673636523", "user": "swagata87"}

The following line is removed from this PR,\r\n`trackerGeometry.applyAlignment = cms.bool(False)`\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nThe private sample has been done. The result shows in slide 6 and 7 of\r\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/992973/#6-validation-results\r\nThe agreement between DDD-DB / DD4hep-XML is seen.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\nThis is not a backport. It is unclear if we should backport for 12_0. To be discussed.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 13, "closed_at": "1630467830", "comments": 14, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1630419468", "deletions": 20, "labels": ["geometry-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "upgrade-approved", "code-checks-approved", "trk-dpg-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "aa29168a9c2c04aeeb3c5875a41d270d316588ad", "merged_at": "1630467830", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "number": 35092, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix 2021 Reco Geometry Config files", "updated_at": "1630485449", "user": "srimanob"}

The fixed version (green) agrees with the default positive/negative ratio (red).\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1311783/54034872-4772bb00-41b8-11e9-9856-159fa712b516.png)\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 3, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1552052659", "deletions": 8, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "generators-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 26111, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Fix Rivet weights", "updated_at": "1552053224", "user": "intrepid42"}

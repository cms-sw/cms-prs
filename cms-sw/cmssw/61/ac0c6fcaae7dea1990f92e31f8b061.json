The fixed version (green) agrees with the default positive/negative ratio (red).\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1311783/54034872-4772bb00-41b8-11e9-9856-159fa712b516.png)\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1552164809", "comments": 11, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1552052659", "deletions": 8, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "generators-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "6251504a61084928ac8d231579a2a8c4f571f0c8", "merged_at": "1552164809", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 26111, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix Rivet weights", "updated_at": "1552164809", "user": "intrepid42"}

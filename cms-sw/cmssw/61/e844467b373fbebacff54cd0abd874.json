Before, the number of rings in the OT was fixed to 15, now the size can change between rings. Moreover, this PR also fix the Navigation School in this layout: the logic in the forward layers ordering was not suitable anymore. A fast fix has been applied, but it can also be modify with something better when the reconstruction and the layout will be definitive.\r\nThe new navigation map can be found [d4.pdf](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/files/528076/d4.pdf) and it does appear as it should. In order to produce it by yourself, the following analyzer can be used: `RecoTracker/TkNavigation/test/NavigationSchoolAnalyzer_cfg.py`.\r\n\r\nThe others geometry should stay unchanged. In order to facilitate the comparison, I have already produced the MTV results with ttbar sample for [run2](http://ebrondol.web.cern.ch/ebrondol/Phase2Tracking/PR16207/20161013_Run2_phase2_fixNavigation/), [phase 1](http://ebrondol.web.cern.ch/ebrondol/Phase2Tracking/PR16207/20161013_Phase1_phase2_fixNavigation/) and [phase 2 - D1 geometry](http://ebrondol.web.cern.ch/ebrondol/Phase2Tracking/PR16207/20161013_Phase2D1_phase2_fixNavigation/).\r\n\r\nMore fixes are needed in order to get the new phase2 geometry ready for performance, but with this PR it should be possible to create the entire D4 WF running (@boudoul). So, please consider this PR as urgent. Thanks.\r\n\r\n@kpedro88  @makortel @atricomi @venturia \r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1477368958", "comments": 31, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1476382362", "deletions": 32, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved", "urgent"], "merge_commit_sha": "782094659c702807c9f27a1c5678298cf23c5399", "merged_at": "1477368958", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 16207, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "Phase2 OT Rings and Navigation fixed for tk geometry v4021", "updated_at": "1478078718", "user": "ebrondol"}

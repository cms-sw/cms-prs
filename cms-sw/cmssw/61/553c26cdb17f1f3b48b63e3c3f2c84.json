It's not critical for data taking, but it will be good to backport it so we can improve monitoring of this trigger for 2023.\r\n\r\nThe changes are as follows:\r\n\r\n- Changed the internal name of the trigger from HMT to \"muon shower\" or \"MUS\". This is done for consistency with other L1T trigger producers\r\n- Added a proper way of creating `CSCShowerDigi` in EMTF unpacker. This was mostly done to adjust the `BX` value associated with the shower (but also follows the same pattern with other EMTF inputs)\r\n- Added support for new loose shower bit in unpacked EMTF outputs\r\n- Removed pure muon shower objects from EMTF hit and track collections. This should fix the unnecessary LogWarning messages originating from EMTF unpacker or emulator\r\n\r\nThere will be a PR to include the BX value in EMTF emulator (and potentially uGMT as well) in the future, but for now I wanted to keep these separate.\r\n\r\nThis PR will be backported to 13_0_X and 13_1_X.   \r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with a description of the feature proposed or problem addressed, specifying:\r\n  - what changes are expected in the output if any, \r\n  - what other PRs or externals it depends upon if any,\r\n  - link to any additional material useful to provide a documentation for this PR (slides, JIRA tickets, related pull requestes, hypernews, TWiki or Indico pages)  -->\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nValidated by `runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos` as well as unpacking a recent run and validating that the correct shower bits are being unpacked at each stage.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with a description of which tests have been performed to verify the correctness of the PR, including the eventual addition of new code for testing like unit tests, test configurations, additions or updates to the runTheMatrix test workflows -->\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

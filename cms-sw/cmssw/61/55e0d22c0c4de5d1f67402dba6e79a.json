In this PR following modifications proposed:\r\n1) gamma general process enabled\r\n2) CMSTDormandPrince45 stepper in magnetic field is used (reduced number of calls to the sqrt with the same argument)\r\n3) Tracking cut for charged particles increased from 1 keV to 25 keV, which is below lowest production threshold for delta-electrons\r\n\r\nThese modifications change simulation histories, so the regression is not expected. CPU should be improved (~5% for ttbar). \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nthere was PdmV campaign to check the general gamma process, which was approved. Other modifications were validated privately\r\n\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

In this PR following modifications proposed:\r\n1) gamma general process enabled\r\n2) CMSTDormandPrince45 stepper in magnetic field is used (reduced number of calls to sqrt)\r\n3) MaximumEpsilonStep reduced from 0.01 to 0.001 (Geant4 recommendation)\r\n4) Tracking cut increased from 1 keV to 25 keV\r\n\r\nThese modifications change simulation histories, so the regression is not expected. CPU should be improved. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nthere was PdmV campaign to check the general gamma process, which was approved. Other modifications were validated privately\r\n\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

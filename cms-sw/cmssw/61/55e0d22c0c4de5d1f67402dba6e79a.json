In this PR following modifications proposed:\r\n1) gamma general process enabled\r\n2) CMSTDormandPrince45 stepper in magnetic field is used (reduced number of calls to sqrt)\r\n3) Tracking cut increased from 1 keV to 25 keV\r\n\r\nThese modifications change simulation histories, so the regression is not expected. CPU should be improved (~5% for ttbar). \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nthere was PdmV campaign to check the general gamma process, which was approved. Other modifications were validated privately\r\n\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for: NO\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 8, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1661851494", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["simulation-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_6_X", "number": 39249, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Advanced configuration of Geant4 simulation", "updated_at": "1662045027", "user": "civanch"}

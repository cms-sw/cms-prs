In doing so I've rearranged the era configuration slightly to make it a little more modular.  Files import one new cff file, all of the commands in which are conditional on the stage1L1Trigger era being active.  Hence it is always safe to import whether the Stage 1 trigger is being used or not.  This simplifies the higher level config files, and should hopefully make them more intuitive.\n\nIf trigger experts have suggestions of a better arrangement please feel free to comment.\n\nI've run diffs of the config files for the following workflows, and there are no differences:\n\n```\n1000.0,1001.0,1003.0,101.0,1306.0,1306.0,1330.0,135.1,135.4,140.53,25.0,25.0,250203.0,25202.0,25203.0,4.22,4.52,4.53,5.1,500203.0,50202.0,50203.0,8.0,9.0\n```\n\n@Martin-Grunewald - Once this is merged the AddOn tests will work with eras (I've checked) and I'll reopen #11690.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1444968029", "comments": 6, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1444907685", "deletions": 33, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fastsim-pending", "l1-approved", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "017ee9664be2dd04e47a484e0e1533f81302f594", "merged_at": "1444968029", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 11817, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Make the L1REPACK step work with the Run 2 eras", "updated_at": "1444972842", "user": "mark-grimes"}

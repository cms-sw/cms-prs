Since HLT\r\nprovides no digis, only dqmBeamMonitor runs. The client is a much slimmed-down\r\nversion of the original beam_dqm_sourceclient-live_cfg.py.\r\n\r\nThere is a new DQM folder called BeaMonitorHLT, the client outputs folders Fit\r\nand PrimaryVertex.\r\n\r\nThe client was tested on run several runs for proper functioning and timing\r\n(4-5 per fits at the end of blocks with 10 LSs).\r\n\r\nFor further info please check:\r\nhttps://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/OnlineBeamSpot#23_June_2017_check_the_new_DQMOn", "branch": "CMSSW_9_2_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1502344785", "comments": 15, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1501324666", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "0878de5293159082d06183b7f6b56d3e42d85d8c", "merged_at": "1502344785", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_2_X", "number": 19968, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "new beamhlt dqm client", "updated_at": "1502344785", "user": "sikler"}

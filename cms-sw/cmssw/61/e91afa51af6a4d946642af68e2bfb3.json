This completes information needed to build tau quantities based on energy fractions of its constituents. \r\n\r\nThe addition is triggered only for UL re-miniAOD by `run2_miniAOD_UL` modifier.\r\n\r\nSize increase estimated in the original PR with ttbar sample with PU is as follows:\r\n* total size: +0.14% or +107 bytes/event,\r\n* packedPFCandidates: +0.3%.\r\n\r\nThis PR is a partial backport of #30571. Changes other than energy fraction of PFGammas contained in the original PR can be a subject of another backport PR to 10_6_X series, but as they are not affecting event content will be postponed for more peaceful time.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested with standard miniAOD workflow with `run2_miniAOD_UL` modifier.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nIt is a partial backport of #30571, needed for UL re-miniAOD production as agreed with XPOG.\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1606864922", "comments": 10, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1606483799", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "e7a551b649f15a7db4ff1a0980ca9f7b60d4ff34", "merged_at": "1606864922", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 32314, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Store energy fractions of gammas in packedPFCandidates (10_6_X)", "updated_at": "1606864923", "user": "mbluj"}

The plan has been raised in the [2025 Annual Trigger Review](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1597088/contributions/6738695/attachments/3167217/5629246/2025-10-31_2026TriggerReview_HLTScouting.pdf) and discussed in [scouting meeting](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1631078/contributions/6865937/subcontributions/593382/attachments/3215144/5727561/2026ScoutingDQMUpgradePlan.pdf).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Description of the current change\r\n\r\n- Filter-by-filter efficiency monitoring, mainly to provide the hint for origins of observed efficiency difference.\r\n- Update scouting ID, basically removed the isolation cut + some minor optimization of the variables (based on the study of scouting cutbased ID reported in [EGM meeting](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1610914/contributions/6788708/attachments/3178779/5653835/ScoutingElectron%20Cutbased%20ID.pdf)). This change is needed to monitor the J/Psi reconstruction.\r\n- The changes should affect both Online and Offline DQM stream.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with a description of which tests have been performed to verify the correctness of the PR, including the eventual addition of new code for testing like unit tests, test configurations, additions or updates to the runTheMatrix test workflows -->\r\n\r\nThis PR has been prepared from `CMSSW_16_0_0_patch1`\r\n\r\n```\r\nscram project CMSSW_16_0_0_patch1\r\ncd CMSSW_16_0_0_patch1/src\r\ncmsenv\r\ngit cms-rebase-topic --old-base CMSSW_16_1_0_pre1 tihsu99:tihsu_DQM_2026_16_1_X\r\nscram b && scram b code-checks && scram b code-format && scram b\r\n```\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# 2500.3307 ScoutingPFRun3_Run2025C_HLTSCOUT_150X+scoutingNANO_data15.0\r\n# 2500.3308 ScoutingPFMonitor_Run2025C_MINIAOD_150X+scoutingNANO_monitor_data15.0\r\nrunTheMatrix.py -l 2500.3307 # all pass\r\nrunTheMatrix.py -l 2500.3308 # all pass\r\n```\r\n[c.c. @silviodonato @patinkaew ]", "branch": "CMSSW_16_0_X", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 6, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1771452767", "deletions": 279, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "backport-ok"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_0_X", "number": 50183, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[Backport CMSSW_16_0_X] Filter-by-filter monitoring for Scouting-EGM DQM", "updated_at": "1771481243", "user": "tihsu99"}

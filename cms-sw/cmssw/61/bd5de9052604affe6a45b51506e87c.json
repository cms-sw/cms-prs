But 74X is the release used for HLT development, and I'm pushing this PR now just in case someone wants to consider it for a possible 74X patch release meant to test also HLT in the productions with B=0 (see also https://hypernews.cern.ch/HyperNews/CMS/get/physics-validation/2404.html)\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 52, "closed_at": "1432820064", "comments": 38, "commits": 75, "created_at": "1432713079", "deletions": 210779, "labels": ["alca-pending", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "generators-pending", "hlt-approved", "l1-pending", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "dc8d4bbe9b6c47262d2cbcac45ff6e10f413274f", "merged_at": "1432820064", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 9292, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 6, "state": "closed", "title": "HLT updates on top of CMSSW_7_4_3 (incl.

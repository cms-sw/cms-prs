Minor modifications for the data are possible because TDC special codes 58, 59, 60, and 61 were not taken into account in earlier code (these TDC codes are also supposed to be very rare).\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 10, "closed_at": "1500529085", "comments": 53, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1499737838", "deletions": 35, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "d7e7fea1c3248842373c6d2a9a43b45efdb722dc", "merged_at": "1500529084", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_3_X", "number": 19672, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 7, "state": "closed", "title": "Better handling of special TDC values for QIE10/QIE11", "updated_at": "1500600404", "user": "igv4321"}

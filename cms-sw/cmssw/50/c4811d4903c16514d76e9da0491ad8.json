The cache identifier behavior for Events becomes easier to understand when different Principals use different cache identifiers. With a global cache identifier counter e.g. the number of concurrent lumis would impact the first cache identifier value the SleepProducer sees.\r\n\r\nResolves https://github.com/cms-sw/framework-team/issues/1387\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nFramework unit tests pass. A private test with the cache identifier (not included here, but will likely come in a future PR) ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 3, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1746710600", "deletions": 9, "labels": ["core-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 48038, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Use separate cache identifiers for different Principals, and add an option to use the Event cache identifier in SleepProducer", "updated_at": "1746710760", "user": "makortel"}

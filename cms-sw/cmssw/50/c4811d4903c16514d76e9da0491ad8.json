The cache identifier behavior for Events becomes easier to understand when different Principals use different cache identifiers. With a global cache identifier counter e.g. the number of concurrent lumis would impact the first cache identifier value the SleepProducer sees.\r\n\r\nResolves https://github.com/cms-sw/framework-team/issues/1387\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nFramework unit tests pass. A private test with the cache identifier (not included here, but will likely come in a future PR) ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1746760513", "comments": 9, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1746710600", "deletions": 9, "labels": ["core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "a34fb6b60e55a1afffdf6f555d3d0bb553046693", "merged_at": "1746760513", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 48038, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "Use separate cache identifiers for different Principals, and add an option to use the Event cache identifier in SleepProducer", "updated_at": "1746760514", "user": "makortel"}

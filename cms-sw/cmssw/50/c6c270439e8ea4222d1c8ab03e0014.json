It was found that events pass both paths and use the triplet filter in the expected way (cross-cleaning a RecoEcalCandidate from two PFJets).\r\n\r\nNB: It wasn't obvious to me this was the case at first, but using the same EDFilter module for both electrons and photons is in-line with existing HLT paths and code (see the Ele-Tau cross trigger, which uses a HLT2PhotonTau EDFilter in its cross-cleaning module, hltOverlapFilterIsoEle24IsoTau30WPTightGsfCaloJet5).", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1678281170", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["hlt-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_1_X", "number": 40994, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "add plugin to use existing HLTDoubleSinglet module with two PFJets an", "updated_at": "1678282041", "user": "brallmond"}

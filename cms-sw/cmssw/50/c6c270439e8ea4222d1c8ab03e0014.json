It was found that events pass both paths and use the triplet filter in the expected way (cross-cleaning a RecoEcalCandidate from two PFJets).\r\n\r\nNB: It wasn't obvious to me this was the case at first, but using the same EDFilter module for both electrons and photons is in-line with existing HLT paths and code (see the Ele-Tau cross trigger, which uses a HLT2PhotonTau EDFilter in its cross-cleaning module, hltOverlapFilterIsoEle24IsoTau30WPTightGsfCaloJet5).", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1678291786", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1678281170", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["hlt-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "9cb7ecf188ec5137583972656bf0929af63b03f4", "merged_at": "1678291786", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_13_1_X", "number": 40994, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add plugin to use existing HLTDoubleSinglet module with two PFJets and one RecoEcalCandidate", "updated_at": "1678291786", "user": "brallmond"}

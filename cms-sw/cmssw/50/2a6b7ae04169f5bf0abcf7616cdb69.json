The fileNames() function returns std::vectorstd::string which the code sets iterators to which then instantly become invalid as they are dangling.\r\n\r\nThis keeps an internal copy of the returned std::vector and sets the iterators to that.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nIt now successfully processes events in multiple files rather than spewing random garbage to the terminal.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nbackport of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/37677\r\n\r\nIt would make life easier for FOG to have this in CMSSW_12_3_X as this will simplify our lives when dealing with error stream events during commissioning. \r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1651066479", "comments": 8, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1650950393", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["daq-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "bug-fix", "orp-approved", "backport-ok"], "merge_commit_sha": "23343c99af685fb8742d37ad971a27e1c1afdbc7", "merged_at": "1651066479", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 37678, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "FRDStreamSource Dangling Reference Fix : 12_3_X", "updated_at": "1651066479", "user": "Sam-Harper"}

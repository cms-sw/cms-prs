This change in particular made Puppi 23% faster (tested on a ttbar UL sample in 10_6_X).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles and runs successfully, no changes expected or observed.\r\n\r\nThis PR will be backported to 10_6_X to speed up ultra-legacy analysis processing. Backports to other releases can be made upon request.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1634997264", "deletions": 12, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "number": 35799, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Speed up Puppi", "updated_at": "1634997991", "user": "kpedro88"}

It adds `fillDescriptions` (and applies light modification to modernize the source code) to a few `EDProducer`s used at HLT for both Run 3 and Phase 2. \r\n   * unfortunately due to the inheritance structure of the general utility classes in the `CommonTools` subsystem the changes needed to be extended to a lot of other modules that are not used at HLT (commit ed3c0a21451352c073fcdbb7f278b866cc708d0c). \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n   * `addOnTests.py` runs fine. \r\n   * `hltPhase2UpgradeIntegrationTests` runs fine. \r\n   * `runTheMatrix.py -l limited` runs fine.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

A while back I added a line of code to the ROOT 6 to ignore a new harmless warning message from ROOT6.   Unbeknown to me, the same warning was also added to a later version of ROOT 5, so Chris Jones added effectively the same line of code in 7_1_X.  That just got carried forward into the ROOT6 branch, so it is now done twice.  This request removes the line that I added earlier to avoid doing the same thing twice, and to increase code commonality.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_ROOT6_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1394205159", "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1394200639", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "109d53301c7892c387b0267171ef4778c8e2c31a", "merged_at": "1394205159", "merged_by": "davidlt", "number": 2767, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Remove redundant line of code", "updated_at": "1394370302", "user": "wmtan"}

TriggerJSONMonitoring has been split into L1TriggerJSONMonitoring and HLTriggerJSONMonitoring. The HLT JSON file is very similar to what it was (the only difference is that the prescale index is no longer stored there). The L1 JSON file is completely different: technical triggers are gone, algorithm tables are now 512 bits and the prescale index has been moved to here.\n\nThe old TriggerJSONMonitoring is still there for now so as to be able to easily revert in case we run into problems. The only change to it is the one of the namespace names. It will be deleted once the new way is proven to work.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 8, "closed_at": "1460621944", "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1460439442", "deletions": 12, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "hlt-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "085d92a376a1d33977c123de467f39e4f9420e3f", "merged_at": "1460621944", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 14030, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Finalizing JSON monitoring for 2016", "updated_at": "1460621945", "user": "avetisya"}

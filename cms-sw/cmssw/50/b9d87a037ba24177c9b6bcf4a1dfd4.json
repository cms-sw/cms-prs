The failures are all due to the missing `Tracker*Rcd` records in the base phase-2 Global Tag key in autoCond (`auto:phase2_realistic`). For the moment I just redirect the tests to use one of the geometry-flavoured keys, but eventually also the base one could use the records relative to the default geometry (T21, at the time of writing).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRun `scram b runtests`.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

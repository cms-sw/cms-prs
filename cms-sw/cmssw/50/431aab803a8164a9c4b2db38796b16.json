Unit tests pass.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nUnlikely to be backported.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 20, "comments": 8, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1697552504", "deletions": 761, "labels": ["core-pending", "operations-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_3_X", "number": 43042, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 13, "state": "open", "title": "argparse migration for cmsDriver and FWCore", "updated_at": "1697607237", "user": "kpedro88"}

This is a bit easier because no other build targets depend of these.\r\n\r\nLittle particularity: the `Geometry/CaloEventSetup` library had no BuildFile before because it was headers only, but now I added a `BuildFile.xml` to specify the dependencies of these header files, so they are correctly propagated. Otherwise, the build targets that require `Geometry/CaloEventSetup` have to make the corresponding `use` statements even if they don't use the libraries themselves. Furthermore, a few includes that were clearly out of place were removed.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCMSSW compiles. It was checked that all newly added dependencies are actually required by the package with `git grep`.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 124, "closed_at": "1585738306", "comments": 23, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1585125593", "deletions": 549, "labels": ["alca-approved", "analysis-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "db-pending", "dqm-approved", "geometry-approved", "hlt-approved", "orp-approved", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "2df9846e8c1bf1997b90c090d6286c9c99381aa4", "merged_at": "1585738306", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 29295, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Remove unneeded dependencies from plugins, test and bin in Reco subsystems", "updated_at": "1585738307", "user": "guitargeek"}

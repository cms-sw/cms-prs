This is due to a missing update of ```MTDTimeCalib``` for this geometry scenario. This PR updates that class, excluding conditions for scenarios that are no more maintained in the release since a while.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe BTL hits time resolution plot for scenario D105 is now centred reasonably at 0, as it should (test wf. 27634.0):\r\n\r\n![BTLTimeRes](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/assets/4058194/b135b638-0c29-4369-9788-ed8e46defe95)\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1705934496", "comments": 12, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1705496149", "deletions": 7, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "bug-fix", "orp-approved", "upgrade-approved", "code-checks-approved", "mtd"], "merge_commit_sha": "f09c4d3b0135d317d7f68958068577cbbeb799db", "merged_at": "1705934496", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "number": 43732, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "MTD reconstruction: fix BTL time for missing correction in BTL geometry v3 (scenario I17)", "updated_at": "1705934497", "user": "fabiocos"}

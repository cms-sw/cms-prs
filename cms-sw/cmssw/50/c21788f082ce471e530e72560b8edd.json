It clusters the final LHE particles using the anti-kt jet algorithm. A cut on the minimum pT > 350 GeV  is selected. This filter is  a loose pre-selection of the AK8-jet pT > 650 GeV filter at particle level used in the production of TT_AK8HT650* samples. The pre-filter selects at LHE level 99.8% of the events with a jet of pT > 650 GeV at particle level, while only 3% of the inclusive ttbar sample passes the filter. Therefore, the number of  events that have to be showered before the filter decision is drastically reduced.    \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTests have shown that this pre-filter reduces the the run time per event from  ~1.3s to ~0.2s.  \r\n\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1566853408", "comments": 31, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1566215460", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["backport-ok", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "generators-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "0920e9c555a54b35a5b8ae208068c950e0ba85e5", "merged_at": "1566853408", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 27794, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add TopLHEFilter", "updated_at": "1566853408", "user": "ohindrichs"}

Further tests performed locally showing expected behavior of the code changes--namely, when doAnd is set to true with non-zero values for cut and cutOverE specified, all resulting scouting electrons in the collection obey H < cutOverE*E + cut and the number of these electrons is reasonable.\r\n\r\nTested in CMSSW_12_5_1 successfully with new 'doAnd' variable set to both True and False.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nBackport to 12_5_X for: https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/39762\r\nNeeded for possible testing of new Scouting menu at end of 2022 data-taking.\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1666254989", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["hlt-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "backport-ok"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 39793, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Add option to cut H<a+bE+cE*E backport to 12_5_X", "updated_at": "1666277570", "user": "bennettgberg"}

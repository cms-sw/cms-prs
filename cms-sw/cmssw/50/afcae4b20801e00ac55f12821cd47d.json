This should provide a more clear separation between creating the objects and filling histograms. \r\n\r\nAs for the PFJet issue (#23458 ) the new module dependency, `l1tPFMetNoMuForDQM`, should be picked up automagically by CMSSW unscheduled running.\r\n\r\nPart 4 (minor fixes) will follow shortly.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 9, "comments": 10, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1528186278", "deletions": 12, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 23476, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[L1T][DQMOffline] Added PFMetNoMu to L1T Offline DQM", "updated_at": "1528196995", "user": "kreczko"}

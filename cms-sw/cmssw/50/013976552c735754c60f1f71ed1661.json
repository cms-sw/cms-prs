Most of the edits were made automatically using a Python script, with a few corner cases fixed by hand afterward.\n\nRemaining types of Era imports still to be dealt with:\n1) In various Tracking cff files, there is a call to `getattr(eras,era)` in a general loop.\n2) `cmsRun` configs generated by `cmsDriver` use the import to initialize the `cms.Process` object. (Most of the tracked configs are stored in `test` directories, so aren't picked up by checkdeps.)\n3) Only in Configuration/DataProcessing, `import Configuration.StandardSequences.Eras as eras`.\n\nThese special cases of imports should probably be addressed by someone who understands the expected function of the code.\n\nThis PR is going to touch a huge number of categories, but I would appreciate merging it quickly once it's confirmed not to cause any regressions, in order to avoid never-ending rebases. We should start enforcing the new way of importing specific modifiers in open PRs. I tested this PR using the short matrix in the latest IB and all tests passed.\n\nattn: @davidlange6, @Dr15Jones, @slava77 \n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 239, "closed_at": "1475083743", "comments": 25, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1474992743", "deletions": 952, "labels": ["alca-pending", "analysis-pending", "comparison-available", "core-approved", "daq-pending", "dqm-pending", "fastsim-pending", "geometry-approved", "l1-approved", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "df1fc8be306fb57dd4b8f29cd5a592237c2dc453", "merged_at": "1475083743", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 16001, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Better era imports", "updated_at": "1475472503", "user": "kpedro88"}

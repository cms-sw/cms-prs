Similarly, the change we implemented takes the SrFlags collection and produce a new collections storing only the flags matched to digis that are finally kept in the stream output.\r\n\r\nThe BuildFile.xml must have a new line to include a header used by the source.\r\n\r\nTested from release CMSSW_9_2_12_patch1 running the (updated) HLT configuration on HLTPhysics dataset. The new collections are created and stored in the output dataset.\r\nThe event size changes by 2% from 1.96 kB/event to 1.99 kB/event\r\n\r\nA similar pull request has been opened from 9_4_X release to master branch (see https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/20973)", "branch": "CMSSW_9_2_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1509086234", "comments": 11, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1508430054", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["backport-ok", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "hlt-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "21dd80f7eb5436a85fed6f2a8bbdee6d64813872", "merged_at": "1509086234", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_2_X", "number": 20974, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "saving the collections of ECAL selective readout flags (SrFlags) matc", "updated_at": "1509086235", "user": "cippy"}

Replaced the 4 Iterations with a single global one.\r\n- Enabling the possibility to fall back to TICLv3 with `--procModifiers ticl_v3`.\r\n- Tackster-Trackster and Trackster-Track geometrical linking. Propagating Tracksters and Tracks to\r\n  the same plane, if they fall in the same eta-phi window they are geometrically compatible. Trackster\r\n  and Tracks are then checked for Time compatibility. They are time compatible if within 3sigma of each other\r\n  or either of them does not have time available. Possible charged candidates are checked for energy compatibility\r\n  with the corresponding track. TICLCandidate and Track are energy compatible if the TICLCandidate's tracksters\r\n  cumulative energy does not exceed track momentum by more than a threshold. Track with no matched Trackster are\r\n  promoted to charged-TICLCandidate. Note that muon tracks are masked and not used for the linking. \r\n- Improved Particle Flow interpretation\r\n\r\n- More details on the Linking step here: [Linking](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1167627/contributions/4906008/attachments/2454845/4207362/ticlv4-linking.pdf)\r\n\r\n\r\n-  CLUE3D performance compared to Cellular Automaton: \r\n\r\n    - [CLUE3DvsCA](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1160548/contributions/4873846/attachments/2443268/4186202/Updates%20on%20energy%20reconstruction%20with%20PU%20(1).pdf)  \r\n    - [CLUE3DvsCATiming](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1162565/contributions/4885086/attachments/2447097/4193233/Updates%20on%20Clue3D%20performance%20with%20PU%20(3).pdf)\r\n\r\nPR validated on CMSSW_12_5_0_pre3. \r\n- Timing comparison between TICLv4 and TICLv3, obtained on RelVal QCD PU 200, 10 events: \r\n  - [TICLv4](https://wredjeb.web.cern.ch/HGCAL/TICLv4PFValidation/web/piechart.php?local=false&dataset=resources&resource=time_real&colours=default&groups=packages&threshold=0)\r\n  - [TICLv3](https://wredjeb.web.cern.ch/HGCAL/TICLv4PFValidation/web/piechart.php?local=false&dataset=resources_v3&resource=time_real&colours=default&groups=packages&threshold=0)\r\n  \r\n Physics Performances: \r\n - RecoParticleFlow Validation on `RelValQCD_Pt15To7000_Flat_14` PU200, D88 Geometry:\r\n   - [PFValidation](https://wredjeb.web.cern.ch/HGCAL/TICLv4PFValidation/plots_v3_v4_pu200/)\r\n\r\n**EDIT 08/08 :** \r\n- Small bug fix, setting Trackster `seedIndex` default value to -1,  since 0 is a valid `seedIndex`.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 22, "closed_at": "1661867977", "comments": 37, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1658999620", "deletions": 495, "labels": ["dqm-approved", "hlt-approved", "operations-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "pdmv-approved", "orp-approved", "upgrade-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "92ac7dc18816b002c87eacd7be802e6a8d8a06b2", "merged_at": "1661867977", "merged_by": "rappoccio", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_6_X", "number": 38880, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 38, "state": "closed", "title": "TICL version 4: CLUE3D as default Pattern Recognition, Linking", "updated_at": "1661867995", "user": "waredjeb"}

There is no good reason for this, and it may be confusing.  So, I removed productHistoryRegistryUpdate(), which was called in fewer places than productHistoryRegistryForUpdate(), and replaced its usage.  The function need not be public.\nThis PR is fairly trivial.\nIf the DQM L2 does not respond in a timely manner, I suggest that the DQM signature be bypassed, as there are no functional changes to DQM.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1432561591", "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1432382604", "deletions": 7, "labels": ["comparison-available", "core-approved", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "7b1bb36e84ab33d79afd51d3bdf47914d48140c2", "merged_at": "1432561591", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 9249, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Remove duplicate function productHistoryRegistryUpdate()", "updated_at": "1432749354", "user": "wmtan"}

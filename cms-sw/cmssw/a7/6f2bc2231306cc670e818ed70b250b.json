Follow-up of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/33389. The hit counters are not enabled yet.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles. The hit counters run parallel with the ordinary ALCT and CLCT finding.  Tested with WF 11634.0. There should be no differences. \r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nN/A. We expect the (local trigger, track-finder, uGMT) firmware to be available by Summer 2021. I'll first develop the entire emulator in 11_3_X, then backport if need be.\r\n\r\nBefore submitting your pull requests, make sure you followed this checklist:\r\n- verify that the PR is really intended for the chosen branch\r\n- verify that changes follow [CMS Naming, Coding, And Style Rules](http://cms-sw.github.io/cms_coding_rules.html)\r\n- verify that the PR passes the basic test procedure suggested in the [CMSSW PR instructions](https://cms-sw.github.io/PRWorkflow.html)\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 19, "closed_at": "1618580516", "comments": 22, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1618274003", "deletions": 51, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "ebbf48cc7beb7c57af6b9a6824b963190b596063", "merged_at": "1618580516", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "number": 33416, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Hit counters for Run-3 shower CSC trigger (HadronicShowerTrigger-2)", "updated_at": "1618580524", "user": "dildick"}

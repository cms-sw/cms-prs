The uninitialized variables are mostly from the ends of partially filled vectors, which this PR initializes to zero where needed.  I tried to avoid unnecessary initializations, though in several cases it was difficult to track down exactly where the problem originated.\r\n\r\nIn addition, various minor cleanups were applied along the way.  In particular,\r\n\r\n- `const` was added where possible\r\n- a few declarations had their scope reduced\r\n- some instances of sqrt, fabs, etc. were replaced by std:: equivalents to avoid unwanted conversions to double\r\n- corrected a formatting issue where clang-format was disabled for a larger section of code than intended\r\n\r\nResolves https://github.com/cms-sw/framework-team/issues/1535\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTechnical fixes, no performance changes expected.  Checks with a small sample of recent TTBar SIM showed no differences in cpu or physics.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1768317456", "deletions": 121, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "tracking"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_1_X", "number": 49798, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "MkFit cleanups, mostly from valgrind memcheck", "updated_at": "1768317631", "user": "dan131riley"}

Please let me know if not.\n\nThe summary histograms and the tree are filled in the endJob, as before, because they require the lower level histograms to be completely filled first, and it would be inefficient to reset every run.  However, the structure (e.g. which histograms summarize which other histograms), which comes from the tracker topology, is set up at the beginning.  In my tests I find identical output to setting the lastSetup variable.\n\nThis is orthogonal to #11022 except for one commit, which is rebased here to avoid conflicts.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1442579198", "comments": 8, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1441547176", "deletions": 73, "labels": ["alca-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "aabedd68ecd001aa5c56da304c15911fe18110b9", "merged_at": "1442579198", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 11162, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Finally fix segfault!", "updated_at": "1442581104", "user": "hroskes"}

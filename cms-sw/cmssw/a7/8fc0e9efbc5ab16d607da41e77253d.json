The modules fixed are:\n\nEleIdCutBasedExtProducer\nEleIsoDetIdCollectionProducer\nElectronSeedProducer\nGEDPhotonProducer\nPhotonProducer\nHFRecoEcalCandidateProducer\nHFEMClusterProducer\n\nThe last EGM module I saw was PhotonValidator in the Validation/RecoEgamma package. I decided not to fix that because the issue is in SimTracker/TrackerHitAssociation/src/TrackerHitAssociator.cc so didnt want to trample over others code.\n\nIn the 24/04 IB, runTheMatix.py -s failed due to missing services but it fails on a clean release too so I do not think this is my issue. They all pass in 22/04 IB which is the release I developed the code on.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "changed_files": 18, "closed_at": "1398439858", "comments": 8, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1398337448", "deletions": 92, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "4f2d714718c0662740fc6e09320b49d6932d94fc", "merged_at": "1398439858", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_1_0_pre7", "number": 3480, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Eg consumes migration", "updated_at": "1405415476", "user": "Sam-Harper"}

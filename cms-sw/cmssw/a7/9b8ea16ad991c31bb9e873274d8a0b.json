Since the first pair of plots have a number of bins or 150 and 50 respectively, while the cluster charge and size have 100 and 30 respectively, we have gain in number of bins.\r\n\r\nAdditionally few plots produced in the TrackEfficiency plugin are completely removed", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1501674204", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1501597399", "deletions": 57, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "6e42d43fda0d479ba2f034c768087bf23b384962", "merged_at": "1501674204", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_3_X", "number": 20005, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "rearranging some plots saving bins", "updated_at": "1501674204", "user": "fioriNTU"}

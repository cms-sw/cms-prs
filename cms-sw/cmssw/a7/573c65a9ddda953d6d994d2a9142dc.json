[cms-sw/cmssw#43723](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/43723) shows that in CMSSW_14_0_0_pre2, a problem emerges when tracks with |eta| > 2.4 are put through the emulator, causing the resultant bin index to have a negative value. The quick fix is to simply discard tracks outside of the allowed eta region for the track jet emulator. There should be no change to the output jets. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/43723#issuecomment-1920655663 this comment shows a specific event that causes a segfault.

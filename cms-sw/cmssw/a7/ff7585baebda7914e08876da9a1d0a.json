The RootAutoLibraryLoader (package FWCore/RootAutoLibraryLoader) is no longer needed for releases using ROOT6.  This pull request removes the entire FWCore/RootAutoLibraryLoader package, and all external references to it.  With this PR, all the framework unit tests still pass, as well as the unit tests for the other two affected packages.  Also, all relvals in the short matrix still pass.  Note: The AutoLibraryLoader in FWCore/FWLite is distinct from RootAutoLibraryLoader, and is not removed by this pull request, as it is still needed.\nPlease merge this pull request as soon as convenient.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_ROOT6_X", "changed_files": 32, "closed_at": "1424197597", "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1424197254", "deletions": 620, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "core-pending", "db-pending", "dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "bdf3796d4e5ad639a694acd31db35596b056fce3", "merged_at": "1424197597", "merged_by": "ktf", "number": 7824, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Remove package not needed for ROOT6 releases", "updated_at": "1424204635", "user": "wmtan"}

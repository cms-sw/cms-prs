It is done now in preparation of further development for cmssw_11_3.\r\nMay other variables were renamed as well to improve clarity and readability. No functionality changes have been introduced by this.\r\nThere were also some other cosmetic changes concerning comments and white-spaces.\r\nTwo unused/obsolete methods were removed from the structs in the header files.\r\nA missing initialization of the variable betastop_ has been added. This only affects the results when Tmin was initialized with an illegal value, which of course should never happen.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe code was tested in CMSSW_11_3_0_pre2 against relvals and no difference was found to the original code.\r\nrunTheMatrix resulted in no failures.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1613348277", "comments": 38, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1611845634", "deletions": 950, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "37bbe7cbcf138ef3380925f27569197951dae5e7", "merged_at": "1613348277", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 32764, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 11, "state": "closed", "title": "avoid single letter names and code cleanup", "updated_at": "1613348277", "user": "werdmann"}

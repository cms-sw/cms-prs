Histograms with more than around 1e7 entries in a bin will stop accumulation in that bin (because within numerical precision `x + 1. == x`).\r\nThis PR changes the booking of `StandaloneTrackMonitor` and `TrackTypeMonitor` plots, from using `book1D` to `book1DD` in order to use double precision in bin content accumulation.\r\nTo limit the amount of changes in the tracking monitor classes a new overloaded `book1DD` method is added to `DQMStore` in order to be able to use the `TH1D` constructor of the type that creates a 1-Dim histogram with variable bins of type `double`: \r\n`TH1D (const char *name, const char *title, Int_t nbinsx, const Float_t *xbins)`\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n`cmssw` compiles.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nNot a backport, but it might be backported for convenience if validation is positive.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 4, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1718346071", "deletions": 331, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved", "tracking"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 45225, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "double precision in `StandaloneTrackMonitor` and `TrackTypeMonitor` plots to avoid numerical overflow with high number of bin counts", "updated_at": "1718346838", "user": "mmusich"}

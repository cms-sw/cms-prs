These are added by default.\r\n    - MET unclustered computation: from master #29331 #29392 and #29918: (or, more clearly consistently, from 10_6_X #29330 and #29392 and fixes in  #29919). To preserve consistency with production, these are added via run2_miniAOD_devel, as in 10_6_X\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": "1595655385", "comments": 42, "commits": 18, "created_at": "1594121213", "deletions": 60, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "739302f2d0e45e7b07a5a2e39238ec7e62b0986e", "merged_at": "1595655385", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 30572, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 23, "state": "closed", "title": "Fixing MET unclustered energy computation and DeepCSV NaN issue (backport of  #29331 and #24943)", "updated_at": "1595655386", "user": "nistefan"}

Should probably report to eigen people.\n\nThere are a few places where non-unrollable views are used because of the eigen interface, but that's life.\n\nNo differences expected/observed.\n\n@VinInn @bendavid \n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_3_X", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1412309387", "comments": 14, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1412084144", "deletions": 39, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "19b1a349ac19e746e66ea4a24c8ffa83ef1a85d4", "merged_at": "1412309387", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_3_X", "number": 5628, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 10, "state": "closed", "title": "Speed improvements for ECAL multifit", "updated_at": "1412309387", "user": "lgray"}

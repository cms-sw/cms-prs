In the broken code some lines were commented out with a clear message saying this was done only to make things compile properly. We need this code in the BTV group to do tests on the track History flags (BWeakDecay, etc...) on RECODEBUG samples.\n\nThe reason why the old code did not compile was because in the past a conversion was made from using HepMC::GenPartices to using reco::GenParticles to save memory. since these two classes do not share the same functionalities the code that reads the GenParticles was broken.\n\nI did not remove any of the old functionality to avoid breaking any existing code, but I added on top of everything a new container that saves reco::GenParticles and traces the history of generator particles related to a Tracking Particle using the mother() function of reco::GenParticles.\n\nI tested the results and now the history of generated particles makes sense again. I do not expect problems in the unit tests since I heard the TrackHistory code is not tested, but internally we tested and validated the results.\n\n@acaudron @imarches @mverzett @JyothsnaKomaragiri might want to follow this as well since this fix is intended for the BTV group.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1476364079", "comments": 8, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1476087629", "deletions": 37, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "710580d23984d115b86a7bbf73d830ff8ee849ac", "merged_at": "1476364079", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 16161, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix track history81 x", "updated_at": "1476364080", "user": "smoortga"}

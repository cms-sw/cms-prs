This PR fixes the issue. These are the tags from which the DQM GUI reads the list of known problematic towers in ECAL and displays them as dark red/dark yellow vs red/yellow.\r\nThis PR also adds the current sqlite file and text file used to produce it with the latest towers.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nPR is validated by running a local test which successfully creates an sqlite file which is uploaded to the DB and verified with an online DQM run on a test DQM GUI. Everything looks as expected.", "branch": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1655706071", "comments": 1, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1655706039", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 38431, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Update ecal dqm channel tower status 123 x", "updated_at": "1655706071", "user": "abhih1"}

This PR fixes the parsing to take into account both cases. Without the fix, the producer simply takes the weights at indices 6--10 which do not correspond to the nominal isr/fsr variations.\r\n\r\nAlong with the fix, the branch doc string of `PSWeight` is also updated to fill in actual branch names from the header to provide a cross check.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested with NANO workflows.\r\n\r\nFYI - @cms-sw/generators-l2", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1738626222", "deletions": 9, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved", "xpog-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_0_X", "number": 47253, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[NANO] Fix PS weight parsing", "updated_at": "1738626898", "user": "hqucms"}

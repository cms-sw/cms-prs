Construction of rawPCCProducer that will loop over the modules and count the pixel clusters \r\n2. Harvesters to save reco::PCC object (output from AlcaPCCProducer) and LumiInfo object (output from rawPCCProducer)\r\n\r\nOther collaborators working directly on this project:\r\n@capalmer85 \r\n\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_9_1_X", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1491334426", "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1491334395", "deletions": 0, "labels": [], "number": 18203, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Pixel Cluster Counting Automation", "updated_at": "1491429659", "user": "samhiggie"}

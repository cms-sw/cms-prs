Geometry mode is used to specify the detector scenario. LHC was the fixed version of legacy detector. New modes are defined to specify the current situation with new ZDC assignment with the RPD detector (Run3) and the Phase2 setup (Run4) with no HE detector. It will be expanded in future to mark when HF DetIds were enlarged (2016), HE started expansion (2017) and HB had several depths (post LS2). Some of this is reflected in this version of HcalTopology.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nUse the runTheMatrix test workflows\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

To avoid the problem, this PR declares a local TContext object in the scope where TFile::Open() is called; when the TContext goes out of scope, its destructor unregisters the context, guaranteeing the context is unregistered in the same thread it was registered in.  Hopefully fixes issue #15524.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1472617906", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1472594415", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["comparison-available", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "2c5ce502b57f73795c52dc23f5f76c4786c03c5f", "merged_at": "1472617906", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 15670, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Create a context around TFile::Open() so the context is unregistered ", "updated_at": "1507556343", "user": "dan131riley"}

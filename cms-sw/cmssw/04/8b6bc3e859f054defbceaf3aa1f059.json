This removal is a follow up on the discussion taken in [PR40100](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/40100#issuecomment-1322129298).\r\n- We want to remove the 'mvaValue' and 'lowptMvaValue' from miniAOD because those MVAs are not updated and they are not used by anyone. The analyses using these MVAs use nanoAOD, and there the MVAs are correct.\r\n- When I was doing it, I found that inside the loop where the MVAs values were computed, it was also filled the selector 'MultiIsoMedium' and the variables 'jetPtRel' and 'jetPtRatio'. I talked to SUSY group to see if they were variables that were currently in use and, after checking with analyzers, they told me to leave them in the code. In short, I deleted the MVAs and everything related to them and renamed the module 'MuonMvaEstimator' to 'CalculatePtRatioRel'.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n- We check the output running runTheMatrix and everything looks fine.\r\n- We execute the basic tests  suggested in the [CMSSW PR instructions](https://cms-sw.github.io/PRWorkflow.html).\r\n\r\n#### This PR is a backport of [PR#40876](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/40876).", "branch": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "changed_files": 13, "closed_at": "1679977777", "comments": 16, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1678723399", "deletions": 315, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "backport-ok", "xpog-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "fd56960cb8e2e8332d874ce5d63a766f9ff85691", "merged_at": "1679977777", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "number": 41043, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Removing not used muon MVAs from miniAOD (backport)", "updated_at": "1679977778", "user": "andrea21z"}

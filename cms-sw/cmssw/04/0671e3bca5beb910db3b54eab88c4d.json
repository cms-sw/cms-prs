This work is part of a somewhat larger project to clean up the GEM-CSC integrated trigger code in view of a future implementation in firmware. The GEMCoPadProcessor class has a similar function as the ALCT and CLCT processors; it produces trigger primitives from digis. The GEMCoPadProcessor can produce copads starting from a GEMPadDigiCollection (current default) or from a GEMPadDigiClusterCollection. The extra class reduces code duplication in the GE11 and GE21 integrated local triggers. It has its own parameterset in the python configuration. The parameters \"maxDeltaPadGE11\" and \"maxDeltaPadGE21\" will be optimized in the future.\r\n\r\n* A look-up-table generator was added. It produces LUT that match GEM pads with CSC halfstrips, GEM rolls with CSC wiregroups, etc. The LUT generating code in the CSCMotherBoardMEX1GEM classes will be cleaned up later.\r\n\r\n@tahuang1991", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 10, "closed_at": "1493189797", "comments": 75, "commits": 9, "created_at": "1489026413", "deletions": 199, "labels": ["comparison-available", "l1-approved", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "upgrade-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "40ac737f92b4eff89f9de04bdc826d6c9229f316", "merged_at": "1493189797", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_1_X", "number": 17843, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 6, "state": "closed", "title": "Add GEM copad processor and LUT generator class", "updated_at": "1493723491", "user": "dildick"}

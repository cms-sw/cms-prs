Looking at the diffs it looks as though that pull request reverts the fix he put in from #4231.\nAll I've done is merged #4313 into the latest IB, then\n\n```\ngit cherry-pick d493d44\n```\n\nwhich is the SHA for the only commit in #4231.\n@bsunanda could you check the file changes and see if this is actually what you want?  If so then close #4313. Thanks.\nI've tested that it fixes the 14200 test, I'm currently running other tests and will comment on the pr later.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "changed_files": 17, "closed_at": "1403598784", "comments": 2, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1403532806", "deletions": 189, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "geometry-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "ac64c80417bbc7eb90bf2e0a019663b817aff300", "merged_at": "1403598784", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "number": 4358, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Reapply #4231 on to #4313", "updated_at": "1427127962", "user": "mark-grimes"}

Cleaning that up got a bit out of hand, so therefore a separate PR here.\r\n\r\n- All files in `DQMServices/Core` now have a well defined, up to date purpose.\r\n   - I removed some old headers (+usages of `DQMError`), `DQMOldReciever` (from run 1, i think?), the ever-empty `doc/` folder\r\n   - I also removed the tests in `DQMServices/Core`, primarily because the are not set up in scram, so it's not clear how to use them and they might not work any more. Many of them also tested obsolete and removed features.\r\n   - Finally, I removed the \"standalone\" mode. We gave up supporting it a while ago already. DQMGUI will keep using its CMSSW7 version of `DQMStore` for the future.\r\n- I removed all usages of `forceReset*`, `enableMultiThread`, `referenceFileName`, and `collateHistograms` options on the `DQMStore` across all of CMSSW. The `DQMStore` stopped using these options a while ago. This affects multiple categories of files:\r\n   - Random, potentially obsolete and hard-to-test configs. We could leave them unchanged for historical value, but I think that would be more confusing.\r\n   - Online DQM. The `referenceFileName` there was (maybe?) actually still used in last collisions data taking, but we decided to remove the references entirely anyways.\r\n   - Production offline and HLT configs.  These are pretty important.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nNot much. Needs more testing.\r\n\r\nBy construction everything removed here was no longer respected anyways, so nothing should change anywhere. But the changes do affect some important code that I have very little understanding of, so there may be side effects.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 199, "closed_at": "1589900847", "comments": 48, "commits": 15, "created_at": "1588690242", "deletions": 1486, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "daq-pending", "dqm-approved", "hlt-approved", "l1-approved", "operations-approved", "orp-approved", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "3e9aa8fdc4a55ee1f5f782deeb9e2af83ededd12", "merged_at": "1589900847", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 29742, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "DQM: Clean up DQMServices/Core and its usages", "updated_at": "1589900847", "user": "schneiml"}

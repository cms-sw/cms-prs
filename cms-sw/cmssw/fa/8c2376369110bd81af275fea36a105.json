The updates contained in this PR will be included in the 10_6_X 2016 UL production and the changes have already been merged in master. A 10_6_X backport PR will be prepared as well.\r\n\r\nI'm not certain that an 11_0_X backport is strictly necessary as no 2016 production campaign is planned for 11_0_X; the 10_6_X backport is more important. But since these changes will be used in both 11_1_X and 10_6_X, it seems less confusing to have the changes in 11_0_X as well. Since this PR is mainly intended for the bookkeeping of sensible default values for RelVal workflows, I will let PdmV experts decide if they want it merged in 11_0_X as well.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe changes have been validated within the 2016 10_6_X UL campaign: https://indico.cern.ch/event/865993/#15-tracker-on-ul-16\r\n\r\nIn addition, a technical test was performed: `runTheMatrix.py -l limited,7.22 --ibeos`\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nThis PR is a backport of PR #28624.", "branch": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1580838814", "comments": 15, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1580333100", "deletions": 10, "labels": ["alca-approved", "analysis-approved", "backport-ok", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "pdmv-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "8d9690a3dfa810689356645dec92b2b089962970", "merged_at": "1580838813", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 28824, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Use correct beamspot for 2016 MC + update MC tracker alignment scenario for 2016 pre-VFP era [11_0_X]", "updated_at": "1582052302", "user": "christopheralanwest"}

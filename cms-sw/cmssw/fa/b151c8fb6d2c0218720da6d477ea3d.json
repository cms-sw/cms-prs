The changes will affect all workflows with HGCal. Mapping from position to DetId and vice versa are revised. This affects the public methods used in HGCalGeometry (getPosition, getClosestCell) and in HGCalDDDConstants (locateCell, locateCellHex, waferFromPosition, waferPosition). In the process the access method of getting position from ID is modified - earlier it was split between HGCalGeometry and HGCalDDConstant. Now it is done entirely in HGCalDDDConstants and this has affected the precision and hence there will be small changes in all earlier results.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nUse the runTheMatrix test workflows \r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nNothing special", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 11, "comments": 55, "commits": 11, "created_at": "1633549205", "deletions": 70, "labels": ["simulation-pending", "geometry-approved", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-approved", "hgcal-dpg-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "number": 35563, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 26, "state": "open", "title": "Phase2-hgx291 Bug fix to address rotated layers in D86", "updated_at": "1634476558", "user": "bsunanda"}

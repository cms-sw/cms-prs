A copy of `SiStripDetVOff_prompt` - `SiStripDetVOff_prompt_test` was run for the tests and when it was failing it was trying to send a warning email which caused an exception. The exception's cause is providing a `bytes` object where `str` was expected.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested by running `SiStripDetVOff_prompt_test` on CMSSW_14_0_15_patch1 with local changes (this PR's fix). The O2O was failing when testing providing the certificate for T0 API access (see https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/45779) - setting TIER0_API_URL=https://cmsweb-preprod.cern.ch/t0wmadatasvc/prod/ (which requires the cert) but not setting X509_USER_CERT. An O2O failure in this test scenario is expected (no cert provided) but it shouldn't cause an error with the email warning and this PR fixes the email error.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

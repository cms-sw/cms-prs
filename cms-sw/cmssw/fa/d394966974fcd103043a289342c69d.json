Jets are checked on whether or not the go outside of the acceptance. When they fall out the kt area is scaled by the fraction of \"grid-jets\" that is inside the eta boundaries. There is a possibility to calculate empty areas in eta bins but because eta slices are narrow it is better to use it over the full acceptance which is the current default mode. This correction is only ran in 50-100% events.\n- Local eta branch from here:\n  https://github.com/CmsHI/cmssw/tree/csLocalEta/RecoHI/HiJetAlgos\n- Eta boundaries for rho calculator was tuned to reduce the eta dependence\n  Performance is documented in:\n  https://github.com/CmsHI/cmssw/tree/csLocalEta/RecoHI/HiJetAlgos\n\n@richard-cms could we merge this into forest, @mverwe might want to comment and take a look.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 1390, "closed_at": "1459504779", "comments": 2, "commits": 1147, "created_at": "1459504760", "deletions": 38369, "labels": ["alca-pending", "analysis-pending", "comparison-pending", "db-pending", "dqm-pending", "hlt-pending", "l1-pending", "new-package-pending", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 13883, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Cs tune", "updated_at": "1459504804", "user": "dgulhan"}

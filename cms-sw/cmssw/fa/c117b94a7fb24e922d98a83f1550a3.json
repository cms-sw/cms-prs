This is not allowed by the gcc and llvm implementations of the  proposed std::experimental::propagate_const it is meant to emulate.  This PR modifies edm::propagate_const to match the behavior of the gcc and llvm implementations.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n\"checkdeps -a -A\" checked out ~95% of CMSSW, but only one violation of the stricter check was found.  The only effects of this change should be compile time errors, but nevertheless a limited matrix was run, with no unexpected errors (some workflows failed with step 1 DAS errors).\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1568572263", "comments": 17, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1568462596", "deletions": 15, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "e980a4888b9edb1c5ea4f37d49ff138ecccec6c6", "merged_at": "1568572262", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27994, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "stronger edm::propagate_const const-correctness", "updated_at": "1568572263", "user": "dan131riley"}

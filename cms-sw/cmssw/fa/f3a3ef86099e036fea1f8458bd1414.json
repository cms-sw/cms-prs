I have just gotten rid of uninitialized reads.\n  - confirmed with valgrind as fixed\n- HcalZDCMonitor counters initialized (cleans up occasional NANs in the plots)\n  - confirmed with valgrind as fixed\n- B2GDQM was missing initialization of semiE_LepJetPtCut (the default uninitialized value was between zero and any other value; it now becomes 30 GeV as desired in the config). Corresponding plots will change.\n  - confirmed with valgrind as fixed\n- EcalClusterLazyToolsBase had reads beyond vector size (should be harmless from the logic)\n  - confirmed with valgrind as fixed\n- patPFMETCorrections changes appear to be cosmetic\n  - the invalid read in SmearedJetProducerT calling StringCutObjectSelector still remains\n- changes in cscdqm::StripClusterFinder are towards cleaning of uninitialized values in StripClusterFitData::height_\n  - cleanup is not confirmed by valgrind\n\nTested in CMSSW_7_6_X_2015-08-30-2300 /test area sign584/. \n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 8, "closed_at": "1441868239", "comments": 6, "commits": 8, "created_at": "1441647016", "deletions": 15, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-available", "dqm-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "7117cfb757bb6603137a016fdf8209019bbd6bcd", "merged_at": "1441868239", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 11173, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "cleanup of uninitialized reads reported by valgrind", "updated_at": "1441868240", "user": "slava77"}

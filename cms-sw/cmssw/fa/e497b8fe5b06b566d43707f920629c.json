In the next two weeks I'll be at a conference and then on holidays, so I will be able to follow up on this PR only intermittently.\n\n@arizzi\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": "1408945111", "comments": 5, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1407526746", "deletions": 8, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "comparison-pending", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "5d539c33d2495a87209ec9826f12bb3a9052ea32", "merged_at": "1408945111", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_0_X", "number": 4914, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "MiniAOD 7.0.X fixes from CSA14 feedback", "updated_at": "1443642456", "user": "gpetruc"}

A collection of tau decay products is created on the fly and then stored in a new NanoAOD table. Additional information stored is as follows for each candidate in the table:\r\n\r\n- 3-momenta\r\n- PDG ID\r\n- Index of its mother tau\r\n\r\nSize tests have been conducted to assess the size increase on NanoAOD. These tests have been conducted using two RelVal samples:\r\n\r\n- TTBar (/w PU)\r\n- ZTT\r\n\r\nThe cumulative contribution of the tau decay products in NanoAOD is expected to be around 1.3 % (TTBar) and 2% (ZTT). Breakdowns are available [here](https://cernbox.cern.ch/s/7ImmLYlChHIIS41).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nThis PR was tested successfully with custom NanoAOD workflows (size measurements) and matrix tests are ongoing.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 0, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1697019558", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending", "xpog-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_3_X", "number": 42987, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Store tau decay products in new nanoAOD table", "updated_at": "1697019582", "user": "Ksavva1021"}

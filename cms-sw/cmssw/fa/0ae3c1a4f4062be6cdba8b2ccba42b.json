This PR fixes this by removing unnecessary non-ECAL development related tasks and making sure that all inputs for step3 and step4 are available.\r\nIt also runs the Phase 2 weights based uncalibrated RecHits producer introduced in #34505, the first ECAL Phase 2 reco algorithm. Small changes to the EcalRecHitProducer were necessary to allow it to run only on barrel uncalibrated RecHits as it will be for Phase 2.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nPasses the standard limited matrix tests and also 28234.61.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 10, "comments": 32, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1642597320", "deletions": 163, "labels": ["operations-pending", "dqm-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "pdmv-approved", "upgrade-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 36748, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 15, "state": "open", "title": "ECAL Phase 2 Development WF 28234.61 fix", "updated_at": "1643197875", "user": "thomreis"}

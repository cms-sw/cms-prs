This PR fixes this by removing unnecessary non-ECAL development related tasks and making sure that all inputs for step3 and step4 are available.\r\nIt also runs the Phase 2 weights based uncalibrated RecHits producer introduced in #34505, the first ECAL Phase 2 reco algorithm. Small changes to the EcalRecHitProducer were necessary to allow it to run only on barrel uncalibrated RecHits as it will be for Phase 2.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nPasses the standard limited matrix tests and also 28234.61.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 10, "closed_at": "1643631207", "comments": 43, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1642597320", "deletions": 163, "labels": ["dqm-approved", "operations-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "pdmv-approved", "orp-approved", "upgrade-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "a0bdd3dfefb87f9039685419855d0ae7a6eeba8d", "merged_at": "1643631207", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 36748, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 22, "state": "closed", "title": "ECAL Phase 2 Development WF 28234.61 fix", "updated_at": "1643631208", "user": "thomreis"}

This is to allow space for cooling pipes, as it will be in the detector to be installed.\r\nThere is no update in terms of Material Budget here, focus is geometry-only.\r\n\r\nGeometry scenario is: 2026D48.\r\nWorkflows are: 228xx (no PU), 230xx (PU).\r\n\r\nTracking performance should be compared with T15 (2026D46 scenario).\r\n\r\n\r\nNB:\r\n- Please merge PR #27665 first.\r\nPresent PR is created on top of 27665, to avoid having shifts in workflow numbering (no need to leave free spots for D47).\r\nI (might) have very trivial conflict to solve once 27665 is merged into master.\r\n\r\n- **IMPORTANT: This only introduces the skewed geometry description. There might be adjustments to do on CMSSW side to deal with the skewed ladders.** \r\nGot runs through the 4 steps without extra warning/error, which is already a good sign, but obviously does not mean at all everything is OK...\r\nOn CMSSW side, I checked that the sim **geometry construction** is OK.\r\nFirst feedback from @migliore is that DIGI step should be fine, this should be looked at in details though.\r\nPossible tunings needed on top of this PR!\r\n\r\n\r\n**PR validation:**\r\nFollowing was done for validation:\r\n- Solved all overlaps on CMSSW with Fireworks and Geant4 tools.\r\n- Checked sim **geometry construction** is OK on CMSSW side.\r\n- Even if the active geometry is different from T15, logically there should be no DetId diff (based on how the DetIds are computed in CMSSW). Checked that this is the case indeed.\r\nThis allows to reuse the fakeConditions from T15.\r\n- Checked no shift in workflows numbering.\r\n- Checked that workflows with D48 run smoothly with no extra error / warning.\r\n\r\n\r\nFYI: @emiglior @pwittich @bsunanda @fabiocos @kpedro88 @mmusich @jalimena @boudoul", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 9, "closed_at": "1567191788", "comments": 29, "commits": 9, "created_at": "1566477872", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "operations-approved", "orp-approved", "pdmv-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "d0001ef84815d349be9130402f405dedae4715f7", "merged_at": "1567191787", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27824, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 6, "state": "closed", "title": "Add Skewed Phase 2 Inner Tracker geometry (T16).", "updated_at": "1567191788", "user": "ghugo83"}

It will consume SuperClusters (new with TICLv5) only in TICLv5\r\n\r\nNew parameters have been included also at HLT \r\n\r\nThe performance against TICLv4 can be found in the DPS approval talk https://indico.cern.ch/event/1462666/contributions/6158255/attachments/2940573/5170734/TICLv5_DPS_version3.pdf\r\n\r\n\r\nShould be tested with a .203 workflow\r\n\r\nE.g.\r\n```\r\ntest parameters:\r\n\r\n    - workflow_opts= -w upgrade\r\n    - workflow = 29896.203, 29691.203, 29691.204\r\n    - enable = profiling, hlt_p2_timing\r\n```\r\n\r\nEdit 06/11/2024:\r\n\r\n - `hltTiclTracksterLinks_cfi` and `hltTiclTracksterLinksUnseeded_cfi`,  Both of them were Unseeded with no differences between them, for consistency I removed `hltTiclTracksterLinksUnseeded_cfi` fixing the Egamma sequence accordingly\r\n - I 've added the L1Seeded module and sequence for the Recovery Tracksters, it is not used but I added it for consistency with `hltTiclTracksterLinksL1Seeded_cfi`\r\n\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_14_2_X", "changed_files": 16, "comments": 18, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1732787210", "deletions": 279, "labels": ["hlt-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "bug-fix", "upgrade-approved", "backport-ok"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_2_X", "number": 46822, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[14_2_X] TICLv5a : Improve skeleton linking and parameters tuning", "updated_at": "1733132940", "user": "waredjeb"}

The pre-existing `TrackExtenderWithMTD` code is reorganized in one base class (`BaseExtenderWithMTD`) that contains all the common code related to the MTD hit objects and functions, and some other common functionalities. Therefore, two EDProducers are created: `TrackExtenderWithMTD` and `MuonExtenderWithMTD`. No change is expected in the `TrackExtenderWithMTD` producer. It's a lightweight version of the old code, since most of it was moved to the base class. The `MuonExtenderWithMTD` contains the needed customizations to run using `reco::Muon` or `reco::RecoChargedCandidate` as input. Currently, the code requires the muon to have a tracker track, which is extended to the MTD in the same way as in the `TrackExtenderWithMTD`.\r\n\r\nThis effort started within a phase-2 HLT task with the aim of studying the possibility of improving the muon isolation using timing information.\r\n\r\nThe code is organized as follows. \r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n- plugins/TrackExtenderWithMTD.cc\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n- src/BaseExtenderWithMTD.cc\r\n- interface/BaseExtenderWithMTD.h\r\n- plugins/TrackExtenderWithMTD.cc\r\n- plugins/TrackExtenderWithMTD.h\r\n- plugins/MuonExtenderWithMTD.cc\r\n- plugins/MuonExtenderWithMTD.h\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nA simple validation has been performed to cross-check that the code behaves as expected.

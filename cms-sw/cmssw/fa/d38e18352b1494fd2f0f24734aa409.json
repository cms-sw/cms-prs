Already, nothing was inheriting from it anymore. A few classes were still using its fillDescription function, but I moved them to use the corresponding function from the one::OutputModule and with the changes included here that function should be doing exactly the same thing.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nExisting Core unit tests pass. There is no new functionality. Nothing should change. There will just be less code to maintain.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 12, "closed_at": "1588920947", "comments": 25, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1588611238", "deletions": 698, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "core-approved", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved", "xpog-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "0d2db0024485554e802f5460a84bae0e3f2b18e2", "merged_at": "1588920947", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 29633, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Delete legacy OutputModule base class", "updated_at": "1588920947", "user": "wddgit"}

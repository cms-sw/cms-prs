Most of this code (namely the new CondTools/L1TriggerExt) was already successfully running in 2015, but few recent changes were introduced to keep up with the CondDB development. The current version handles only the highest priority uGT payload, but will soon be extended with other trigger subsystems (short PRs will follow).\n\nThis PR also requires the latest-greatest version of the external UTM library so it won't compile unless you follow the instructions at https://gitlab.cern.ch/cms-l1t-utm/utm/blob/master/README.md .\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 90, "closed_at": "1463929820", "comments": 29, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1458723781", "deletions": 370, "labels": ["alca-pending", "comparison-available", "db-rejected", "l1-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 13810, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "extendedO2O", "updated_at": "1468397230", "user": "kkotov"}

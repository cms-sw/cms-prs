Further tests performed locally showing expected behavior of the code changes--namely, when doAnd is set to true with non-zero values for cut and cutOverE specified, all resulting scouting electrons in the collection obey H < cutOverE*E + cut and the number of these electrons is reasonable.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 5, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1666121794", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["hlt-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_6_X", "number": 39762, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Add option to cut H<a+bE+cE*E", "updated_at": "1666168007", "user": "bennettgberg"}

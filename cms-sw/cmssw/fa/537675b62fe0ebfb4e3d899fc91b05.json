For expediency, we prefer to reuse existing GEN-SIM from the Phase2 Tracker TDR production, rerunning only the DIGI step. In order to have a compatible release, a change in the ME0 geometry (PR #17175) must be reverted. (The new improved ME0 geometry will be retained in CMSSW_9_1_X for further development and other future TDR productions.)\r\n\r\nattn: @rekovic, @calabria, @jshlee, @pietverwilligen, @davidlange6, @mdhildreth ", "branch": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "changed_files": 13, "closed_at": "1489563514", "comments": 19, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1489431819", "deletions": 677, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "329dfac15c2f1afcbd07ffb26522bc5f725a8695", "merged_at": "1489563514", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "number": 17911, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Revert \"Merge pull request #17175 from pietverwilligen/90X_NewME0GeometryBuilder_ForPR_v1\" (only for L1 TDR production) [90X]", "updated_at": "1489563514", "user": "kpedro88"}

I also updated some comments.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nAn existing unit test which tests getting products from ProcessBlock was extended to cover the use of GetterOfProducts. This should have no effect on any existing RelVal tests or workflows as nothing is using ProcessBlock yet outside of Framework unit tests.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1594903002", "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1594838598", "deletions": 21, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "cc657e6ee02eb169edf26c8d6f0a05a0bd2db367", "merged_at": "1594903001", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 30737, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add to GetterOfProducts support for ProcessBlock", "updated_at": "1594903002", "user": "wddgit"}

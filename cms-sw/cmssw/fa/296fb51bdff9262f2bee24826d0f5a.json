Here the optimization has been performed based on expected Run 3 conditions (but doesn't break anything if used with Run 2 conditions).\r\n\r\n A more elegant implementation is underway where these parameters would be loaded from the DB, but this will not meet the last 11_2_X pre-release deadline next Wednesday, hence the hardcoded parameters are being updated.\r\n\r\nThese parameters have been approved by the ECAL DPG. The details of derivation and validation of the same may be seen in these slides from N. Marinelli and  L.

This reduced dependencies for RECO packages using this package.\r\n- Removed poor use of inheritance\r\n- Removed the need for the ParticleTable singleton. Needed information is propagated via FSimEvent (which was already present) and ParticlePropagator (which needs the info itself).\r\n\r\nThis refactoring is the first step to proper code sharing between FastSim and RECO.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 63, "closed_at": "1552545880", "comments": 57, "commits": 18, "created_at": "1551747670", "deletions": 1021, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fastsim-approved", "generators-approved", "l1-pending", "orp-approved", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "1efe7cfb64f73c9582c25edb17822888feec4b5d", "merged_at": "1552545880", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 26061, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 9, "state": "closed", "title": "Large Refactoring of FastSim propagator", "updated_at": "1552545880", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

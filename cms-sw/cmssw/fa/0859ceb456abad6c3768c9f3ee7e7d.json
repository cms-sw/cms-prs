In my opinion, the first step to bring the ParticleFlow code under our control would be a serious refactor, which I already contributed to a little bit last year.\r\n\r\nSadly, working on the PF code is not fun at all so I didn't do that anymore, because if you try to improve something you usually break some old code. You'd also have to change this old code that is not even used anymore, which means you just waste your time. Not to mention the cognitive overhead that this old code induces if you want to understand the PF algorithms. This situation can be improved by sweeping through RecoParticleFlow and removing this unused code.\r\n\r\nSo that's what I try to do here: I removed as many files form RecoParticleFlow/PFClusterTools as possible if you still want CMSSW to compile and the matrix tests to pass.\r\n\r\nThis code included no plugins which were not used in it's own tests. Please, if you know what this code was used for or if it's still necessary, I am happy to learn about it :)\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCMSSW still compiles and local matrix tests pass.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 63, "closed_at": "1553287009", "comments": 15, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1552588270", "deletions": 5877, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "b3132cf38a407fa5cd6209eaa15cde8461c9cd0c", "merged_at": "1553287009", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 26184, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Removed unused RecoParticleFlow/PFClusterTools code", "updated_at": "1553287009", "user": "guitargeek"}

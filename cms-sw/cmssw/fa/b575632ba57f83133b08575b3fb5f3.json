The format is useful to reduce the size of HI data because the plan is to replace the strip tracker RAW data with the approximated clusters. \r\n\r\nIn this PR is included only the data format SiStripApproximateCluster and the producers to convert the SiStripCluster in SiStripApproximateCluster\r\n\r\nIn a following PR, the changes to the Reco sequence to use the approximated clusters will be added\r\n  \r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nAs of today this PR doesn't require any validation. It was tested locally using the configuration: \r\nRecoLocalTracker/SiStripClusterizer/test/step2_RAW2DIGI_L1Reco_RECO_ApproxClusters.py \r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR: \r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 11, "closed_at": "1621894829", "comments": 29, "commits": 19, "created_at": "1619533350", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "92b8b51ad0c8ee27cb02dca021e8ad6dd21528f9", "merged_at": "1621894829", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "number": 33546, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 61, "state": "closed", "title": "SiStripApproximateCluster reduced data format for HI", "updated_at": "1621894829", "user": "icali"}

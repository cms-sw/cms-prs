It is a track variable that uses the stub bend information to possibly determine quality tracks.\r\nA recent talk on the variable (including definition, implementation, and performance) can be found here: https://indico.cern.ch/event/761293/contributions/3176150/attachments/1734157/2804056/UsingStubBend.pdf\r\nThe talk explains the difference between two variables. The variable termed bendchi2, which has the best performance, has been put into the empty StubPtConsistency module, useable by the TTTrack object.\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_10_3_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1540282407", "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1540195572", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "l1-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "upgrade-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_3_X", "number": 24956, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "L1 trigger - adding stub pT consistency module", "updated_at": "1540282407", "user": "emacdonald16"}

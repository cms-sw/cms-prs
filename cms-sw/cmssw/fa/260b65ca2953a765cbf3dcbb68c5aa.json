I chose `Geometry/CommonTopologies` among the ones indicated in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/36302#issue-1067387026, but could be any other. Please confirm it's OK.\r\n2. in the same folder  `Geometry/CommonTopologies` there is also a `PixelTopology.h` file. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/131e8b49c64859fb72fbff388b62f9a7348ea6e1/Geometry/CommonTopologies/interface/PixelTopology.h#L1\r\n\r\nTo avoid confusions, this one could be named `siPixelTopology.h` or `simplePixelTopology.h` or something like that.

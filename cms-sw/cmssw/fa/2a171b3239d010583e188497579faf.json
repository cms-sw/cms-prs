Until the problem is found, we need to not do the prefetching.\r\n\r\nThe problem was seen when running on KNL for 48 or 64 threads. Reverting only this part avoids large recompilation and allows the fix to be added with only minor recompilation later.", "branch": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1487403329", "comments": 22, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1487367626", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["comparison-available", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "c00c4e87f7e8431c1e2614964b6bbba31412643d", "merged_at": "1487403329", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "number": 17556, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Revert Provenance Prefetching", "updated_at": "1487703858", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

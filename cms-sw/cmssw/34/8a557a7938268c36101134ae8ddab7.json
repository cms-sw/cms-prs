Bossini to use slide 1, not slide 3), see comments here: https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/compare/master...CTPPS:cmssw:fo_nt2_dqm_final#diff-c26415cb77d83b1dbe3bdea47ca041d0e35f6ab203364c54d92c4b143b11ce47R47\r\n\r\n[T2-map-latest-2023jun11.pdf](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/files/11715483/T2-map-latest-2023jun11.pdf)\r\n\r\nSeveral other T2 plots were also adjusted as to the T2 Digi demands used.\r\n\r\nThis PR is the final one needed for testing a special 13_0_X release for TOTEM, or possibly to be backported to 13_1_X too, see https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/41916#issuecomment-1585592026\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nAfter the inclusion of PR #41916 in master, there were no other dependent packages brought in by checkdeps , so I ran successfully a PPS workflow (1044) & the DQM test file totemt2_dqm_test_common_cfg.py , which produced the expected plots.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nThis will hopefully be backported very soon (during the coming week) to 13_0_X, and possibly later to 13_1_X, as noted above. I will submit a backport PR later with the commits from PR #41916 and the ones from this PR.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please delete the text above after you verified all points of the checklist  -->\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 4, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1686505197", "deletions": 40, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_2_X", "number": 41922, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Final DQM plot updates for the Totem T2 in the special run 25.6, to be ready for special TOTEM release testing around 12-13.6", "updated_at": "1686538610", "user": "oljemark"}

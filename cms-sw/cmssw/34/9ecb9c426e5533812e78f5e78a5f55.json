The numbering code writing the mask and reading it back was not compliant. Now the mask is written and read back with the same numbering scheme. In Run2 the mask was not used thus the bug was not spotted.\r\nWithout this fix the pixel masking can't be used.\r\n\r\nBackport to 12_4 needed.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nValidated with real Run3 data.\r\nNo changes should be seen in the tests with Run2 data/simulation. \r\n\r\n@grzanka @AndreaBellora @jpata \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1657092646", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 38606, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "PPS pixel mask Bug Fix", "updated_at": "1657093064", "user": "fabferro"}

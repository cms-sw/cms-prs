The crash there happens because we fill the `outerHitHisto` histo beyond its capacity (that is defined as `nHitsToCells = nHits * avgCellsPerHit`). The check there is only done for `maxDoublets`. Now, technically, `maxDoublets` and `nHitsToCells` should be the same (given the one-to-one correspondence between a doublet and its outer hit). Having two distinct variables arises from how the structures were defined before #47611 (one `OuterHitOfCell` array per hit). In the longer term, these two numbers should be merged. For the moment, I'm just adding a small fix to have it quickly integrated in `15_1_X` for HI operations.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nReproducer in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/49186 runs without error (and we get the warnings if `CA_WARNINGS` is defined).\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 4, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1762155503", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "bug-fix", "code-checks-pending", "tracking"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_0_X", "number": 49282, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Proper Clamping for CA Doublets Histogram", "updated_at": "1762155663", "user": "AdrianoDee"}

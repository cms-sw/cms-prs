That will allow us to study the interface between Phase-2 EMTF and Phase-2 CSC TPs with CCLUT on in all chambers.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles. I'll check a few WFs for Run-3 and Phase-2.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n@jiafulow @eyigitba @tahuang1991 ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 0, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1635417003", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["l1-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "number": 35880, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Add clones for CSC trigger primitives for Run-3 and Phase-2 with CCLUT on", "updated_at": "1635417023", "user": "dildick"}

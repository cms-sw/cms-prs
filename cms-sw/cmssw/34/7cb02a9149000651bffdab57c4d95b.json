After that, I produced a new module for producing pre- post- firing plots with a second way using eta/phi map for L1T objects (muon, jet, tau, egamma, MET) for every BX as well as for the first bunch, last bunch and isolated bunch.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 8, "closed_at": "1516827207", "comments": 47, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1514633778", "deletions": 13, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "e9a0f9f992707acb1e68d244f1ab3e6eeb455b57", "merged_at": "1516827207", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_1_X", "number": 21793, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 4, "state": "closed", "title": "Dedicated Timing Plots - New Settings for uGT and Eta/Phi Map - L1T & Online DQM", "updated_at": "1516827207", "user": "dtsitson"}

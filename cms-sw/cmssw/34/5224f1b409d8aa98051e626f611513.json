The suffixes follows the scheme: `.PU21` (given that `.21` is the suffix for `ProdLike` wfs). The missing `AVE_PU_BX_25ns` (and  `AVE_PU_BX_50ns` for consistency) scenarios have been added accordingly.\r\n \r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRunning, e.g., `*.1021`, `*.6021` and `*.8021` wfs.\r\n\r\n#### PR Backport\r\n\r\nA back-port to `12_6_X` could be useful but not mandatory.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 2, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1670316448", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["operations-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "number": 40244, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Adding Running PU Wfs", "updated_at": "1670316848", "user": "AdrianoDee"}

This update is proposed in parallel to the update of the BTL numbering scheme, that also requires the update of all references.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe following tests has been run:\r\n- Geometry/MTDCommonData/test/TestMTDIdealGeometry.cc\r\n- RecoMTD/DetLayers/test/MTDRecoGeometryAnalyzer.cc\r\n- Geometry/MTDGeometryBuilder/test/MTDDigiGeometryAnalyzer.cc\r\n- Geometry/MTDNumberingBuilder/test/GeometricTimingDetAnalyzer.cc\r\n\r\nThe result with the test is coherent with the new numbering, reference file for unit tests (https://github.com/[cms-data/Geometry-TestReference](https://github.com/cms-data/Geometry-TestReference)) needs to be updated.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 13, "comments": 7, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1734446473", "deletions": 216, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "geometry-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "upgrade-pending", "requires-external", "code-checks-approved", "tracking", "mtd", "changes-dataformats"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_0_X", "number": 46977, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "MTD Geometry - Numbering scheme update", "updated_at": "1734461955", "user": "cquarant"}

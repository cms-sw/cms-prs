I noticed events passed the DeepTau ETau path, but not the PNet path. So, I made the changes described above and shown below, after changed the corresponding filter \"by hand\" in the config to use the new filter type, ran the config again, and then observed events passing the path as expected. \r\n\r\nThis change passed the basic tests/formatting checks linked in the bottom of the PR template.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nI do not believe this PR needs to be backported since we are targeting the ParticleNet integration for the first HLT menu of 2024.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_13_3_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1703175707", "comments": 4, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1703170639", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["hlt-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_3_X", "number": 43630, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "add new filter type combination to plugins for ETau Pnet HLT path", "updated_at": "1703175708", "user": "brallmond"}

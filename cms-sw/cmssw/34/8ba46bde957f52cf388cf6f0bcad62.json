When PFTau is executed during RECO sequence, it is already loaded. Also this module is loaded with patCandidates_cff.py. However, when trying to execute PFTau only without loading the full PAT creating config, the code crashed due to this missing module.\n\nThis PR should allow simple and more intuitive re-running of PFTau. It should have no effect neither on timing or output content or size.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_2_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1407698701", "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1407497451", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "377f363c79dd2f10930e3953d1170d71cb673144", "merged_at": "1407698701", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_2_X", "number": 4910, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Including module necessary for standalone PFTau execution", "updated_at": "1407753831", "user": "jpavel"}

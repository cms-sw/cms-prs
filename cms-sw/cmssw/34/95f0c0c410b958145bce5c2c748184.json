This is targeted initially for SUSY fastsim signal production in 80x where the parameter scan is over the SUSY decay chain defined by the SLHA header, which can be inlined as part of the pythia8 configuration.\n\nThis is the (near) final implementation of the proposal discussed in https://indico.cern.ch/event/487292/contribution/15/attachments/1218978/1781280/susyscan-Jan28-2016.pdf\n\nn.b.  I consider that this is not fully tested until the changes in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmsdist/pull/2131 are in the IB and these can be properly tested together.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 17, "closed_at": "1456789110", "comments": 14, "commits": 13, "created_at": "1456180867", "deletions": 200, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "generators-approved", "orp-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 13433, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "Changes needed for SUSY parameter scans", "updated_at": "1456789110", "user": "bendavid"}

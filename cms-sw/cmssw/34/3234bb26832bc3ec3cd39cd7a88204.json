The unpacker has been added in [PR37194](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/37194). \r\nNow the EMTF shower DQM modules are enabled with unpacked info as inputs.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nTested with recent cosmic data Run 349840. The workflow runs without error. The plots for EMTF showers are empty, which is expected as there is no CSC shower input for the moment and the EMTF gives an empty shower collection.\r\nPassed unit test and matrix tests.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nN/A", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 0, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1649784414", "deletions": 15, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 37544, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Enable EMTF regional showers with unpacked info", "updated_at": "1649784433", "user": "zuoxunwu"}

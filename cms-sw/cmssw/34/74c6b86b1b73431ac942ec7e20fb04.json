This PR is made in order to reduce labels on data relvals (bold) as they seem redundant. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n1. I have tested by injecting a small set of 2018A relvals here https://dmytro.web.cern.ch/dmytro/cmsprodmon/workflows.php?campaign=CMSSW_10_6_0_pre3__data2018A_testReducedlabel-1554958645. The relvals are successfully done with the reduced string workflow names and output names.\r\n2. I have also tested with relmon system using \"manual\" pairing and it works without problem here (https://cms-pdmv.cern.ch/ReleaseMonitoring/Test_Reducedlabel/DataReport/).\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\n\r\nBefore submitting your pull requests, make sure you followed this checklist:\r\n- verify that the PR is really intended for the chosen branch\r\n- verify that changes follow [CMS Naming, Coding, And Style Rules](http://cms-sw.github.io/cms_coding_rules.html)\r\n- verify that the PR passes the basic test procedure suggested in the [CMSSW PR instructions](https://cms-sw.github.io/PRWorkflow.html)\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 14, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1554950525", "deletions": 302, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "upgrade-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 26433, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": " Reduced output string on data relvals to avoid exceed length limit", "updated_at": "1555495096", "user": "chayanit"}

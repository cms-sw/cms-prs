This PR is made in order to reduce labels on data relvals (bold) as they seem redundant. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n1. I have tested by injecting a small set of 2018A relvals here https://dmytro.web.cern.ch/dmytro/cmsprodmon/workflows.php?campaign=CMSSW_10_6_0_pre3__data2018A_testReducedlabel-1554958645. The relvals are successfully done with the reduced string workflow names and output names.\r\n2. I have also tested with relmon system using \"manual\" pairing and it works without problem here (https://cms-pdmv.cern.ch/ReleaseMonitoring/Test_Reducedlabel/DataReport/).\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1556201348", "comments": 26, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1554950525", "deletions": 302, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "pdmv-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "42f768e4c932f92ec6c38967cf3b73ab55623fb6", "merged_at": "1556201348", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 26433, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": " Reduced output string on data relvals to avoid exceed length limit", "updated_at": "1556201348", "user": "chayanit"}

When retrieved a search from the front of the list was performed, so you'd only ever get the first value entered.\n\nI've made it so that the original behavior is preserved but a complaint is generated if an overwrite is tried but not allowed (by boolean argument to the addUserFloat/Int() functions).\n\nAlso of note, the behavior of userFloat(key) and userInt(key) in the case that key does not exist has changed, both throw an exception if the key is not found.\n\nThis is a technical PR, no physics changes expected/observed in short matrix.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1444204904", "comments": 43, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1443617512", "deletions": 84, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "68dfdc61b55b7ba7b76885bbef634d1887fa09d6", "merged_at": "1444204904", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 11574, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 7, "state": "closed", "title": "Use std::lower_bound to add/search for userFloats/Ints/Cands/KinResolutions (76X)", "updated_at": "1444204904", "user": "lgray"}

Original descriptions by @VinInn \n#13959\n\n> Technical mods to ParticleFlow (and some core classes) to speedup creation for PFRecHIt and PFClusters.\n> Most of it is trivial.\n> I did not observe any regression on TTBAR PU35 reco.\n> Includes contribution by @lgray\n> \n> added major speedup in ES geometry and EcalRecHit creation\n> \n> p.s. shrink_to_fit is still calling RefCore copy constructor instead of moving as it should....\n#14070\n\n> avoid stalls due to memory fence.\n\nThe first commit (7cf0c3b) is actually from #13831. It is included here because #13959 depends on it, and the dependence is only a single commit whose intention is not to change any behaviour. The entire #13831 is not backported at this time because it causes tiny regressions due to numerics.\n#14070 is included because it depends on #13959, and causes no changes in RECO quantities.\n\nTested in CMSSW_8_0_14, no changes expected in RECO quantities in here either.\n\n@fwyzard @gennai @slava77 @VinInn @lgray \n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 33, "closed_at": "1469540432", "comments": 18, "commits": 20, "created_at": "1468992297", "deletions": 350, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-available", "core-approved", "geometry-approved", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-started"], "merge_commit_sha": "c868d6fb3aed5b39092dc3046e341f4ae01af159", "merged_at": "1469540432", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 15240, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Backport of #13959: SpeedUp ParticleFlow for HLT; and #14070: remove memory fence", "updated_at": "1469540433", "user": "makortel"}

The features have been ported to CMSSW_11_1_7.\r\n\r\n    I double checked the emulator in CMSSW_11_1_7 still gives the same level of agreement with the HLS code over 10k ttbar+200PU events\r\n\r\n    The efficiency turn on curves also look the same.\r\n\r\nRebase of https://github.com/cms-l1t-offline/cmssw/pull/883\r\n\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nRebase of https://github.com/cms-l1t-offline/cmssw/pull/883\r\n\r\nBefore submitting your pull requests, make sure you followed this checklist:\r\n- verify that the PR is really intended for the chosen branch\r\n- verify that changes follow [CMS Naming, Coding, And Style Rules](http://cms-sw.github.io/cms_coding_rules.html)\r\n- verify that the PR passes the basic test procedure suggested in the [CMSSW PR instructions](https://cms-sw.github.io/PRWorkflow.html)\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 11, "closed_at": "1620727439", "comments": 17, "commits": 11, "created_at": "1620037617", "deletions": 24, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "4d3b9f28b75b4161dc326431e4b2e2a5531fa590", "merged_at": "1620727439", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "number": 33606, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "L1T phase-2: Update to histogram (Phase-1 like) jets", "updated_at": "1620900792", "user": "cecilecaillol"}

The implementation is based on #33215. Note that the modifications include updating two files in `CalibPPS/TimingCalibration`.\r\n\r\nIt is important for us to be able to test it on Tier0 as soon as possible, so these changes are supposed to be included in CMSSW_12_1_0. Since the deadline for CMSSW_12_1_0_pre5 is 19/10, we kindly ask for a quick review.\r\n\r\nThis PR also improves `PPSAlignmentWorker` and `PPSAlignmentHarvester`. It applies a refactor, fixes some bugs and adds some new functionality to the code in the `CalibPPS/AlignmentGlobal` package. The main modifications are listed below:\r\n- huge refactor in the worker and the harvester\r\n- README update to include new parameters from the `PPSAlignmentConfiguration` conditions format\r\n- `test` folder update\r\n- Replaced `PPSAlignmentConfig` with `PPSAlignmentConfiguration` in the worker and the harvester.\r\n- Added support for the new parameters from `PPSAlignmentConfiguration`.\r\n- Now, the harvester can save an sqlite file with the alignment results.\r\n- Updated the debug mode in the harvester to save more plots.\r\n- Fixed odd fitting in the harvester (in the `yAlignment` method).\r\n\r\nApart from that, this PR adds a `RetrieveCTPPSRPAlignmentCorrectionsData` module required to properly test writing an sqlite file containing a `CTPPSRPAlignmentCorrectionsData` object.\r\n\r\nThe PR is a continuation of the strategy presented in the [AlCaDB meeting on 30 August](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1069114/). The previous PR were:\r\n- #31728 - first version of the code responsible for the PPS alignment,\r\n- #34844 and #34845 - bug fix with backport,\r\n- #35174 - new, final conditions object - `PPSAlignmentConfiguration`.\r\n\r\nThere are still some smaller changes foreseen, but they have been moved to the next PR, since it is vital to merge the PCL changes as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nThis PR also changes the online GTs, by including the new tags required in this PR and also get in line with the status of the 12_0_X currently used. Here are the diffs wrt the previous 12_1_X GTs:\r\n\r\n* [121X_dataRun3_HLT_v6](https://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/121X_dataRun3_HLT_v6/121X_dataRun3_HLT_v5)\r\n* [121X_dataRun3_Express_v6](https://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/121X_dataRun3_Express_v6/121X_dataRun3_Express_v5)\r\n* [121X_dataRun3_Prompt_v6](https://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/121X_dataRun3_Prompt_v6/121X_dataRun3_Prompt_v5)\r\n\r\nAnd the diffs wrt to the 12_0_X GTs:\r\n* [121X_dataRun3_HLT_v6](https://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/121X_dataRun3_HLT_v6/120X_dataRun3_HLT_v3)\r\n* [121X_dataRun3_Express_v6](https://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/121X_dataRun3_Express_v6/120X_dataRun3_Express_v2)\r\n* [121X_dataRun3_Prompt_v6](https://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/121X_dataRun3_Prompt_v6/120X_dataRun3_Prompt_v2)\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n- The code returns correct results running on data from Run 2. Check out `CalibPPS/AlignmentGlobal/test` for an example.\r\n- A new matrix test workflow has been added - `1042`. It does not crash, but I've observed that the harvester (4th step) does not see any plots booked by the worker (3rd step). I don't know if that's because of a faulty configuration of the relval steps or wrong command used to run it (`runTheMatrix.py -l 1042 --ibeos`). Please, let me know if you know the answer to that. If not, I can remove that matrix test from this PR. By the way, I've observed the same problem while running the workflow `1041`, which is very similar to `1042`.\r\n- To be able to run the matrix test, a candidate GT has been created - `121X_dataRun3_Prompt_Candidate_2021_10_09_12_20_39`. For now, it is still listed as `--conditions` in `relval_steps.py`. Please, let me know if I have to replace it with `auto:run3_data_express`.\r\n- In case they are needed, I attach the memory consumption plots acquired during running the procedure using a representative dataset from 2018.\r\n![alignment_memory_check](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56218578/137006760-ffaac854-e6fa-48c3-bd36-51b458cc3549.png)\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 26, "closed_at": "1634682658", "comments": 61, "commits": 13, "created_at": "1634060929", "deletions": 742, "labels": ["alca-approved", "operations-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "pdmv-approved", "db-approved", "orp-approved", "urgent", "upgrade-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "2816b39944e6e90a2aa041842c89f1b73287e093", "merged_at": "1634682658", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "number": 35631, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 26, "state": "closed", "title": "Added PPS Alignment to the Prompt Calibration Loop", "updated_at": "1634682658", "user": "MatiXOfficial"}

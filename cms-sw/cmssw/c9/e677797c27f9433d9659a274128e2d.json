This would mainly add a era modifier to decide which Scouting Glo-ParT to use.\r\n\r\nScouting Global Particle Transformer (Glo-ParT) is an inclusive tagging model for AK8 scouting PFjets. It functions as both a global tagger and a mass regression model for AK8 scouting PFjets and can also be utilized as a pre-trained model. Further details can be found in the slides.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe PR passed the tests listed at https://cms-sw.github.io/PRWorkflow.html\r\n\r\n#### Backport:\r\n\r\nBackport of PR https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/47988", "branch": "CMSSW_15_0_X", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 22, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1746014370", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "backport", "requires-external", "xpog-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_0_X", "number": 47989, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[15_0_X] Backport of #47988 (Add '22+'23 Scouting Glo-ParT Inference Facility)", "updated_at": "1746462385", "user": "yiyangzha"}

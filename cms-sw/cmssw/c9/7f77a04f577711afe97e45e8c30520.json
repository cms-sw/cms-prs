The new plots are tested via addition to existing unit tests. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe PR validation relies on the existing and new unit tests added to this PR.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\n\r\nThis PR is not a backport.\r\n\r\n**N.B.: this PR shall be put on hold until it is validated  in the development service environment.**", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 9, "closed_at": "1580217590", "comments": 12, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1579445078", "deletions": 166, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "db-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "e65f82f3d34dce4fcd114fae0e2fef357983d572", "merged_at": "1580217590", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 28761, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Payload Inspector: SiStrip Noise/Pedestals profile per module", "updated_at": "1580217803", "user": "mmusich"}

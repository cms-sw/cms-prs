The goal is to switch the default phase1 tracking to CA seeding once the duplicate rate increase is better understood (and fixed/mitigated), therefore the \"CA seeding\" is already implemented under `trackingPhase1` sub-era, and the default trackign under `trackingPhase1QuadProp` era (suggestions for better name are welcome). Full cleanup of `trackingPhase1PU70` will come later (after the pre2 dust settles).\r\n\r\nHere are MTV plots for 1000 ttbar+35PU events in 900pre1 (using 810pre16 DIGI-RAW as an input) comparing the CA seeding to the default.\r\nhttps://mkortela.web.cern.ch/mkortela/tracking/validation/CMSSW_9_0_0_pre1_caseeding/\r\nTiming decreases by ~5 % for the full trackingOnly reco job (becomes ~10 % when excluding most expensive other-than-iterative-tracking modules, mostly validation).\r\n\r\n~~The previous seeding is kept workflows 10024.[45] (full/trackingOnly), so there should be no changes between old 10024.[01] and new 10024.[45].~~ \r\n\r\n~~To minimize merge conflicts the developments are based on @ebrondol's #16858 (in the hope of getting this in pre2).~~\r\n\r\nTested in CMSSW_9_0_X_2016-11-30-2300 (rebased on top of CMSSW_9_0_X after IB CMSSW_9_0_X_2016-12-09-1100 and before the next). No changes expected in standard workflows (special 10024.[45] show the changes from `trackingPhase1PU70` to CA). ~~for phase0, phase1 changes are described above.~~ ~~and for phase2 there are changes because of #16858 (but no changes on top of that).~~\r\n\r\n@rovere @VinInn @felicepantaleo @ebrondol @mtosi ", "branch": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "changed_files": 23, "closed_at": "1481896338", "comments": 39, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1481203826", "deletions": 47, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-pending", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "744f9de58d3d644bb42b27ba93318b63397e4ac4", "merged_at": "1481896338", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "number": 16911, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 14, "state": "closed", "title": "Replace trackingPhase1PU70 workflows with CA seeding", "updated_at": "1481896338", "user": "makortel"}

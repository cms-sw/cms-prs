With Geant4 10.6 and beyond similar physics constructor exist in Geant4 library. In this PR a switch to the Geant4 class is done, which fix problem of adaptation of the new Geant4 version 10.6ref10.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes #6356 \r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nprivate\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport \r\nno\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with any link to  -->\r\n\r\nBefore submitting your pull requests, make sure you followed this checklist:\r\n- verify that the PR is really intended for the chosen branch\r\n- verify that changes follow [CMS Naming, Coding, And Style Rules](http://cms-sw.github.io/cms_coding_rules.html)\r\n- verify that the PR passes the basic test procedure suggested in the [CMSSW PR instructions](https://cms-sw.github.io/PRWorkflow.html)\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1604375130", "comments": 16, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1604350057", "deletions": 64, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "requires-external", "simulation-approved", "tests-rejected", "urgent"], "merge_commit_sha": "cdc8adf728b4bc458bbfa8e7a3a2f8219c9c5f8f", "merged_at": "1604375130", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 32009, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Switch to Geant4 thermal neutron physics", "updated_at": "1604453223", "user": "civanch"}

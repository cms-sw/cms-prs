At the same time the old ```FastTimerSD``` class, used in the very first simulation of MTD (no more available) is removed, and the corresponding production cuts and sensitive volume definitions in ```Geometry/HGCalSimData``` are deleted.\r\n\r\nThe residual dependency of ```SimG4CMS/Forward``` on DDD is concentrated in Zdc. But as far as I can see the ```ZdcShowerLibrary``` doe not really use the ```DDCompactView```  passed through the constructor, so this dependency does not look real and could be removed: @bsunanda @civanch do you agree?\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTest wf 23234.0 (scenario D49) step 1 runs smoothly providing the identical same set of Sim and Calo hits, as shown by https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/SimG4Core/Application/test/runSimHitCaloHitDumper_cfg.py", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 8, "closed_at": "1584516312", "comments": 23, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1584348596", "deletions": 230, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "e6703521713d194298669f0c4b7e466b8dabd649", "merged_at": "1584516312", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 29213, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "MTD Sensitive Detector: make it independent on DDD", "updated_at": "1584516312", "user": "fabiocos"}

The `stage2L1Trigger` sub-era component of it is currently empty, but I'm expecting trigger experts to apply the correct commands.\n\nA `Run1` era is also added.  This is foreseen as a no-operation era to help with scripting cmsDriver commands (e.g. `--era=$MY_ERA`). However, it also adds the flexibility to add customisation changes at a later date.\n\nBoth of these additions were discussed in the 20/Oct/2015 release planning meeting.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1445862302", "comments": 11, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1445419858", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["comparison-available", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "152416e05ffc4978fecba16d2b27d35c09252878", "merged_at": "1445862302", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 12023, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add eras for 2016 and Run 1", "updated_at": "1445944922", "user": "mark-grimes"}

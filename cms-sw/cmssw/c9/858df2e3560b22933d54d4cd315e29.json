In general this hit has no overlap with the cluster and the CR is not applied.\r\nThe new strategy for the case of a non-Primary particle is to search for the primary hit with same trackID and use it for the CR. In case no such hit is found, then use the first hit of the collection for that detID, as in the original strategy.\r\nThe Consequence: The new strategy allows to apply CR in more cases than with the original one -> a lower averaged value of the charge and more digis in total. But only a small fraction of the hits are impacted by this change of strategy.\r\n\r\nLatest indico presentation in Pixel offline meeting:\r\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/1000811/contributions/4410111/attachments/2265215/3846024/20210616_PRinPreparation.pdf\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nValidation of the charge profile on 100k ttbar events : \r\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/1000810/contributions/4389223/attachments/2256939/3829798/Pixel_Charge_profiles.pdf\r\n\r\nSome additional validation checks have been performed as shown in the slides, and discussed in meeting:\r\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/1000811/contributions/4410111/attachments/2265215/3846024/20210616_PRinPreparation.pdf\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1624518927", "comments": 15, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1624013763", "deletions": 55, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "31a387e0bd194f99172e89e12311e51218dd99b8", "merged_at": "1624518927", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "number": 34181, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "Change of strategy in Pixel Charge Reweighting", "updated_at": "1624518927", "user": "carolinecollard"}

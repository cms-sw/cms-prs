As is the starting pairs for triplets includes also pair `19` that does not exist (we have 19 pairs in total). This also fixes the check in the `CAGeometry` filling to properly works (that is also why this was not spotted before).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe limited matrix runs. No change expected to physics.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nIt would be good to backport this to `15_1_X`. It's not affecting the HIon HLT since there we run only quadruplets.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1760457833", "comments": 21, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1760362410", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["hlt-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "bug-fix", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved", "tracking"], "merge_commit_sha": "f76f302d64df03d80e3ba9747c1ba33679d854a5", "merged_at": "1760457833", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_16_0_X", "number": 49147, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix for `startingPairs` for Pixel Tracks CA", "updated_at": "1760457834", "user": "AdrianoDee"}

The disagreement is by far larger than the differences introduced by changing the APV shape. Also 2018 has the largest data set. That's why we can apply the new APV pulse shape for the whole Run 2.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1548275767", "comments": 15, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1548089055", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "226dc19c70063cb16b0ab0c86baa4c473c0022e3", "merged_at": "1548275767", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_5_X", "number": 25726, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add era mechanism for a new APV pulse shape for deco mode for Run 2", "updated_at": "1548275767", "user": "bourgatte"}

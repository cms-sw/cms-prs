The main purpose is to streamline the modules used for storing PF constituents information for btvNano. Another PR on revamping btvNano will soon follow.  This refactoring will also make it easier for NanoAOD private production with more constituents from other jet collections.  In the cff file,  I have added two customization functions that can be used to add AK4 and gen-jet constituents. Additionally, the GloParT `WvsQCD` binarized score is added to the `FatJet` table.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n- passes the usual runTheMatrix test: `runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos` with the exception of a few workflows which failed because of missing relval input files.\r\n- passes MiniAOD workflows: `runTheMatrix.py -i all --ibeos  -l 2500.021,2500.022,2500.023,2500.024,2500.031,2500.032,2500.033,2500.034`\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 7, "comments": 5, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1738187320", "deletions": 72, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved", "xpog-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_0_X", "number": 47206, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[JME,Nano] Refactor constituents table,  add GloParT WvsQCD score", "updated_at": "1738236664", "user": "nurfikri89"}

This is because in 101X we moved the pf cluster isolation from the pat::Electron/pat::Photon to the reco::GsfElectron/reco::Photon.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds an IO rule which fixes this and now allows PF cluster isolation of 94X produced objects to be read in 10X. \r\n\r\nNote, I couldnt figure out a better way to do this, there wasnt a good example of how to fill a base class member variable from a derived class member variable so I stuck with this simple solution, improvements are welcome. \r\n\r\nObviously this only works when reading pat::Electrons/pat::Photons, reco:GsfElectrons/reco::Photons do not have the member in 94X and therefore it cant be filled.\r\n\r\nA backport is required for 102X which I'll submit when this is mostly done.

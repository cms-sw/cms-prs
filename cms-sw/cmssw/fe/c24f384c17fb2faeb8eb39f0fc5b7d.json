Furthermore a skimming procedure is introduced for these tracks at the lite tracks format level. It allows to define a window in (absolute) time for `CTPPSDiamondLocalTrack` to be recasted to lite tracks format.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nPassed lite conversion test for arbitrary 2017 and 2018 AOD-level EDM files with diamond detectors' pots inserted.\r\n`runTheMatrix` tests still ongoing.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR: N/A\r\n\r\nBefore submitting your pull requests, make sure you followed this checklist:\r\n- [x] verify that the PR is really intended for the chosen branch\r\n- [x] verify that changes follow [CMS Naming, Coding, And Style Rules](http://cms-sw.github.io/cms_coding_rules.html)\r\n- [x] verify that the PR passes the basic test procedure suggested in the [CMSSW PR instructions](https://cms-sw.github.io/PRWorkflow.html)\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1554314115", "comments": 32, "commits": 11, "created_at": "1553526438", "deletions": 12, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "1662d47f4a2c056742e564a29425a077349235cb", "merged_at": "1554314115", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 26247, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "[PPS] Track time selector for miniAOD lite format", "updated_at": "1554314115", "user": "forthommel"}

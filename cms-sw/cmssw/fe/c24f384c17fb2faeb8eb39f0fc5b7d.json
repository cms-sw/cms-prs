Furthermore a skimming procedure is introduced for these tracks at the lite tracks format level. It allows to define a window in (absolute) time for `CTPPSDiamondLocalTrack` to be recasted to lite tracks format.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nPassed lite conversion test for arbitrary 2017 and 2018 AOD-level EDM files with diamond detectors' pots inserted.\r\n`runTheMatrix` tests still ongoing.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR: N/A\r\n\r\nBefore submitting your pull requests, make sure you followed this checklist:\r\n- [x] verify that the PR is really intended for the chosen branch\r\n- [x] verify that changes follow [CMS Naming, Coding, And Style Rules](http://cms-sw.github.io/cms_coding_rules.html)\r\n- [x] verify that the PR passes the basic test procedure suggested in the [CMSSW PR instructions](https://cms-sw.github.io/PRWorkflow.html)\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 11, "commits": 9, "created_at": "1553526438", "deletions": 10, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 26247, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[PPS] Track absolute timing selector for miniAOD lite format", "updated_at": "1553581265", "user": "forthommel"}

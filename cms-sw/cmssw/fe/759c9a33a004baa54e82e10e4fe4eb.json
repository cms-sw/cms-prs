With this change, I take the opportunity to make a simplification of the code which performs the laser monitoring charge reconstruction.  We have implemented the lasermon system in firmware rather than hardware.  This means that we can remove the complicated matching algorithm because the firmware guarantees fixed latency between channels (the hardware implementation did not).  The relevant changes are, \r\n\r\n- RecoMET/METProducers/src/HcalNoiseInfoProducer.cc : Update the adc->fC table to use qie10 ADCs\r\n- RecoMET/METProducers/src/HcalNoiseInfoProducer.cc : Update the reconstruction algorithm to simply take the first N samples of each channel where N is a new configurable parameter, laserMonitorSamples_.\r\n- RecoMET/METProducers/src/HcalNoiseInfoProducer.cc : Integrate the charge using a simple peak finding algorithm rather than integrating the whole readout\r\n-RecoMET/METFilters/plugins/HcalLaserEventFilter.cc - enable the laser filtering and update the threshold to 5000\r\n\r\nThe above changes have been tested with a recent global run for consistency against the old method and that the changes propagate to the Met filter\r\n\r\n@deguio @mariadalfonso ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 37, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1523877390", "deletions": 203, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 22974, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 6, "state": "open", "title": "Update the ADC->fC table, simplify the charge reconstruction algorith", "updated_at": "1524577775", "user": "jkunkle"}

The PR also proposes a new TrackerMTDRecoGeometryESProducer invoking this alternative build function. \r\n\r\nIt should be noted that this producer is never used in the code so this development will not produce any change in the reconstruction, but it will help us to continue doing our developments to fully integrate the MTD in the tracking.  \r\n\r\nThe code can be tested by running the TkNavigation tester: \r\n\r\nRecoTracker/TkNavigation/test/NavigationSchoolAnalyzer.cc\r\n\r\nby replacing the TrackerRecoGeometryESProducer by the TrackerMTDRecoGeometryESProducer in the configuration file:\r\n\r\nRecoTracker/TkNavigation/test/NavigationSchoolAnalyzer_cfg.py\r\n\r\nThe ideas of this PR were discussed already some time ago in several meetings: \r\n\r\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/923095/contributions/3878403/attachments/2047579/3431258/RECO-Talk-For-MTDDPGMay29.pdf\r\n\r\nA github issue was also opened to discuss about this:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/29267\r\n\r\nThanks!", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 22, "closed_at": "1618230295", "comments": 33, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1616685399", "deletions": 130, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "d13b9616294625c0c476e0abb086511edef2e3b7", "merged_at": "1618230295", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 33272, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 14, "state": "closed", "title": "Addition of the MTD to the tracker Navigation", "updated_at": "1618230296", "user": "parbol"}

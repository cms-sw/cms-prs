This PR sets this switch to `False` for the MixingModule in the `premix_stage2` modifier.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nNo validation done. Impact on physics should be small in standard workflows. However, the impact should be more substantial for 2023 MC where there are sizable holes in pixel L3 and L4 in the second part of the year.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nBackport to CMSSW_14_0_X needed to include this bugfix in Run 3 MC production\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 6, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1709234555", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["simulation-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "bug-fix", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 44276, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Bugfix for simulation of pixel bad components", "updated_at": "1709257232", "user": "ferencek"}

This is useful for private generation (or NanoGen) when the user doesn't have permission to copy to cvmfs, and when size limits prevent copying the gridpack via crab or to the cluster. In the past this has not been supported because central production cannot run like this, but it is now ensured by the request checking script that official samples are on /cvmfs, so this cannot subtly enter production\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested using private gridpack production on crab and locally", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1603451288", "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1603397203", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "generators-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "c9dad837e419070a532a4951c397bcc68f5bd095", "merged_at": "1603451288", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 31911, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add script to access gridpacks with xrdcp for ExternalLHEProducer", "updated_at": "1603451288", "user": "kdlong"}

Because its not virtual you get gems like this in the code: https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/CMSSW_10_0_0_pre2/RecoEgamma/ElectronIdentification/src/ElectronMVAEstimatorRun2Spring16GeneralPurpose.cc#L301-L306\r\n\r\nwhich is not great. So I've fixed it here and then once its merged, we can fix it in our MVA code. We also would this this backported to 94X if possible, opinons? \r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1513324121", "comments": 15, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1513240993", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "orp-approved", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "c3a2650f3dbd44c9b337a08ec297b38cef3bd001", "merged_at": "1513324121", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_0_X", "number": 21708, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fixing lack of virtualness for some GsfElectron methods", "updated_at": "1513324122", "user": "Sam-Harper"}

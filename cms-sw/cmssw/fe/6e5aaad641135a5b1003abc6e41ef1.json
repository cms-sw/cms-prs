However, while going through the config I realized some outdated options which I ended up removing. This config was already modifed to work only with L1T Stage-2 options, so there was no reason to keep around CSCTF/DTTF options.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I am changing the config for now to use unpacked muon TF inputs instead of calling muon TP re-emulation modules. This is mostly done to bypass a problem I observe in DT TP re-emulation that causes lower rates. I kept the muon TP re-emulation options in place to allow people to switch quickly between the two options. \r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with a description of the feature proposed or problem addressed, specifying:\r\n  - what changes are expected in the output if any, \r\n  - what other PRs or externals it depends upon if any,\r\n  - link to any additional material useful to provide a documentation for this PR (slides, JIRA tickets, related pull requestes, hypernews, TWiki or Indico pages)  -->\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI validated by running L1REPACK:uGT and L1REPACK:FullSimTP and comparing them. There are no crashes and the final rates are comparable up to re-emulation level mismatches. \r\n\r\nThe normal CMSSW workflows are probably no enough to check this PR, otherwise the crash would have been caught before. \r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with a description of which tests have been performed to verify the correctness of the PR, including the eventual addition of new code for testing like unit tests, test configurations, additions or updates to the runTheMatrix test workflows -->\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

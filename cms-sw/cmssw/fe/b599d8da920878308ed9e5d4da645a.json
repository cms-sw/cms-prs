For the standalone setup, an update is available in trackreco/mkFit-external#7\r\n\r\nI tested this only in the cmssw setup on ttbar PU 50 with the default field (there was some numerical difference in one track in the pixelLess iteration on 100 events; I take it as a possible compiler reoptimization case rather than some inconsistency). \r\nThere doesn't seem to be a reference MC setup with a different non-zero magnetic field.\r\n\r\n@makortel @osschar please check (others are welcome to comment as well)", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 24, "closed_at": "1654613101", "comments": 2, "commits": 10, "created_at": "1654612391", "deletions": 101, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-rejected"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 38275, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "take magnetic field scale from GT in mkFit", "updated_at": "1654613102", "user": "slava77"}

(BX - capid) % 4 should be a constant.\r\n- Monitor uHTR-L1T mismatches. This is copied straight from the L1T DQM code, but it's extremely useful for HCAL.\r\n\r\nMinor additions:\r\n- Add LED pin diode plots to local DQM.\r\n- UMNioTask now handles LED events correctly, instead of labeling them HF.\r\n- Implement code rule check as suggested by Fabio. These were all \"using namespace * in header\" violations, which were fairly ubiquitous in the HcalCommon infrastructure.", "branch": "CMSSW_10_1_X", "changed_files": 55, "comments": 8, "commits": 50, "created_at": "1525385532", "deletions": 426, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_1_X", "number": 23141, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "HCALDQM: Monitor bad capid rotation, uHTR/L1T mismatches (10_1_X)", "updated_at": "1525772634", "user": "DryRun"}

This is mostly relevant for Run3, i.e. Phase1 tracker geometry, where outer-tracker coverage ends soon after |eta|=2.5. In this PR, we are stopping to propagate these relaxation of cuts to Phase2, because phase2 outer-tracker has much better eta coverage, and thus the electrons would be eta-extended anyway. \r\n\r\nIt was found in validation that, in phase2 the relaxation of cuts actually does more harm than good in very high PU scenario. \r\nLink: Slide 13 of https://indico.cern.ch/event/1085302/contributions/4563231/attachments/2332176/3974663/Release_Validation_Report_2021_10_21.pdf\r\n  \r\nThis PR aims to solve that issue. \r\n\r\nThis PR should not have any effect on Run3 (or Run2), the only effect is expected in Phase2. The effect should be visible only in high PU scenario.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n`runTheMatrix.py -l 34834.999` ran fine. It is Phase2 ttbar with PU=50.\r\nThen analysed its output AOD file, and compared some quantities before(in red) and after(in blue) this PR. \r\n\r\n1) `numberOfValidHits()` in GSF tracks from collection `Handle(\"vector<reco::GsfTrack>\"), \"electronGsfTracks\"`.  As expected, after this PR there is no GSF track with nhit<5.\r\n<img width=\"450\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-10-28 at 18 01 31\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5052706/139293542-8ec2e064-a0b4-4b7d-b52b-2ba43dc03e25.png\">\r\n\r\n2) eta of electron from the collection `Handle(\"vector<reco::GsfElectron>\"), \"ecalDrivenGsfElectronsHGC\"`.

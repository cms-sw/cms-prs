The second criterion is not applied for  muon seeded tracks since they were assumed the same with iteration 0\n\nNew algorithm:\n-Track goes to PF if it belongs to a muon with at least a global refit with Dpt/pt<1 or if Dpt/pt <N HCAL resolution with N=5.\n\nSince this changes implies differences in the configuration files and since HLT is not affected by this [suing other iterations ] I exploited the modular nature of the BLOCK Algo to copy the old importer to a new one and use the new one in the offline cfi file. So while code changes look to be a lot the change is really minimal.\n\nFor validation plots see my talk in PPD 23/09/2015\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1445354264", "comments": 16, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1443011178", "deletions": 42, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "1b9453b26c3007eb2cc17a18026a2d716e8c0959", "merged_at": "1445354264", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 11433, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Improvements in track quality criteria in PF for muon seeded iterations", "updated_at": "1445354264", "user": "bachtis"}

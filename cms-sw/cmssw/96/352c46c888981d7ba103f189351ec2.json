In case of interest to reuse some functionalities of the package, e.g. fits of 3-prongs taus to a1 mass, one will need anyhow to write new modules (maybe recycling part of removed code from git archives). \r\n\r\nThis PR addresses issue https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/37974.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nChecked that headers from the package are not used anywhere in CMSSW and that modules defined there are not part of any official workflow (they would not run).\r\n\r\nRepresentative matrix test no. 10024.0 (TTbar_13+2017+TTbar_13TeV_TuneCUETP8M1_GenSimINPUT+Digi+RecoFakeHLT+HARVESTFakeHLT+ALCA+Nano) successful. \r\nThe \"limited\" set of matrix tests is ongoing - the PR description will be updated when they finish.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 32, "comments": 0, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1652963316", "deletions": 3113, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 38016, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Removal of obsolete RecoTauTag/ImpactParameter package", "updated_at": "1652963336", "user": "mbluj"}

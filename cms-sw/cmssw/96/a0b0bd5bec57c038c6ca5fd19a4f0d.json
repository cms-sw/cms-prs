However, with the new changes to the build process and deployment via cmsdist, these files can be removed again (as done in this PR). Instructions on how to locally AOT compile and use models for development purposes will be published on pages of the ML group soon.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation\r\n\r\nSince the pre-compiled test models are now provided as external tools, this PR enables the unit tests of the AOT interface that were already reviewed. They perform tests of a simple f32 -> f32 model, as well as a multi-input/output model with a f32,f64 -> f32,bool signature.\r\n\r\n@Bogdan-Wiederspan @valsdav ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 9, "comments": 4, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1711124309", "deletions": 920, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending", "ml-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 44519, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Enable TensorFlowAOT unit tests, remove dev workflow.", "updated_at": "1711528978", "user": "riga"}

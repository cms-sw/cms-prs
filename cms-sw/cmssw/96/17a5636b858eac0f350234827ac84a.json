New monitoring elements are added to layer-1 DQM for the 3x6x32 bits. The modification is done in such a way that it works before and after the card addition (current firmware and new firmware not yet uploaded).\r\n\r\nNote that the monitoring elements for HCAL FB4-5 are commented out, we will put them back once HCAL fixes them (FB4-5 are reserved bits and not used for LLP, but they are sending unphysical data there which layer-1 could not read out, causing discrepancies seen when comparing them).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nValidated by running offline DQM on past commissioning runs, it works as expected for current production firmware. It needs to be tested with new firmware not yet deployed at P5.", "branch": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "changed_files": 5, "comments": 13, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1682076810", "deletions": 63, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "l1-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "number": 41383, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "add layer-1 monitoring for new slot-7 cards [13_0_3 P5 DQM test]", "updated_at": "1686307969", "user": "hftsoi"}

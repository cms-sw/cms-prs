The method builds a graph consisting of tracks and their surrounding tracksters, and then uses a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to evaluate whether each track-trackster edge is valid. Tracksters that are predicted to be linked to a given track are then stored accordingly.\r\n\r\nIn the current implementation, the linking selection is prioritized using the track pT and the DeltaR between the track and tracksters. This strategy may be refined in the future for further optimization.\r\n\r\nA new procmodifier has been added to enable this method in workflows *.211. The process modifier is named ticlv5_TrackLinkingGNN.\r\n\r\nThis PR should be tested with TICL workflows such as 29888.211 and 29688.211, using the GNN models uploaded here:\r\nhttps://github.com/cms-data/RecoHGCal-TICL/pull/11\r\n\r\nAdding : @felicepantaleo @hatakeyamak @waredjeb @AuroraPerego", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 9, "comments": 5, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1765961088", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "hlt-pending", "operations-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "tests-started", "requires-external", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_0_X", "number": 49652, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "GNN Track-Tracksters Linking in TICLv5", "updated_at": "1765961745", "user": "Moanwar"}

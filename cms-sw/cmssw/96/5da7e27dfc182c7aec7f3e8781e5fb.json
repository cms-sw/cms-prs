Corresponding updates within PFAlgo, some improvements still to be made, small poorly calibrated cluster fragments are produced too often and correspond to overproduction of PFPhotons. There are also still some issues of linking HGC clusters to tracks that cause double counting in PF.\n\nWorking on these issues presently. This PR can be used in production to generate reasonable baselines.\n\n@pfs @vandreev11 \n", "branch": "CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "changed_files": 24, "closed_at": "1421134364", "comments": 11, "commits": 31, "created_at": "1421006034", "deletions": 221, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "0032370838e21b7c9b3d6d463fa186b8f48908a5", "merged_at": "1421134364", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "number": 7125, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "HGC EM + Hadronic Merged Clustering", "updated_at": "1421134364", "user": "lgray"}

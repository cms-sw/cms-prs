Then all popped blocks are pushed back to the queue.\r\n\r\nUse atomic operations for the individual statistics.\r\nAccess to the whole set of statistics may not be fully consistent, but they should only be used for debugging or monitoring.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nValidated on top of CMSSW 14.0.x with the 2024 HLT menu.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "comments": 3, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1731326494", "deletions": 417, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-rejected", "heterogeneous-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_2_X", "number": 46658, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Make the caching memory allocator lock-free", "updated_at": "1731326694", "user": "fwyzard"}

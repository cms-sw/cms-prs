Once that's available it would be desirable to have that run centrally for all the paths (via `HLTBeginSequence` as currently done in the Run 3 menu) instead of letting the individual clients include it. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nStandard TSG integration tests\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

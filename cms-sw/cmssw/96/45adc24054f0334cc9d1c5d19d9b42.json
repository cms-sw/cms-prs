In order to use reclustered jets from jet flavour ID one would need to replace the input genJets collections in the PhysicsTools/JetMCAlgos/python/sequences/GenHFHadronMatching_cff.py sequences.\n\nA very simple test config file has been added: PhysicsTools/JetMCAlgos/test/genHFHadronMatcher.py\n\nIt doesn't produce any input since this would need to write information into some ROOT file. It just checks whether the algorithm runs in the particular release.\n\nThis code has been tested to compile and run in CMSSW_7_1_6 release on lxplus0185.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_2_X", "changed_files": 8, "closed_at": "1408950404", "comments": 11, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1407877568", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "comparison-pending", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "d332fbde308500fd69d188e486eb7a5cbc8e8607", "merged_at": "1408950404", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_2_X", "number": 4934, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 14, "state": "closed", "title": "Generator level heavy flavour jet origin/flavour identification", "updated_at": "1414358543", "user": "bartosik-hep"}

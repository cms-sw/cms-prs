This follows the style of the pp code.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1423895577", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1423690297", "deletions": 84, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "14eb497503c8313b5edd3caaf5b5e6e355786911", "merged_at": "1423895576", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 7686, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Cluster cleaning bug fix, renamed hiSecond to hiLowPt", "updated_at": "1423895577", "user": "mandrenguyen"}

The PR contains the following changes:\r\n* Add default values for configurable parameters where those have not been set to allow correct parsing to ConfDB;\r\n* Allow a pass-through at L2 for all L1 taus with pt above a configurable threshold in L2NNTauTag to avoid observed drop of efficiency for taus with gen_vis_pt > 500 GeV (for gen_vis_pt < 500 GeV the algo efficiency is above 90%). We estimated that the rate with the pass-though threshold of 250 GeV (default) does not significantly change: for the 3 kHz Working Point (WP) it goes from 2999.7 Hz to 3026.4 Hz (0.9%); changes are similar for other WPs.\r\n\r\nThe changes are simple fixes and do not change behavior of the modules, but on the other hand are critical as without them L2Tau CNN and deepTauID cannot be deployed at HLT.\r\n\r\nWe plan a backport to 12_1_X as soon as this PR is accepted. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nStandard tests passed\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 9, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1636123221", "deletions": 19, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "hlt-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_2_X", "number": 36009, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 7, "state": "open", "title": "Fixes to L2Tau CNN and deepTauID for HLT", "updated_at": "1636215914", "user": "mbluj"}

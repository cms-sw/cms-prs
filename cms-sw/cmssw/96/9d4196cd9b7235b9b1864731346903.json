We alter the way the noises vector is extended, since it uses the `isNose_` member variable before the variable is set, while the `insert` method should not be called using iterators that refer to the very same vector we are trying to extend.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nNo difference is observed to the printout information. \r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nNot a backport.

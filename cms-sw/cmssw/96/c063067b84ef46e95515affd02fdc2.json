I am doing a physics analysis in PbPb of studying the DDbar delta_phi correlation.  For my analysis I need an official MC of only events containing at least 2 D0->k,pi decays\r\n  - in the PR I added a specific filter that only permits events with at least 2 decays of D0->k,pi \r\n  - `PhysicsTools/GenFilters/plugins/GenD0PairToKPiFilter.cc`\r\n  - it does not depend on other PR or externals\r\n  - as far as I could tell the existing CMSSW filters are not compatible with requiring pairs\r\n  - to be clear, this filter (and PR) will be used when I request the official MC\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI produced 3M+ events with this filter according to the GEN/SIM steps and wrote a python script that analyzes all the outputted events to ensure that all of them  do, in fact, have at least 2 instances of D0->k,pi\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1765829412", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "new-package-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "number": 49635, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Added GenD0ToKPiFilter for Official MC Request for DDbar in PbPb analysis", "updated_at": "1766002601", "user": "a-wesole"}

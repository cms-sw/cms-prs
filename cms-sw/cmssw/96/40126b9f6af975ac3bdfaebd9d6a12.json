These wfs were using the `HIon` HLT menu, which, after this PR, is not compatible anymore with the L1T menu in `auto:phase1_2018_realistic_hi`.\r\n\r\nThis is the PR for the `master` branch, which will then be backported to `12_5_X` and `12_4_X` (the latter is the release cycle currently used for HLT-menu development for Run 3).\r\n\r\nIt also includes 9f0a4652aca, which changes of the frozen `GRun` menu in `12_6_X` from \"V1.4\" to \"V1.5\"; this change will not be backported (the `GRun` frozen menus in `12_4_X` and `12_5_X` remain unchanged).\r\n\r\nThis PR includes the integration of the following JIRA tickets.\r\n\r\n  - [CMSHLT-2366](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSHLT-2366): [BTV] disable DeepCSV triggers of GRun\r\n  - [CMSHLT-2476](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSHLT-2476): [TSG] seed of `HLT_EphemeralZeroBias` changed to `L1_ZeroBias_copy`\r\n  - [CMSHLT-2478](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSHLT-2478): [MUO] removed some HLT-muon modules from `suppressWarning` list\r\n  - [CMSHLT-2491](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSHLT-2491): [TSG] update PSs of `HLT_HT300_Beamspot` trigger\r\n  - [CMSHLT-2495](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSHLT-2495): [TSG] update PSs of Ephemeral triggers\r\n  - [CMSHLT-2497](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSHLT-2497): [TSG] added L1T seed to `HLT_EphemeralPhysics` (L1A Physics \"masking\" `L1_ZeroBias_copy`)\r\n  - [CMSHLT-2499](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSHLT-2499): [TSG] added `L1_SingleTau130er2p1` to L1T seeds using `L1_SingleTau120er2p1`\r\n  - [CMSHLT-2501](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSHLT-2501): [EXO] added L1Tau-seeded delayed-jet triggers\r\n  - [CMSHLT-2514](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSHLT-2514): [TSG] disable two displaced-dijet and two PNET triggers\r\n  - [CMSHLT-2518](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSHLT-2518): [HIG] update of 1 L1T seed and 2 PSs of MSSM-Hbb control triggers\r\n  - [CMSHLT-2519](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSHLT-2519): [TSG] disable 4 fatjet softdrop-mass triggers plus other PS changes\r\n  - [CMSHLT-2520](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSHLT-2520): [BTV] updated PSs of `BTagMu` triggers\r\n  - [CMSHLT-2521](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSHLT-2521): [HIN] update of HIon sequences for RawPrime repacking\r\n  - [CMSHLT-2523](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSHLT-2523): [HIN] removed outdated HIon triggers\r\n  - [CMSHLT-2527](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSHLT-2527): [EXO] updated L1T seed of `SingleLLPJet` triggers\r\n  - [CMSHLT-2532](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSHLT-2532): [HIN] update of Streams/PDs/EventContents for HIon 2022 test run\r\n  - [CMSHLT-2534](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSHLT-2534): [JME] doubled PS of `AlCa_*PFJet*` triggers\r\n  - [CMSHLT-2535](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSHLT-2535): [HIN] updated L1T seeds of HIUPC triggers\r\n  - [CMSHLT-2537](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSHLT-2537): [TSG] sync PSs of offline menu with V1.4.5 online menu\r\n  - [CMSHLT-2539](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSHLT-2539): [TSG] use common PF-scouting sequence in `MC_Run3_PFScoutingPixelTracking_v` Path\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTSG tests.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

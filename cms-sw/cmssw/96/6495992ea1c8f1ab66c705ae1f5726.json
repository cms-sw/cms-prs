The secondary one, called the trigger cache, is used only in unusual circumstances.  However, in the multithreaded environment, having the trigger cache enabled can cause occasional fatal asserts due to a yet undiscovered bug in its implementation.  Since there is doubt that the trigger cache is useful in a multithreaded environment, this pull request simply disables it for now. This eliminates the asserts.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_THREADED_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1388756957", "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1388704625", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "4165d7c127b34f0a9407d5a8adcd2b2f11fa41dd", "merged_at": "1388756957", "merged_by": "ktf", "number": 1939, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Disable the triggerCache in the multithreaded environment.", "updated_at": "1389065455", "user": "wmtan"}

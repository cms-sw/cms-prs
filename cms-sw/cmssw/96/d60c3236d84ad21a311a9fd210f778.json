This logic is not in the firmware on detector, so this PR causes the software to match the firmware on-detector. This discrepancy between off-detector software and the on-detector firmware was discovered during an HCAL conditions update last week and a detailed discussion about it can be found in the [L1 JIRA ticket](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSLITDPG-1082)\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nA basic technical test was performed: runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nThis PR is not a backport", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1669646674", "deletions": 8, "labels": ["l1-pending", "alca-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "number": 40165, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "HCAL: Remove the MIP fine grain bit logic from the HCAL endcap", "updated_at": "1669654630", "user": "Michael-Krohn"}

I'm lazy so used the static methods as done elsewhere in the digitizers. One can easily also make the RandPoissonQ object a member data with the same effect. RandPoissonQ does some setup assuming that the mu its given will be used over and over, so there is a CPU penalty for creating it and using it only once.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1427394857", "comments": 17, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1427010151", "deletions": 22, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "fully-signed", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "7d5539d59ca9c3b8482d0ae9456835213552fe00", "merged_at": "1427394857", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 8450, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "avoid copies of GenEvent and optimizing random number usage in DIGI step", "updated_at": "1427394857", "user": "davidlange6"}

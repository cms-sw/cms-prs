Only the RefToBase were used internally and\nexternally. However, the RefToBase were filled from the Ref as needed.\nTherefore I dropped the Refs and instead fill the RefToBase from the\nRefs in the appropriate constructors. This means the vector of RefToBases\ndoes not have to be mutable and therefore the object is thread-safe.\n\nAdded a ROOT I/O rule which allows reading back the old format which\nhas the Refs in the case where only the Refs were ever filled.\n\nAlso changed order of member data so the compiler no longer had to add\npadding between the member data.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1384119903", "comments": 7, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1383516990", "deletions": 50, "labels": ["fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "6daab9692e645a05d51e823cbc21a72829f36d39", "merged_at": "1384119903", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_0_0_pre9", "number": 1305, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Made Conversion thread-safe and smaller in memory and storage", "updated_at": "1384437405", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

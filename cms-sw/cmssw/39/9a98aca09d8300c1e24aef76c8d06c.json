This adds two new collections: slimmedOOTPhotons, slimmedOOTPhotonCores. The associated clusters, SCs, and ecal rec hits are added into the reducedEgamma collections.\r\n\r\nThe file size increase was estimated in the same way as 18844, using 1000 events from a single 2016H SinglePhoton raw file: /store/data/Run2016H/SinglePhoton/RAW/v1/000/284/035/00000/0A2C49D0-E29E-E611-92CB-02163E0142E4.root.\r\n\r\nAdding up the size of the new collections and increases to related collections with edmEventSize -v, the uncompressed size increase is 1.4 kB / event, while the compressed size increase is 415.3 kB / event.  Simply doing ls -l, taking the difference between vanilla sequence and this sequence, the increase in size is 260.5 B / event.\r\n\r\nBoth this PR and 18844 were tested in 9_2_0_patch1 with signal MC produced in 90X (GMSB displaced photons, ctau = 6000mm) with 100 events.

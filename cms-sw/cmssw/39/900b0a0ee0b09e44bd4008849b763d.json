I hope that this will be merged relatively soon so that this PR and fixes for 75X data don't interfere with each other.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 10, "closed_at": "1437282103", "comments": 21, "commits": 12, "created_at": "1433881136", "deletions": 88, "labels": ["alca-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "3d45a0a3864a0c9b0875ca6e19c63013e3d1b03f", "merged_at": "1437282103", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 9532, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "More All-In-One tool improvements", "updated_at": "1437331187", "user": "hroskes"}

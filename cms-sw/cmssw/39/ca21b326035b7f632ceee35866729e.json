Small refinements added (such as suppressing phase 0 pixel validation output in phase 1 pixel era) and the recent DQM client changes (as the code inherits from the phase 1 pixel DQM framework).\r\n\r\nAdded validation modules for the phase 1 pixel code based off the phase 1 dqm framework. Replicates the functionality of the phase 0 code, namely:\r\n\r\nDigis\r\nHits\r\nRecHits\r\nTrack Clusters\r\nTracking MC Truth (referred to as TrackingParticle in the phase 1 validation directory structure)\r\nValidation/Configuration/python/globalValidation_cff.py; Validation/Configuration/python/postValidation_cff.py;\r\nand Validation/Configuration/python/trackerSimValid_cff.py; have been modified so that if the era is phase1Pixel, the new validation code is used.\r\n\r\nWhen in the phase 1 pixel era, the phase 0 pixel validation output is disabled. The phase0 validation has been kept in for cases where it may be needed in the future (such as a new rereco).\r\n\r\n@fioriNTU @lunik1 @ckmackay - you might be interested in this.\r\n\r\n@davidlange6 - I know you'll be be wanting to know how many histogram bins are added. I'll get that number to you soon.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 32, "closed_at": "1497951399", "comments": 13, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1497016229", "deletions": 55, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "new-package-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_9_2_X", "number": 19175, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Phase 1 Pixel Validation code for CMSSW_9_2_X to replace Phase 0 Pixel Validation code for Phase 1 Pixel era.", "updated_at": "1497951399", "user": "davidcarbonis"}

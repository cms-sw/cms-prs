This will be fixed in a future PR.\n\nThe full matrix was run and showed only 3 failing workflows with errors unrelated to the conditions.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "changed_files": 30, "closed_at": "1403101198", "comments": 16, "commits": 27, "created_at": "1401977905", "deletions": 199, "labels": ["alca-approved", "comparison-pending", "dqm-approved", "hlt-rejected", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_7_1_0", "number": 4125, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "move to use new conditions DB (71x branch)", "updated_at": "1403101198", "user": "apfeiffer1"}

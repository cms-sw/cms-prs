As this\nis the thread which caused the SEGV in the first place, it made the\nsigstack printer less-than-useful.\n\nWe were not able to identify why it worked with the CLONE_VFORK in\nsome cases.\n\nFurther, we observed that instances exiting with SEGV/BUS/ILL always\nreturned exit status 134 (SIGABRT).  This rethrows the signal in\norder to get the correct exit status.\n\n(cherry picked from commit 0ad1c49696730150d9115c912de775e6653285e1)\n\nForward port from 7_4_x\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1440079294", "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1440072890", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "tests-started"], "merge_commit_sha": "818cccb6f53613e514c9a86627c8a4a0ded15754", "merged_at": "1440079294", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 10886, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix sigstack printer.", "updated_at": "1440082038", "user": "bbockelm"}

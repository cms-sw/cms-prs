Unfortunately the amount of code to modify is, as usual, enormous and residing mostly in non critical areas. So I suspect we have just to live with it.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_2_X", "changed_files": 43, "closed_at": "1408618973", "comments": 21, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1408034032", "deletions": 301, "labels": ["alca-pending", "comparison-available", "fastsim-approved", "geometry-approved", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved", "visualization-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "850ea65ec90c651bf71b0e68562c114d88bdf782", "merged_at": "1408618973", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_2_X", "number": 4947, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "Tracker geom det", "updated_at": "1492768346", "user": "VinInn"}

This PR adds `DDExtrudedPolygon`, `DDPolycone`, and `DDPolyhedra`. These new classes are implemented in a new way that avoids any data members.\r\n\r\nAfter these new classes are put to use, if it becomes clear that their implementation is superior to the implementation of the older shapes, a follow-up PR can be done to re-implement the older shapes in the new way.\r\n\r\nNote that with the new shapes, the calling code must ensure that the matching type of solid is passed to the constructor; otherwise, a run-time exception could occur when a shape method is called.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nA new unit test is added that exercises each of the shapes. For each kind of shape, a detailed comparison is made to reference values to ensure that the parameters are being read out correctly. In this PR, some of the reference XML files were slightly revised to eliminate degenerate parameter values and facilitate robust testing.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": "1598454033", "comments": 45, "commits": 8, "created_at": "1595873127", "deletions": 20, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "geometry-rejected", "hold", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 30931, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "Add DDExtrudedPolygon, DDPolycone, and DDPolyhedra shapes for reading shape parameters", "updated_at": "1598454033", "user": "cvuosalo"}

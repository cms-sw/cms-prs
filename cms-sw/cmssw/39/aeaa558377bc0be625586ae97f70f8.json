The CheckETLstructure method performs a detailed analysis of the ETL detector geometry by counting the number of LGAD detectors based on their geographical location: by physical disk and Z-side (e.g., Disc 1 Z, Disc 2 Z), by Disc Side and Sector as defined in the ETLDetId, and by predefined eta bins ([1.5,2.1),[2.1,2.5),[2.5,3.0]).\r\n\r\nPR validation:\r\nThe validation code was tested with a TTBar_PU_200 sample, using the CMSSW_15_1_0_pre6 release. The validation of the MTDDigiGeometryAnalyzer ensures the geometrical configuration of the ETL meets the expected layout requirements (for D110, D118 and D119 scenarios).", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 19, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1760430658", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["geometry-pending", "dqm-approved", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_0_X", "number": 49158, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "ETL occupancy study", "updated_at": "1760632401", "user": "rdelliga"}

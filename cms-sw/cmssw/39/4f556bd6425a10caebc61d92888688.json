It was automatically forward ported from the main 7_2_X branch, but is not needed here.\nPlease merge promptly, unless there are issues.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_2_ROOT6_X", "changed_files": 43, "closed_at": "1402937228", "comments": 0, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1402937005", "deletions": 106, "labels": [], "merge_commit_sha": "957dc884c513cbef27a7da38b377e3bd2abc1195", "merged_at": "1402937228", "merged_by": "ktf", "number": 4279, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Remove shared ptr workarounds", "updated_at": "1402939641", "user": "wmtan"}

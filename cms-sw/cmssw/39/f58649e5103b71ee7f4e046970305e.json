It is now migrated to 91X accordingly. It contains code clean-up work to improve the work flow of tau reconstruction as such and the maintainability of the code. This part had been split off from other technical changes since with this PR we do expect small changes in the validation workflows. I'm citing comments from Michal and refer to him to comment on further questions. \r\n\r\nExpected changes:\r\n * Small differences in outputs of all algorithms/discriminants using tau vertex position to filter PFChargedCandidates,\r\n * Disappearing of impact parameters and flight lengths with very (incorrect) big significance thanks to change of Algorithm in configuration of PFTauPrimaryVertexProducer from 1 (useFrontPV, i.e. veretx[0]) to 0 (useInputPV, i.e. vertex associated to tau). In a consequence some changes in output of MVAIsolation discriminant are expected with small change of performance (improvement!)\r\n\r\nStandard tests do not reveal any problems beyond the expected changes. \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nRoger", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 9, "closed_at": "1491841057", "comments": 12, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1491470910", "deletions": 79, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "8df51b6afd1583cc21585eedfe1fb46f670bb1cf", "merged_at": "1491841057", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_1_X", "number": 18243, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fixes and developments to improve tau veretx association", "updated_at": "1510909342", "user": "roger-wolf"}

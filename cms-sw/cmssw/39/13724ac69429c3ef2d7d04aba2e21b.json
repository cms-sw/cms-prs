The relevant information can be obtained directly from the DDCompactView or Views derived from it. This matches what is being done in the dd4hep migration.\r\n\r\nThis is needed to support concurrent EventSetup module running (and we've just been lucky it hasn't hurt us up to this point).\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe code compiles. I don't know how to test this. The change should be strictly technical with not change in behavior.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 14, "closed_at": "1591334183", "comments": 34, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1591035604", "deletions": 113, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "ae40f9f461ab323a25c798728e99fbdfea645e1a", "merged_at": "1591334183", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 30069, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 19, "state": "closed", "title": "Removed usage of DDVectorGetter from production code", "updated_at": "1591334184", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

The name \"EtaPhiRegion\" was already taken by a struct defined in ```RecoEgamma/EgammaHLTProducers/interface/HLTCaloObjInRegionsProducer.h```. Therefore, in order to avoid possible duplicates, I opted to \"RectangularEtaPhiRegion\".\r\n\r\nComments about the name and the position of the moved package are welcome.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 31, "comments": 6, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1520937059", "deletions": 91, "labels": ["alca-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "dqm-approved", "geometry-pending", "hlt-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-started"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_1_X", "number": 22593, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Move eta phi region from reco egamma to math", "updated_at": "1520944737", "user": "perrotta"}

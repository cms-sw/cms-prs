The name \"EtaPhiRegion\" was already taken by a struct defined in ```RecoEgamma/EgammaHLTProducers/interface/HLTCaloObjInRegionsProducer.h```. Therefore, in order to avoid possible duplicates, I opted to \"RectangularEtaPhiRegion\".\r\n\r\nComments about the name and the position of the moved package are welcome.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 31, "closed_at": "1522127635", "comments": 17, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1520937059", "deletions": 91, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "hlt-approved", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "60421ce07362a6f24c39ba286741ea6d69598353", "merged_at": "1522127635", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_1_X", "number": 22593, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Move eta phi region from reco egamma to math", "updated_at": "1522127635", "user": "perrotta"}

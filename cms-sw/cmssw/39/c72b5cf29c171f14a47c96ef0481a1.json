Since elastic scattering is used for CTPPS calibration (alignment, optics), many of the new plots are of general interest for CTPPS.\r\n\r\nWe would like to test the code in online DQM on 8 Nov 2017 when the machine plans a test run at 900 GeV. That's why this backport has been prepared. Some code refinements may occur after the test run.\r\n\r\nThe code has been prepared such that the new plots can be easily disabled - by removing this python config line:\r\nhttps://github.com/jan-kaspar/cmssw/blob/dqm_rp_elastics/DQM/CTPPS/python/ctppsDQM_cff.py#L19\r\n\r\nThis PR can be tested with\r\nhttps://github.com/jan-kaspar/cmssw/blob/dqm_rp_elastics/DQM/CTPPS/test/elastic_dqm_test_cfg.py\r\nwhich uses data from a CTPPS alignment run (July 2017) where also vertical RPs were inserted. A similar Roman Pot configuration is expected for the 900 GeV data.\r\n\r\nBeyond the new DQM modules, this PR makes a minor change to the RP geometry: verticals in unit 220-fr are placed in a similar distance from beam as other vertical RPs.", "branch": "CMSSW_9_2_X", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1513937578", "comments": 16, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1509736071", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "orp-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_9_2_X", "number": 21161, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "DQM plots for elastic scattering in 900 GeV run (backport of #21158)", "updated_at": "1513937579", "user": "jan-kaspar"}

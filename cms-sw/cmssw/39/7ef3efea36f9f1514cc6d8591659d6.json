The dataset is also automatically skimmed to include only the run and the lumis from the latest and greatest Golden data certification json;\r\n\r\n2. a fix to the fact that  the `InputInfo` class, while accepting as input a variable `events` does not really use it to skim the result of the das query. It's only really used in a [log](https://github.com/AdrianoDee/cmssw/blob/1d62219e28a38c574b9cc9af52ec07d34ab5303e/Configuration/PyReleaseValidation/python/MatrixReader.py#L389). I find it ambiguous and a bit confusing. In practice it also means that for 2023 and 2022 RelVals we have been running on O(few millions) events per pre-release (see e.g. [CMSSW_14_1_0_pre3__Data_Run3_2023_Data-RunEGamma2023D](https://cms-pdmv-prod.web.cern.ch/relval/relvals?prepid=CMSSW_14_1_0_pre3__Data_Run3_2023_Data-RunEGamma2023D-00001&shown=1082367&page=0&limit=50)). While this is nice in terms of being able to do that (kudos on computing!) it usually slows down a lot the RelVal production. This leverages on the script introduced in (1).\r\n\r\n3. the addition of 2024 data RelVals for Eras from B to F as `standard` wfs with `2024.*` prefix. These are run with:\r\n   - `Run3_2024` era; \r\n   - `HLT:@relval2024` (currently pointing at GRun);\r\n   - running on 50k events using the script in (1) and the script in (2)\r\n\r\n4. a new set of RelVals under `relvals_data_highstats.py` that should include all the higher statistics data RelVals workflows with 150k,250k,500k and 1M events. For the moment it includes only the 2024 wfs. This set is not turned on by default to avoid to have an over crowded matrix.\r\n\r\nAll the needed input RAW samples have been copied via Rucio at `T2_CH_CERN`.\r\n \r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRunning (e.g.) `runTheMatrix.py -w data,standard -l 12024.003015, 2024.00405, 2024.007005, 2024.0091, 2024.012005, 2024.013025, 2024.10305, 2024.108005, 2024.108015, 2024.210025, 2024.211015, 2024.2111, 2024.212025, 2024.213015, 2024.214025, 2024.21405, 2024.303015, 2024.310025, 2024.31305, 2024.3141, 2024.400005, 2024.402015`", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 7, "comments": 67, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1716809918", "deletions": 19, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "tests-rejected", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 45055, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "2024 Data RelVals and `InputInfo` Events Skimming (actually) Working", "updated_at": "1723546522", "user": "AdrianoDee"}

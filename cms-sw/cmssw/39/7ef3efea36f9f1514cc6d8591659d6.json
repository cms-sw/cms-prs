These are run with:\r\n   - `Run3` era (N.B. may be changed with https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/43761); \r\n   - `HLT:@relval2024` (currently pointing at GRun);\r\n   - `Run2024C = {380049: [[33,903]]}` run and lumis for Era C (based on the Golden json [here](https://cms-service-dqmdc.web.cern.ch/CAF/certification/Collisions24/Cert_Collisions2024_eraC_Golden.json));\r\n   - `Run2024D = {380310: [[1, 1131]]}` run and lumis for Era D (based on internal communications with @cms-sw/dqm-l2).\r\n\r\n2. a fix to the fact that  the `InputInfo` class, while accepting as input a variable `events` does not really use it to skim the result of the das query. It's only really used in a [log](https://github.com/AdrianoDee/cmssw/blob/1d62219e28a38c574b9cc9af52ec07d34ab5303e/Configuration/PyReleaseValidation/python/MatrixReader.py#L389). I find it ambiguous and a bit confusing. In practice it also means that for 2023 and 2022 RelVals we have been running on O(few millions) events per pre-release (see e.g. [CMSSW_14_1_0_pre3__Data_Run3_2023_Data-RunEGamma2023D](https://cms-pdmv-prod.web.cern.ch/relval/relvals?prepid=CMSSW_14_1_0_pre3__Data_Run3_2023_Data-RunEGamma2023D-00001&shown=1082367&page=0&limit=50)). While this is nice in terms of being able to do that (kudos on computing!) it usually slows down a lot the RelVal production. So in order to be able to skim them I'm introducing a script `das-up-to-nevents.py` that takes in input a list of files and return the sublist that sums up to the requested `--events`. In this way this can easily be chained with `das-selected-lumis.py`. For the moment I'm applying this only to 2024 wfs for which the `*.XXX1` wfs have this skim. In a shortly following PR I would apply this also to 2023 and 2022 wfs in order to normalize the RelVal production.\r\n\r\nAll the needed input RAW samples have been copied via Rucio at `T2_CH_CERN`.\r\n \r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRunning (e.g.) `runTheMatrix.py -l 143.0010,143.0011,143.0020,143.0021`", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1716809918", "deletions": 10, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "tests-started", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 45055, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "2024 Data RelVals and `InputInfo` Events Skimming (actually) Working", "updated_at": "1716878197", "user": "AdrianoDee"}

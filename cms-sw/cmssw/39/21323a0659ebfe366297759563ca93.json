Add D14 scenario as D12 w/ T5 tracker (extra disk), corresponding workflows\r\n2. Remove D7 from short matrix (uses C1, nobody really cares anymore), add D12\r\n3. Default OOT window for Phase2 is now -3,+3 for 140 and 200 PU. Alternate versions with the old -12,+3 and a new special option -6,+6 are added (only for 25ns).\r\n4. Reduce code duplication in `relval_2023` (used to port upgrade workflows to regular matrix); here I fixed a bug where the `trackingOnly` workflows in the upgrade matrix didn't have the right beamspot for 14 TeV\r\n5. Remove separate `_Timing` workflow keys (associated WF numbers added to skip list so other numbers won't change); instead add timing workflow variations as `2XXXX.2`, only for ttbar (just Era changes), and run in IBs\r\n\r\nattn: @boudoul @makortel @calabria @slava77 @mdhildreth ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 13, "closed_at": "1493265991", "comments": 50, "commits": 10, "created_at": "1492445181", "deletions": 98, "labels": ["comparison-available", "geometry-pending", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "e7406cd01066fe1aa9b62e40e5802084542ac908", "merged_at": "1493265991", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_1_X", "number": 18373, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "Phase2 workflow updates (add D14, D12 in short matrix, new OOT PU settings, Timing)", "updated_at": "1493622637", "user": "kpedro88"}

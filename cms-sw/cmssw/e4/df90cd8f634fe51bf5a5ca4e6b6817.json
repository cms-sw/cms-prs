Propagation to the hit starts from the state at the previous hit (by re-calling the `mkfndr->inputTracksAndHitIdx(...)` ).\r\n\r\nThis also updates the material effects, as developed by @slava77.\r\n\r\nBoth changes are currently disabled by default via `mkfit::Config` switches, making this a technical PR to support further development, especially for layer-processing optimizations & improvements and for supporting Phase2 tilted geometry.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nMTV plots in preparation, there should be no significant changes.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 12, "comments": 6, "commits": 19, "created_at": "1698572657", "deletions": 124, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "tracking"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_3_X", "number": 43146, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[mkFit] Propagate to plane -- technical changes to support further development", "updated_at": "1698606741", "user": "osschar"}

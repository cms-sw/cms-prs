The `isMTCC` algorithm still uses distrips, which has not been used at all since the 2007 version of the firmware was installed. In the 2007 version of the algorithm the distrips are not used to trigger the chamber in the simulation.\r\n\r\nI also removed two outdated LCT quality definitions in the `CSCMotherboard` class.\r\n\r\nI compared the output from the trigger primitive reader on 10,000 events in 2018D data before and after the pull request. I see no differences. \r\n\r\nFYI @tahuang1991 @ptcox @lpernie ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 21, "closed_at": "1533998231", "comments": 17, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1533773417", "deletions": 1276, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "cf72c879b19b36aafbb2782159f0bf07438ad29c", "merged_at": "1533998231", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_3_X", "number": 24254, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Remove outdated options in the CSC local trigger.

The `isMTCC` algorithm still uses distrips. Distrips have not been used since the 2007 version of the firmware was installed. In addition, distrips are not used to trigger the chambers in the 2007 version of the simulation. So the options can be safely removed.\r\n\r\nI also removed two outdated LCT quality definitions in the `CSCMotherboard` class.\r\n\r\nI compared the output of the trigger primitive reader on 10,000 events in 2018D data before and after the pull request. I see no differences. \r\n\r\nFYI @tahuang1991 @ptcox @lpernie ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 21, "closed_at": "1533998231", "comments": 17, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1533773417", "deletions": 1276, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "cf72c879b19b36aafbb2782159f0bf07438ad29c", "merged_at": "1533998231", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_3_X", "number": 24254, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Remove outdated options in the CSC local trigger.

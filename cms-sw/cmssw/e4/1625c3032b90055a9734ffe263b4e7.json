Simplify helper structs of `TrajSeedMatcher`\r\n2. Be more consistent in treating electrons and positrons symmetrically in the offline `ElectronSeedProucer`, as already started with https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/29304\r\n3. Again fix the hit skipping logic in `TrajSeedMatcher`. One fix was already done in the previous PR, but I noticed there was still a problem that would end the matching loop prematurely if hits were skipped. After this PR, the logic for hit skipping should be correct (at least in the matching loop).\r\n4. Some minor simplifications in the `TrajSeedMatcher`\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCMSSW compiles and local matrix tests pass.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nNo backport intended.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 8, "closed_at": "1590561730", "comments": 16, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1589302891", "deletions": 226, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "c1ac2ff52ae8f91bc2379a8e6160d100f40f126d", "merged_at": "1590561730", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 29815, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Continue work on electron seeding convergence", "updated_at": "1590561730", "user": "guitargeek"}

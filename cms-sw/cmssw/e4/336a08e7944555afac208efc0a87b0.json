Fot the updated B-tags from the old CSV ones to deepCSV the working points were updated accordingly based on the 2018 campaign as described on the BTV internal wiki. \r\n- Other changes made include: \r\n\r\n1. the update from `<reco::PFCandidate>` objects which are obsolete to  f.e. `<reco::Muon>`, `<reco::GsfElectron>` per the relevant objects found in the input files used. \r\n2.  The update of selection cuts structure to remove unnecessary references and dependencies e.g. `mediumMuonCut = looseMuonCut + \" muonRef.innerTrack.validFraction > 0.8\"` becomes `mediumMuonCut = looseMuonCut + \" innerTrack.validFraction > 0.8\"`.\r\n3. Some unnecessary checks in loops like: \r\n```\r\n if (muonit->muonRef().isNull())\r\n        continue;\r\n      reco::MuonRef muon = muonit->muonRef();\r\n```\r\nin [TopSingleLeptonDQM.cc](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/48600daa76c0dd3925eb34d216bc756ed556016d/DQM/Physics/src/TopSingleLeptonDQM.cc#L465) were removed completely.\r\n4. Histograms for jets 3 and 4 were added to [SingleTopTChannelLeptonDQM.cc](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/DQM/Physics/src/SingleTopTChannelLeptonDQM.cc) for completion purposes and to align it with the [TopSingleLeptonDQM.cc](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/DQM/Physics/src/TopSingleLeptonDQM.cc) analysis.\r\n5.  Certain comments that were not useful or obsolete were removed to make the code more conscise. \r\n\r\n- There is a minor dependence on a previous PR number #44299 which dealt with the same issues for the miniAOD directories in the TOP DQM where the main focus was tag updating as in here.\r\n- [BTV internal wiki 2018 campaign](https://btv-wiki.docs.cern.ch/ScaleFactors/UL2018/)\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with a description of the feature proposed or problem addressed, specifying:\r\n  - what changes are expected in the output if any, \r\n  - what other PRs or externals it depends upon if any,\r\n  - link to any additional material useful to provide a documentation for this PR (slides, JIRA tickets, related pull requestes, hypernews, TWiki or Indico pages)  -->\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTo verify the results of the aforementioned actions the file `DQM/Physics/test/topDQM_production_cfg.py` was executed with `cmsRun` to produce a .root file that was then used as input for the `DQM/Physics/test/topDQM_harvesting_cfg.py` to produce a tree with the relevant histograms needed that were browsed using the TBrowser root feature.

This would add 13 taggers and 4 mass regression correctors to Scouting NanoAOD.\r\n\r\nScouting Global Particle Transformer (Glo-ParT) is an inclusive tagging model for AK8 scouting PFjets. It functions as both a global tagger and a mass regression model for AK8 scouting PFjets and can also be utilized as a pre-trained model. Further details can be found in the slides.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe PR passed the tests listed at https://cms-sw.github.io/PRWorkflow.html\r\n\r\n#### Backport:\r\n\r\nBackport of PR https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/47801", "branch": "CMSSW_15_0_X", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 19, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1744466213", "deletions": 10, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "requires-external", "backport-ok", "xpog-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_0_X", "number": 47853, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[15_0_X] Backport of #47801 (Add the Scouting Glo-ParT inference facility)", "updated_at": "1745217422", "user": "yiyangzha"}

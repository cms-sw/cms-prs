There are 2 summary plots for each of the ALCT showers, CLCT showers, LCT combined showers, and EMTF showers. The plot setting follows the CSC TP plots in [PR#36226](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/36226).\r\n\r\nAt the moment shower objects are not implemented in CSC or EMTF firmwares. Emulation is used in the place of data in this PR and the setting will be updated to data once showers are available.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis PR is tested with 10k events in a Higgs to LLP to 4b sample, plot examples are available at [link](https://xzuo.web.cern.ch/ShowerDQM/data_vs_emul/) \r\n\r\nThe PR passed local unit tests and matrix tests. The standard code format is applied.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nN/A.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 18, "closed_at": "1639038224", "comments": 9, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1638892561", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "746c33ad3c1610ce83f7e4c447fade8cddd3afe1", "merged_at": "1639038224", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 36396, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add data-vs-emulator plots for L1T shower DQM", "updated_at": "1639038224", "user": "zuoxunwu"}

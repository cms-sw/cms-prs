This means that\r\nthings like std::string are not binary compatible between old \"GCC 4\"\r\nABI and new one (C++11, default since GCC 5). The changes to GNU C++\r\nStandard Library were needed to meet C++ Standard Library requirements\r\nfor C++11. Note that GNU libstdc++ is dual-ABI.\r\n\r\nOracle Instant Client is not compiled with latest GCC and C++11 ABI. One\r\ncould avoid issues by using methods which do not use, e.g., std::string,\r\nor use C-level API.\r\n\r\nThis lacks proper testings. All the tests within CMSSW are disabled for\r\nunknown reason. Also these are probably not used within IB RelVals.\r\n\r\nThis does compile with GCC 6.3.0 + C++11 ABI.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: David Abdurachmanov <David.Abdurachmanov@cern.ch>", "branch": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1485186565", "comments": 42, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1484141253", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["comparison-available", "db-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "5979d3b5c0c272131048203cb68c154ae73c8034", "merged_at": "1485186565", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "number": 17147, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Avoid Oracle OCCI APIs which work with std::string in C++11 ABI mode", "updated_at": "1512572251", "user": "davidlt"}

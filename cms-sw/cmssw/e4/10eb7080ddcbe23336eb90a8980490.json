The following step can then read this output and the original RAW file.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe 139.00x RelVals appear to be the only ones that have an HLT only step. I changed their step 2 to only use the HLTONLY content and told step3 to use `--secondfilein` to read the RAW file as well as step2.root. The job ran fine.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 14, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1649878497", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["operations-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 37560, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Create HLTONLY*EventContent", "updated_at": "1650839892", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

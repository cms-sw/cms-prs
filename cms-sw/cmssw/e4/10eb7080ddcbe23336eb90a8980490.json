The following step can then read this output and the original RAW file.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe 139.00x RelVals appear to be the only ones that have an HLT only step. I changed their step 2 to only use the HLTONLY content and told step3 to use `--secondfilein` to read the RAW file as well as step2.root. The job ran fine.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1650875487", "comments": 21, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1649878497", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["hlt-approved", "operations-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "30fd95b67591bd61df5ed70b510776e982eb8e01", "merged_at": "1650875487", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 37560, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Create HLTONLY*EventContent", "updated_at": "1650875487", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

This should alleviate the output size and the burden on disk and operation teams.\r\nThis is proposed in this PR. As a new  `eventSetupPathsKey`  (= `TkAlJetHTHLT`) is introduced here a new set of `AlCaRecoTriggerBitsRcd` tags:\r\n   * `AlCaRecoHLTpaths_2017_offline_v6` which is a superset of the production tag `AlCaRecoHLTpaths_2017_offline_v4`, but will all IOVs substituted by new payloads adding the `TkAlJetHT` key (used in `auto:run2_data*`)\r\n   * `AlCaRecoHLTpaths_2021_offline_v2`  which is a superset of the production tag `AlCaRecoHLTpaths_2021_offline_v1`, but will all IOVs substituted by new payloads adding the `TkAlJetHT` key (used in `auto:run3_data*`)\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRun successfully the Tier-0 testing workflow:\r\n```console\r\nrunTheMatrix.py -l 1000.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nverbatim backport of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/38254\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "changed_files": 8, "comments": 18, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1654526214", "deletions": 7, "labels": ["operations-pending", "alca-approved", "dqm-approved", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "backport-ok"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 38261, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[12.4.X] Introduce `TkAlJetHT`", "updated_at": "1654709785", "user": "mmusich"}

In addition, required core lepton have to have at least 50% of total momentum.\n- Neutrinos - take status=1 neutrinos\n- Jets - anti-kT 0.5 jets including neutrinos, excluding particles used in Lepton clustering. Rescaled (ghost) B hadrons are also added during jet clustering to be used gen. level b tagging\n- W boson - do the combinations and pick the best pairs which is near to PDG value\n- top quark - similar to W bosons\n\nDefault cfg.py is configured to run on miniAOD, it can be run on usual genParticles.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1426171696", "comments": 13, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1423653994", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "05c4fb6b864a14b5098954c062ee55b2e7a75294", "merged_at": "1426171696", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 7670, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Including PsuedoTop in TQAF", "updated_at": "1427100234", "user": "jhgoh"}

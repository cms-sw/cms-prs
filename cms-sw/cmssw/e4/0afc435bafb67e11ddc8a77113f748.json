These particles cannot be saved because the range for eta in the packing is restricted to [-6,6]. \nOn the other hand while eta of a GenJet constituent can extend beyond 6, the \"rapidity\" (used in jet clustering) cannot extend beyond GenJetEta + JetDRparameter. Considering relevant jets up to eta 5, the constituents should never exceed 6 (even for AK8 GenJets we should get up to 5.8).\n\nThe PackedGenCandidates are then fixed by storing persistently the \"rapidity\" in range [-6,6] rather than the pseudorapidity.\nAn ioread function is provided to keep compatibility (i.e. be able to read 72X MINIAOD)\n\nSpeed at read-time should be checked to see if this introduces any regression.\n\n@gpetruc \n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1423824127", "comments": 11, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1423165385", "deletions": 11, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 7584, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Use rapidity instead of pseudo-rapidity in the packing of PackedGenParticles", "updated_at": "1423824127", "user": "arizzi"}

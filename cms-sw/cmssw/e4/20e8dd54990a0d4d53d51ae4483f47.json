We update the material budget code since three new materials are added (`Polystyrene`,`HGC_EEConnector` and `HGC_HEConnector`, essentially scintillator, Air and Air at the moment) while Cables are renamed to `HGC_Cables`. \r\n2. We update the dEdx weights script since the longitudinal structure of the detector is changed with 3 layers removed apart from the addition/renaming of the materials mentioned above. \r\n3. We extend the basic scripts responsible for the webpage creation for the same reasons. \r\n4. Given the opportunity we correct my mistake on naming the `html.py` with the same name as a basic module, a bad practice which I learned the hard way. So, we rename the `html.py` script to `hgcalHtml.py`. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nAll the above have been tested/used on the latest `12_2_0_pre3_Phase2_D88` RelVal campaign for the creation of the validation report. \r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nThis is not a backport.\r\n\r\n@rovere @felicepantaleo @pfs @lecriste @ebrondol ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 10, "closed_at": "1641929526", "comments": 29, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1641551518", "deletions": 4326, "labels": ["dqm-approved", "geometry-approved", "simulation-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "d20907915bf74a1b0aac3731148e9ea4aa017aa3", "merged_at": "1641929526", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 36645, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "[HGCAL] Updates due to V16 geometry", "updated_at": "1641929527", "user": "apsallid"}

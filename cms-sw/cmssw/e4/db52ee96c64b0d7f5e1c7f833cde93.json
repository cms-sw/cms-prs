I forgot to also update the \"noPU\" workflows that just run pp collisions, but with the heavy-ion era.  Since those wfs use the same beamspot tag, they were running with an inconsistent vertex smearing and reco beamspot.   This PR fixes that.  I also did a bit of cleanup. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI only tested that `runTheMatrix.py -n -e` doesn't crash. \r\nWe should trigger 159.02, 159.3 and 310\r\n\r\nI don't think we need a backport.\r\n\r\n@prebello \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1677051995", "comments": 15, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1675193730", "deletions": 19, "labels": ["fully-signed", "tests-approved", "pdmv-approved", "orp-approved", "upgrade-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "c56dd8abcf2fea3b2ad8037028d8bdb4b58587a5", "merged_at": "1677051995", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_13_1_X", "number": 40653, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 4, "state": "closed", "title": "Use `--beamspot Nominal2022PbPbCollision` for all Run 3 heavy-ion workflows", "updated_at": "1677051996", "user": "mandrenguyen"}

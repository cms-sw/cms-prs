The goal of the PR is to bring the CPU legacy code in sync with the GPU code as a follow up to the discussions in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/35376 and https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/37359\r\n\r\nNo changes are expected in MC samples. In the data there could be some tiny differences in case some duplicate pixels appear.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles :)\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1649340058", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 37496, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Add duplicate pixels", "updated_at": "1649411664", "user": "ferencek"}

This leads to mismatches in the uGMT data-emulator DQM because we unpack these debug data, interpret them as dXY and unconstrained pT, and then proceed to run the emulator on these inputs. The emulator output therefore doesn't match the firmware output anymore as the firmware correctly ignores those data.\r\nWith this change we avoid unpacking those fields until the uGMT firmware version changes to indicate that we actually use them in the algorithm.\r\n\r\nattn: @panoskatsoulis as the BMTF output (un)packer slightly changes too.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRan `scram b runtests && runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos` successfully.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 10, "closed_at": "1630543301", "comments": 13, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1628181442", "deletions": 29, "labels": ["l1-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "3ceb844ac9581656babdde3a87d5b1584255b01e", "merged_at": "1630543301", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "number": 34801, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Correct RegionalMuon (un)packer when running on EMTF data", "updated_at": "1630543301", "user": "dinyar"}

Therefore at the moment the shower DQM cannot be used in data-taking and is not enabled in the online DQM sequence. It will be enabled once the EMTF shower unpacker is ready.\r\nIn this PR we do not expect any change in the output.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe DQM plots are tested with HTo2LongLivedTo4b samples and Neutrino gun samples. \r\nPassed the unit test and matrix test as there should be no change in the output.\r\nCode format changes are applied.\r\n\r\n@dildick may want to watch this.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "comments": 5, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1636972224", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_2_X", "number": 36128, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Add online DQM plots for Run 3 L1T shower trigger", "updated_at": "1636981543", "user": "zuoxunwu"}

Previously the 2016 beamspot simulation was never changed to avoid inconsistencies between 2016 MC that had already been generated and any newly generated MC. There is no such consistency requirement for the UL as it will involve the regeneration of all GEN-SIM and so we can use the correct beamspot simulation. See the news from the [12 December 2019 PPD meeting](https://indico.cern.ch/event/863633/#7-news) for details.\r\n\r\nThe global tag updates change the `BeamSpotObjectsRcd` tag to `BeamSpotObjects_Realistic25ns_13TeV2016Collisions_v1_mc` for 2016 MC scenarios. The vertex smearing used by 2016 workflows has also been updated for consistency.\r\n\r\nIt also updates the [MC tracker alignment scenario for the 2016 pre-VFP era](https://hypernews.cern.ch/HyperNews/CMS/get/calibrations/4254.html).\r\n\r\n**Global tag diffs**\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/110X_mcRun2_design_v3/110X_mcRun2_design_v4\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/110X_mcRun2_asymptotic_preVFP_v1/110X_mcRun2_asymptotic_preVFP_v3\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/110X_mcRun2_asymptotic_v5/110X_mcRun2_asymptotic_v6\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/110X_mcRun2cosmics_startup_deco_v4/110X_mcRun2cosmics_startup_deco_v5\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe beamspot parameters  are explicitly listed on slide 5 of the news from the [12 December 2019 PPD meeting](https://indico.cern.ch/event/863633/#7-news) together with fitted beamspot parameters from data and MC. In addition, a technical test was performed: `runTheMatrix.py -l 7.22,limited --ibeos`. Note that no RelVal workflows use either `auto:run2_design` or `auto:run2_mc_l1stage1` (though the addOn tests use `auto:run2_mc_l1stage1`) so a similar technical test cannot be performed for these GTs.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\n\r\nThis PR is not a backport but will be backported to 11_0_X and 10_6_X.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1578511517", "comments": 35, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1576267631", "deletions": 10, "labels": ["alca-approved", "analysis-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "pdmv-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "5c22fd41f20341869622fa17685d79269cf90a9d", "merged_at": "1578511517", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 28624, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Use correct beamspot for 2016 MC + update MC tracker alignment scenario for 2016 pre-VFP era", "updated_at": "1578511517", "user": "christopheralanwest"}

Examples of such samples were discussed in https://cms-talk.web.cern.ch/t/higgs-in-wz-amcatnlofxfx-samples/55138. \r\n\r\nThe nanoAOD production crashes in such samples as the `TauSpinnerTableProducer` produces a non-empty table for events with the HTT decay while empty one for events without it which leads to an inconsistent output across different events which then confuses the output module.\r\n\r\nThe fix consists of producing tables with default weights for events without HTT ensuring consistency, but for price of producing not needed numbers. To be noted that similar strategy is employed in case of HTXS tables. Overhead due to this should be limited as tables with constant values are efficiently compressed.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nValidated by processing samples with events containing the HTT decay, without the HTT decay and mixed with and without.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nNo backport expected.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1731415803", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved", "xpog-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_2_X", "number": 46679, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Protect TauSpinnerTable producer against crash with samples with HTT mixed with other processes", "updated_at": "1731426868", "user": "mbluj"}

This is now extended to also OMTF and EMTF muons. This will mostly have an effect on the DQM, removing uGMT data-emulator mismatches during cosmics data taking. (cc @pmandrik; this is the 12_4_X backport.)\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRan on RAW data locally and confirmed that the index bit mismatches went away.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nBackport of [#38532](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/38532) as I would like this included in the online DQM.

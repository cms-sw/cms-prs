The first was PR #47565. That PR removed support for SubProcess from the CMS configuration system and made it impossible to run a job with a SubProcess configured. It also removed all SubProcess tests.\r\n\r\nResolves https://github.com/cms-sw/framework-team/issues/1282\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRelies on existing tests. There is no new functionality. This is cleaning up code that served no purpose anymore.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 42, "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1742589170", "deletions": 2223, "labels": ["core-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 47659, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Remove SubProcess and references in EventProcessor related code", "updated_at": "1742589395", "user": "wddgit"}

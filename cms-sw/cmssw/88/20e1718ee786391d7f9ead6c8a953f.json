Namely the unpacker was allowing the process the proceed up to the max. number of sub-packets that may exist and relying on sub-packet identifiers to continue or stop. In cases where padding to 64b is needed the backend may spuriously generate a word which resembles the sub-packet identified making the unpacker crash.\r\nThis was solved in two ways\r\n* limit the unpacking to the max. number of sub-packets (capture blocks) expected for given FED : this PR\r\n* change the padding in the backend firmware to be a 0 instead of word copy : independent of this PR\r\n\r\nIn the PR we propose also a simple patch to the `EventFilter/Utilities/src/DAQSourceModelsDTH.cc` to cope with DTH-P2 from @ hqucms. @smorovic - up to you if you prefer this taken out of this PR\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nPR was validated using data collected at CERN and FNAL for the first pre-series cassettes.

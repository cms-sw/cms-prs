DQM module for the CSC trigger primitives. Since then, it has been superseded by dedicated modules in `DQM/CSCMonitorModule`. It was enabled in the DQM chain until 2014 at which point it was turned off as explained here: https://github.com/dmitrijus/cmssw/commit/069cc0a00b211ce1bcf8c37600237bfbf9eb0982. It also used to be enabled in test configurations in ` DQM/CSCMonitorModule`. Furthermore, `CSCTriggerPrimitivesDQM` is derived from `CSCTriggerPrimitivesReader` which has the same purpose, namely comparing unpacked ALCT/CLCT/LCT with re-emulated ALCT/CLCT/LCT. \r\n\r\nPart of this project is also to update the `CSCTriggerPrimitivesReader`. That will be done in a future PR.\r\n\r\n@tahuang1991 @lpernie ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 7, "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1533301911", "deletions": 1223, "labels": ["code-checks-pending", "comparison-pending", "dqm-pending", "l1-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_3_X", "number": 24196, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Remove obsolete CSC DQM module in L1Trigger/CSCTriggerPrimitives", "updated_at": "1533302013", "user": "dildick"}

The module `CSCTriggerPrimitivesDQM` in `L1Trigger/CSCTriggerPrimitives` used to function as a (maybe even the?) DQM module for the CSC trigger primitives. Since then, it has been superseded by dedicated modules in `DQM/CSCMonitorModule`. It was enabled in the DQM chain until 2014 at which point it was turned off as explained here: https://github.com/dmitrijus/cmssw/commit/069cc0a00b211ce1bcf8c37600237bfbf9eb0982. It also used to be enabled in test configurations in ` DQM/CSCMonitorModule`. Furthermore, `CSCTriggerPrimitivesDQM` is derived from `CSCTriggerPrimitivesReader` which has the same purpose, namely comparing unpacked ALCT/CLCT/LCT with re-emulated ALCT/CLCT/LCT. It is therefore deemed obsolete and can safely be removed.\r\n\r\nPart of this project is also to update the `CSCTriggerPrimitivesReader`. That will be done in a future PR.\r\n\r\n@tahuang1991 @lpernie ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": "1533620307", "comments": 13, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1533301911", "deletions": 1223, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "272f90e37130798f24d9d786f907ca05992dbaec", "merged_at": "1533620307", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_3_X", "number": 24196, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Remove obsolete CSC DQM module in L1Trigger/CSCTriggerPrimitives", "updated_at": "1544497510", "user": "dildick"}

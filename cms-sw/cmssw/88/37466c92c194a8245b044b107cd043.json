I wanted to do this for some time in the GsfElectronAlgo anyway, because in this way I can get rid of the manual caching with the `unsigned long long cacheID` member variables, trusting the framework to handle this efficiently on its own and bringing us a good step closer to an algo with no mutable member variables. The remaining class members were also reorganized a bit to further reduce the mutable state and make it clearer what is still mutable: the HcalHelper, the RegressionHelper and the EcalClusterFunctions.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCMSSW compiles and local matrix tests pass.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\n\r\nNo backport intended.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1574064946", "comments": 11, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1573601220", "deletions": 381, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "078e9a0ca8c9d370674fb7f6884c48b84b4b0a9c", "merged_at": "1574064946", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 28389, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 4, "state": "closed", "title": "Register consumes from the EventSetup in GsfElectronAlgo", "updated_at": "1574064946", "user": "guitargeek"}

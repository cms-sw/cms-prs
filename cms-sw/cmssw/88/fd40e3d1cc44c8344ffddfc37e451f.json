With this update, the two HF MinBias FG thresholds are retrieved from the conditions via the `HcalTPParameters` payload (using the previously unused`auxi1` field). A dedicated switch is also implemented to provide a fallback to the thresholds defined in the cff file. \r\n\r\n- For the time being, no changes are expected in the output, until the conditions are updated with non-zero values in the auxi1 field of HcalTPParameters. \r\n- This PR is self-contained and does not depend on other PRs or externals.\r\n- Additional documentation:  [Indico](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1580570/), [cmshcal#288]( https://gitlab.cern.ch/cmshcal/docs/-/issues/288)\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n- Code compiles successfully under CMSSW_16_0_X with `scram build code-checks` and `scram build code-format`.\r\n- Local tests with `runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos` completed without errors.\r\n- Tests were performed using `CaloOnlineTools/HcalOnlineDb/test/genLUT.sh`. Thresholds were correctly retrieved from conditions or from the cff when `auxi1` is empty or when the fallback switch is used. LUTs for HF are produced with the expected values in both cases.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

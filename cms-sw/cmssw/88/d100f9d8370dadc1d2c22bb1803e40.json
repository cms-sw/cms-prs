Now in the latest MWGR data used in workflow 138.1, there is no SCAL FED data any more, so we need to use the softFED data instead, but that has a different product name in offline.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes the input tag configurable and sets it correctly in offline.\r\n\r\nThanks @mmusich for spotting this!\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nWorks in 138.1, other WF will be seen in the PR tests. This should not affect online, if things went well.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1583916637", "comments": 18, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1583837436", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "17e6869c6ea494367cc3a95af59cef266f20f1b2", "merged_at": "1583916637", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 29161, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "DQM: Fix dcsRecord input tag in offline for DQMProvInfo", "updated_at": "1583916637", "user": "schneiml"}

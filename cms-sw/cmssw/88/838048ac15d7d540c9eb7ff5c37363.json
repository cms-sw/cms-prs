Instead of returning 16 parameters, DD4hep now returns 8 parameters. The CMS code had to be updated to read the new parameters correctly.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis new code was verified by running the magnetic field geometry builder, which uses truncated tubes. With this PR, the geometry builder builds and checks thousands of truncated tubes of various sizes with no errors.\r\n\r\nNo backport is needed.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1575363335", "comments": 23, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1574892380", "deletions": 52, "labels": ["bug-fix", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "542d7f89b1169aa4e863bacb823145fae6ab2713", "merged_at": "1575363335", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 28496, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "Update truncated tube shape parameters to match new version of DD4hep", "updated_at": "1575363335", "user": "cvuosalo"}

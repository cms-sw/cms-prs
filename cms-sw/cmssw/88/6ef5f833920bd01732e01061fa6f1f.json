(Ability is off by default).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n- Added a unit test for HFShowerLibrary to show with and without caching give same results. Test also shows that all three existing data files can be read without errors.\r\n- Ran demonstrator which produces pileup files by running the GEN+SIM step for the minimum bias within the mixing module. This generated around 80,000 min bias per job (800 minibias/event with 100 events) using 8 threads without issues.\r\n\r\nComparing timing with and without caching showed a 1-2% speed improvement when using caching.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 14, "closed_at": "1670833127", "comments": 7, "commits": 11, "created_at": "1670608359", "deletions": 397, "labels": ["simulation-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "ce1f7030e3acda4db7cb827a1159ca3d3460eed7", "merged_at": "1670833127", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "number": 40278, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 9, "state": "closed", "title": "Allow caching of HFShowerLibrary", "updated_at": "1670833127", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

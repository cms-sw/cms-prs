There should be no \"well-behaved\" channels in EB with a correction larger than 2.0\n2. the EE maximum laser correction must be increased, given the larger irradiation experienced in 2016. The previous threshold of 8 for the EE laser correction, large as it is, would likely create some false positives in the innermost eta rings of EE if applied to the most recent data.\n\nFor RECO, theEcalChannelStatus tag that masks the offending channel in EB for the entire 2016 dataset. In that case, the channel will be suppressed and no additional filter is needed.\n\nThis filter will be in the miniAOD and should be applied in analysis using the prompt-reco and in case re-reco doens't happen  in favour of a re-miniAOD\n\n@zdemirag @schoef \n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1472190376", "comments": 6, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1472141170", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "6b40e9eab916d8d51d18d0d96976e04164682165", "merged_at": "1472190376", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 15609, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Update the ecalLaserCorr filter for the 2016 ", "updated_at": "1472190376", "user": "mariadalfonso"}

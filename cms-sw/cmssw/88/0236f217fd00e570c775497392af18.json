It extends the set of tools used by the muon community to provide results for the Scope Document and bring them to CMSSW for inclusion in (dedicated) productions or RelVals.\r\n\r\nIt provides:\r\n\r\n1. A format to generate aging/masking conditions for the different subsystems\r\n1. Different EDProducers to generate \"degraded\" version of the muon system digis\r\n1. Cff snippets used in a customise function to plug \"degraded\" digis into offline RECO\r\n\r\nIt is aimed to be used for muon TDR studies, to mimic failures or aging (by means of removal of digis), and it is applied as customization as it is not meant for general inclusions in all production workflows.\r\n\r\nSome details on code and use cases are given in the \"Background, longevity and failure rate scenarios\" session of the last [Muon Upgrade Workshop](https://indico.cern.ch/event/614702/other-view?view=cms).\r\n\r\n@calabria @jshlee : please complete the descriptions with whatever relevant might be missing.\r\n\r\n[1] CSC : @aminnj, RPC : @bapavlov, GEM : @sunilUIET, DT : @battibass\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_9_1_X", "changed_files": 33, "closed_at": "1491317815", "comments": 1, "commits": 12, "created_at": "1491317801", "deletions": 0, "labels": [], "number": 18197, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Combined tools for muon system aging/masking for upgrade studies", "updated_at": "1491317816", "user": "battibass"}

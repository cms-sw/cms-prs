In the logs there were lines \"Found ... lumisections during the fill ...\" with lumisections number higher than 100 confirming the fix.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1662547696", "comments": 21, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1661414715", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["fully-signed", "tests-approved", "db-approved", "bug-fix", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved", "ctpps"], "merge_commit_sha": "2c04dc2db38c7ec73f071f2ac1dd03d61e207b52", "merged_at": "1662547696", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_6_X", "number": 39188, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "PPS fixed LHCInfo PopCon 100 lumisections query limit", "updated_at": "1664013831", "user": "JanChyczynski"}

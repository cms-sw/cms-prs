In the logs there were lines \"Found ... lumisections during the fill ...\" with lumisections number higher than 100 confirming the fix.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1661414715", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["db-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 39188, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "fixed LHCInfo PopCon 100 lumisections query limit", "updated_at": "1661415259", "user": "JanChyczynski"}

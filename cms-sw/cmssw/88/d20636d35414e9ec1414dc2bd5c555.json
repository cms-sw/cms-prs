This works if era `Run2_2016`, or any other era that satisfies `eras.stage2L1Trigger.isChosen()`.\n\nChecked on `CMSSW_8_1_X_2016-04-13-1100` for matrix workflow 1324.0, verifying by hand in that in those events the L1 muons and jets in the MiniAOD file are in agreement with the corresponding offline objects. Will do a sanity check on data on run 269610 too.\n\nI did _not_ remove the old L1 objects from the event content, as I've seen that in the raw2digi sequence the reco is configured to unpack both the old and the new L1.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1461302282", "comments": 13, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1460551321", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-available", "l1-approved", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "7e4bacbfb27eded25f708940db50b358a853459a", "merged_at": "1461302282", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 14051, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 7, "state": "closed", "title": "Save L1 stage2 info in offline data tiers (81X)", "updated_at": "1464759708", "user": "gpetruc"}

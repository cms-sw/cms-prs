The new frozen menu will simply stay in the release, and can be used for possible MC productions that want to compare with the 50ns data.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 53, "closed_at": "1438405103", "comments": 31, "commits": 67, "created_at": "1438077258", "deletions": 7521, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "hlt-approved", "l1-approved", "orp-pending", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "e4af35953fe51c6a42ba3bec4f4fbb1a2738b5aa", "merged_at": "1438405104", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 10413, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Legacy 50ns frozen HLT menu in the release 74X", "updated_at": "1438407695", "user": "perrotta"}

There are a loads of plots on #9106 that show the benefit at 200 pileup.\n#9106 applies shrink_to_fit on the collection afterwards as well, which might or might not be merged since it increases the peak memory.  Using an accurate `reserve` however gives a clear benefit so I'll add this separately first.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1432027070", "comments": 5, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1431955514", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "core-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-started"], "merge_commit_sha": "90cd72c5f1de176db93cb2dd42a33a1dc8b408f3", "merged_at": "1432027070", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "number": 9135, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Backport RunningAverage and use for PFRecHitProducer reserve", "updated_at": "1432036559", "user": "mark-grimes"}

When `AVX512F AVX512_VNNI` instructions are present, the TF executor complains.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRun the HLT over all the error stream files from run-381543 and run-381544 following https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/45136#issuecomment-2150786504.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

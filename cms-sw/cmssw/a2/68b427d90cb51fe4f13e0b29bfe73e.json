This would allow the `dqmoffline` to run on GEN-SIM-RAW in Run-3 scenarios with GEMs included. Previously, `valEmtfStage2Digis` crashed because it could not find `simMuonGEMPadDigiClusters`. That is expected. A solution is provided where the GEM trigger primitive producers are run on unpacked GEM digis in GEN-SIM-RAW. Those GEM TP producers have prefixes ```valMuon```. `valMuonGEMPadDigiClusters` may be replaced with `emtfStage2Digis` once the EMTF unpacker has been updated for GEM TPs in data and the collection is available in the event.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles.

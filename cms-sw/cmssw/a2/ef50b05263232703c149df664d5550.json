The code of CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC will no doubt change underneath while this is in the queue, but at lease there's a record of what needs to be changed if I fall under a bus.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "changed_files": 21, "closed_at": "1414236780", "comments": 3, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1405951265", "deletions": 661, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "dqm-pending", "new-package-pending", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "Next CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "number": 4725, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Revert the DetId renumbering fix (when SLHC11/12 files no longer need to be read)", "updated_at": "1438587447", "user": "mark-grimes"}

Add input jet variables needed for the quark vs gluon likelihood (QGL) in the JME Custom-NanoAODs. The variables are useful QGL developers when they need to train the likelihood for future new releases. The input variables are already calculated together with the QGL discriminant in the main NanoAOD production. They are not saved in the main NanoAODs by default. Previous (closed) PR for this is #29239.\r\n\r\n2. Remove deprecated \"jerc\" variables and add new ones in line with the latest jets_cff.py. This fix is for issue #29245.\r\n\r\n**if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:**\r\n\r\nOriginal PR is #29257 ", "branch": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1597405393", "comments": 27, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1585073607", "deletions": 12, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "backport-ok", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "requires-external", "tests-started", "xpog-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 29290, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Backport of #29257 (Add QGL input variables and update jerc variables in JME Custom-NanoAODs) to 10_6_X", "updated_at": "1597405394", "user": "nurfikri89"}

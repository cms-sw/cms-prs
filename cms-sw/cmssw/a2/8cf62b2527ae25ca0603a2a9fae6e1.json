So we made an update to make it be able to run GEM packing/unpacking steps for phase-2 scenario.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n* The PR has tested with the `runTheMatrix.py -l 20834.911`, which is mentioned in the issue.\r\n* We are expecting some differences from the plots that is using DAQ status, which is the missing information from previous version.\r\n\r\n@jshlee @watson-ij @quark2 ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1671528818", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "operations-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "number": 40368, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[GEM] enable GEM packer/unpacker for phase 2 scenario", "updated_at": "1671600845", "user": "yeckang"}

So we made an update to make it be able to run GEM packing/unpacking steps for phase-2 scenario.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n* The PR has tested with the `runTheMatrix.py -l 20834.911`, which is mentioned in the issue.\r\n* We are expecting some differences from the plots that is using DAQ status, which is the missing information from previous version.\r\n\r\n@jshlee @watson-ij @quark2 ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1673416172", "comments": 18, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1671528818", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["operations-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "upgrade-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "ce89416dfad630a15d5d5d0cc2666c23a8e933f4", "merged_at": "1673416172", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "number": 40368, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "[GEM] enable GEM packer/unpacker for phase 2 scenario", "updated_at": "1673416173", "user": "yeckang"}

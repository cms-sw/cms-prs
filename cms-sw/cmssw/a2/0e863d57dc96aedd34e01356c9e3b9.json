As stated in its comment, the field `ndof` is sometimes used with vertex indices (and hence not used fully). This could be reviewed separately.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nAll unit tests from affected modules pass.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 20, "comments": 14, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1707836856", "deletions": 108, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "dqm-pending", "hlt-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "heterogeneous-pending", "tracking", "trk"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 43952, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "open", "title": "Z vertex multi layout", "updated_at": "1708057483", "user": "ericcano"}

As stated in its comment, the field `ndof` is sometimes used with vertex indices (and hence not used fully). This could be reviewed separately.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nAll unit tests from affected modules pass.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 22, "comments": 27, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1707836856", "deletions": 136, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "dqm-pending", "hlt-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending", "heterogeneous-pending", "tracking", "trk"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 43952, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "open", "title": "Z vertex multi layout", "updated_at": "1710241715", "user": "ericcano"}

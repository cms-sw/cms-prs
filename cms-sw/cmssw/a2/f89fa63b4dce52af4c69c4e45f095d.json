This PR contains only the proposed changes to the template CPE algorithm that are simpler, and beneficial for long clusters in heavily irradiated pixel sensors (right-most columns in [slides 23 onwards](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1554785/contributions/6550922/attachments/3081344/5455226/20250605_TOO-PixelCalibAndLocalReco.pdf)). The proposed changes to the algorithm are gated behind a process modifier.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nPR passes the basic battery of tests. In the cms-bot wf tests, we expect many small differences also osberved in the main PR. They are understood to come from uninitialized variables (that have been in CMSSW for some time) in the class touched by this PR, causing some numerical instabilities. The uninitialized variables will be fixed in a separate PR.", "branch": "CMSSW_15_0_X", "changed_files": 13, "closed_at": "1751269917", "comments": 17, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1750796282", "deletions": 21, "labels": ["operations-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "pdmv-approved", "db-approved", "orp-approved", "upgrade-approved", "backport-ok", "trk"], "merge_commit_sha": "f2495d35a5331b82b3a717dedbeaa63abbebabeb", "merged_at": "1751269916", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_15_0_X", "number": 48399, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "[15.0.X] Adapt template pixel cpe algo to better handle shortened or broken clusters", "updated_at": "1751269918", "user": "mroguljic"}

This PR copies those tests and adapts them to `RNTupleTemp*` IO components.\r\n\r\nTo share the same `SecondaryProducer` test module this PR moves it to `FWCore/TestModules` (and also merges the code from the header to the source file).\r\n\r\nThe last commit is cherry-picked from https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/49674 .\r\n\r\nResolves https://github.com/cms-sw/framework-team/issues/1730\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe added unit test runs", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 15, "closed_at": "1767076589", "comments": 10, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1766435013", "deletions": 69, "labels": ["core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "161f87df7a9b83b583468969bf352f6a852d6db3", "merged_at": "1767076589", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_16_1_X", "number": 49701, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Copy IOPool/SecondaryInput tests for RNTupleTemp IO", "updated_at": "1767076590", "user": "makortel"}

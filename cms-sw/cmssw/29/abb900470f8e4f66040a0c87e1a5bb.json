This was caused by PR #24920 , the dummy run number parameter of all GEN workflows was affected by the change introduced in [DQMSaverAtJobEnd_cff.py](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/24920/files#diff-de4766ca44b88f9363530b795048ba09) because all GEN Relval workflows were using '--harvesting AtJobEnd' option. Since there is no point of using '--harvesting AtJobEnd' option (there is only single harvesting job like any other Relval workflows), simply removing this option can fix the issue.\r\n\r\nFix the issue #25272 .

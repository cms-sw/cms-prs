One problem faced in the HIN UPC low pT pixel track triggers used in the PbPb 2023 data tacking, is that the candidates were not stored in the event since the path was relying on a standard filter (CandViewCountFilter) instead of a filter derived from HLTFilter class, which has made the study of the track efficiency challenging. To avoid this in the 2024 data tacking, the HLTPixelTrackFilter is updated to derive from the HLTFilter class and have the option to store the candidates, so it could be used in the HIN UPC triggers.\r\n\r\n@vince502 @mandrenguyen \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested locally by re-emulating the HLT menu and replacing the hltSinglePixelTrackLowPtForUPC module in the HLT_HIon_cff.py menu using the HLTPixelTrackFilter.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

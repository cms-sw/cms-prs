Therefore, this PR converted all the runs to a list to solve this error.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe PR has been validated by copying mergeJSON.py to a local area at lxplus and point to the local LumiList.py, with this PR, two JSONs could be merged without errors. Additionally, we also use this version of LumiList.py to launch cron jobs of DCS-only JSON files at lxplus in the central DQM-DC team. The cron jobs patch the new runs with good siStrip/pixel DCS status every day on top of the previous runs (using mergeJSON.py). These cron jobs have been launched 7 days ago and produced results without error.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 14, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1709032263", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["core-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 44201, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 5, "state": "open", "title": "Fix of LumiList.py so to allow the merge of JSON files", "updated_at": "1709228843", "user": "syuvivida"}

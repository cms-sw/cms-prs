With this change it drops to 4 seconds. That is about as fast as can be gotten with this change since 1/2 the time in #37934 is still being taken to construct the DDDetector.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "comments": 8, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1652380819", "deletions": 32, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "core-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-rejected", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 37936, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[RFC] Optimize MagGeoBuilder with TBB", "updated_at": "1652464449", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

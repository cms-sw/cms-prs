The test code that I added in #40813 turned out to have a flaw, because of which the problem was not caught earlier.\r\n\r\nRequiring the concrete ESProducer classes to explicitly call the base `ESProducer` class' constructor with the `ParameterSet` argument is a (minor) breaking change, but this was (by far) easiest way to fix the problem.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe unit tests succeeds on machines with and without a GPU.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

The changes are not significant since the architecture and data preprocessing has not changed much structurally compared to previous version. The changes include:\r\n* unification of the interface for scaling (aka standardization) of inputs across subversions and reading of scaling constants from a separate namespace,\r\n* functionality to drop specific global variables from a general list (TauBlockInputs),\r\n* adaptation of `runTauIdMVA.py` tool,\r\n* new `deepTauId2018v2p5` producer added to the miniAOD workflow and its products (raw tauIDs) stored in the `slimmedTaus` collection.\r\n\r\nFull list of adaptations needed for the v2p5 can be found here: https://github.com/cms-tau-pog/TauMLTools/issues/99.\r\n\r\nIn addition this PR consists of changes to DFIsolation producer (1st version of tauID based on DNN) which adapts the producer to changes in base class (previously overlooked).\r\n\r\n**Note:** this PR requires new training files being added to cms-data by https://github.com/cms-data/RecoTauTag-TrainingFiles/pull/8.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nStandard tests, i.e. `runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos`, passed successfully.\r\n\r\nBackward-compatibility checks: updated CMSSW code fully reproduces predictions of previous version (v2p1) of deepTauId.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1652797290", "comments": 50, "commits": 32, "created_at": "1652182696", "deletions": 533, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-rejected", "orp-approved", "requires-external", "code-checks-approved", "xpog-approved", "tau"], "merge_commit_sha": "0cd6c4f6a6ac8034ffbaff4eb6e2725d820c216e", "merged_at": "1652797289", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 37892, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 6, "state": "closed", "title": "Changes to enable new DeepTauId trainig", "updated_at": "1652797290", "user": "mbluj"}

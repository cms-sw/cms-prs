Backward compatibility is sustained.\r\n\r\nDuring tests of this PR we discovered as well that on of the parameters in the PPS DQM module was not marked as untracked.\r\nThis was probably a leftover from a  migration campaign done in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/38907\r\nAppropriate change comes as well with this PR.\r\n\r\nSee as well related https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/40763\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis PR was validated with relvals 136.793, 1043 and 1044 (which run PPS reconstruction).\r\nThe reconstruction of Run 2 and 2022 data seems not affected.\r\nNew XML is parsed properly, I ran cmsRun CalibPPS/ESProducers/test/test_totemDAQMappingESSourceXML_cfg.py to parse XML and print its content on the console.\r\nWe ran the tests of unpacker on dataset(run 364968) taken after hardware intervention. The raw2digi step produced expected results.\r\nWe do not have proper 2023 data taken with new cabling, so full-scale reconstruction tests are not possible yet.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1680012990", "comments": 15, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1679771947", "deletions": 13, "labels": ["alca-approved", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "bug-fix", "orp-approved", "urgent", "code-checks-approved", "ctpps"], "merge_commit_sha": "bdb7a00868e0a79044a67e0adb288ea34497dfe1", "merged_at": "1680012989", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_13_1_X", "number": 41187, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "PPS diamond mapping fix for 2023 run", "updated_at": "1680012990", "user": "grzanka"}

This PR fixes those problems. This PR is needed now by other developers who are working on geometry payload creation.\r\n\r\nThere are several design issues with these scripts that make them very brittle. In particular, they copy and edit scripts from several locations. I think these scripts need a major re-design to address such issues, but that is a major task that will have to be done in a later PR.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThese scripts are run by experts to create and check geometry DB payloads. They are not used in workflows. These changes were tested during the creation of new payloads.\r\n\r\nNo backport is needed.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1607539198", "comments": 19, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1606854732", "deletions": 34, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "db-approved", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "38fb609529497f62f38609c94aace7c29d574fb9", "merged_at": "1607539198", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 32361, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 8, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix small bugs in geometry DB payload scripts", "updated_at": "1607539198", "user": "cvuosalo"}

The patch provided in this PR will bypass that problem for photons, and photon's isolation sum will return a meaningful value. \r\n\r\nIn recent data (`2022C`, `EGamma` dataset) in Run `355872`, Event `546279379`, LumiSection `508`, \r\nwithout this PR: photon's `chargedHadronIso=-nan`\r\nwith this PR: photon's `chargedHadronIso=0.683148`\r\nThis is checked with these files:\r\nminiAOD: `/store/data/Run2022C/EGamma/MINIAOD/PromptReco-v1/000/355/872/00000/035b7e72-7f0d-42c8-98c7-d0a5100211fe.root`\r\nRAW: `/store/data/Run2022C/EGamma/RAW/v1/000/355/872/00000/3b478527-d206-4b8e-8004-08e9aff7758b.root`\r\nand, `eventsToProcess = cms.untracked.VEventRange('355872:546279379-355872:546279379')`\r\n\r\nIt was checked that similar `nan` issues in MC, discussed in the github issue (https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/39110), are also fixed with this patch, as expected.\r\n\r\nNote: we have not found any instance of electron's PFChargedHadIso being nan. Until now, the issue happened only for photons.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n`runTheMatrix.py -l 11834.0`\r\n\r\nThis PR is not a backport.\r\nSince the issue seem to be happening also in prompt reco data, a backport to current data-taking release cycle (12_4_X) might be helpful, to have meaningful PF isolation values of reconstructed photons, in all events. \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 19, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1660985372", "deletions": 10, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending", "egamma"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 39120, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 10, "state": "open", "title": "Do NaN-check before accepting a PF candidate for computing photon's isolation", "updated_at": "1661411604", "user": "swagata87"}

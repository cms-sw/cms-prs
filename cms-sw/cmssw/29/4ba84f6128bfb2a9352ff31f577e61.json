The digi morhing code (enabled using `--procModifiers siPixelDigiMorphing`) is disabled by default so no impact is expected on any reconstructed quantities. The PR is primarily intended to fix the bug so that further testing and validation can be done.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nThis PR will be backported to CMSSW_14_0_X and CMSSW_14_1_X.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1732867724", "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1732725394", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "bug-fix", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved", "trk"], "merge_commit_sha": "37e72b517e89142f46e31a95d5f4e7457d68a4e6", "merged_at": "1732867724", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_15_0_X", "number": 46813, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Allow using fake pixels from the digi morphing algorithm as cluster seeds but drop them from final clusters", "updated_at": "1732867725", "user": "ferencek"}

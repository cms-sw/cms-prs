With the opportunity a few constants for the scenario D53 are added to ```ETLDetId``` and ```ETLNumberingScheme```, and the MtdSD test verbosity is improved. While preparing the migration of ```MTDNumberingBuilder``` (to come in a next PR), I realized that even the old basic DD4hep geometry test had occasional problems with the printed strings, but no sign of issue with the computed DetIds or positions (which makes me think this is mostly a printout issue, although I do not fully understand it).\r\nI have refreshed and simplified the test to avoid useless code duplication and multiple output streams, getting the same results.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe standalone ```MTDCommonData``` tests run and produce consistent output.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 10, "closed_at": "1586500515", "comments": 21, "commits": 9, "created_at": "1586269606", "deletions": 389, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "fbddf57851837450c468302b7febab4f45d924c9", "merged_at": "1586500515", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 29407, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "MTD Geometry: DD4hep migration, preliminary update and cleaning of ideal geometry test", "updated_at": "1586500515", "user": "fabiocos"}

The sizes in the definitions of the digi tables already contain the variables but the for loops that fill those tables has hardcoded numbers instead of variables. This is a fix to make the nTS modification from the configuration script to work properly. This change was originally done locally by Alexi Mestvirishvili.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI ran the script in https://gitlab.cern.ch/cmshcal/hcalpfg/hcalnanoprod/-/blob/main/test/globalrun_cfg.py with default inputs and the output file had 3 time slices for HF, as expected. I also ran the script in https://gitlab.cern.ch/cmshcal/hcalpfg/hcalnanoprod/-/blob/main/test/localrun_cfg.py the same way. I edited the line: process.hcalDigiSortedTable.nTS_HF = cms.untracked.uint32(x) with x=6, 8 and 12. The output files from these instances were created with 6, 8 and 12 time slices for HF, respectively.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 264, "comments": 2, "commits": 43, "created_at": "1720461918", "deletions": 6442, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "dqm-pending", "l1-pending", "hlt-pending", "alca-pending", "db-pending", "geometry-pending", "operations-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-rejected", "heterogeneous-pending", "tracking", "trk"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 45401, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "From cmssw 14 0 0", "updated_at": "1720462096", "user": "kaderci-johannes"}

The code providing the same functionality from `MuonAnalysis/MuonAssociators` is used instead. \r\n\r\nBecause `HLTMuonValidtor` creates `HLTMuonPlotter` objects, which in turn consume ESTokens, outside it's constructor (see https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/HLTriggerOffline/Muon/src/HLTMuonValidator.cc#L165), these token have to be fed down the chain of constructors. The machinery for this was added to the implementation of the propagation and matching code in `HLTriggerOffline/Muon` and has now been integrated into the one in  `MuonAnalysis/MuonAssociators` so that all applications of this code can use the same implementation. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nNo changes in results expected. Code passes all unit tests (even though I think the packages in question might not have any) and all tests run with `runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos` path without failure. \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 29, "comments": 4, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1648222522", "deletions": 969, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "l1-pending", "hlt-pending", "analysis-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 37348, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Clean duplicate code in HLTriggerOffline/Muon", "updated_at": "1648243383", "user": "JanFSchulte"}

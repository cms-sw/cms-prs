The cause turned out to be an issue in the unpacker logic, only affecting QIE11 unpacking (which had not been used at all until now). This patch fixes the problem, and it will be added to #14462 for 80X.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1464149452", "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1463946269", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "9851292517f1d7d0ab09d4480d1c1db8393a9723", "merged_at": "1464149452", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 14599, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix QIE11 unpacking bug", "updated_at": "1464149452", "user": "kpedro88"}

This was done by placing a second configuration next to FED, called\nFEDTest and instructing the shifters (already in 2009) to look at\nFEDTest instead of FED. In the meanwhile FED was completely broken and\nFEDTest was partly broken. FEDTest was now fixed in #12240.\nWe placed the contents of FEDTest into FED so that this can be the main\ndefault plot to look at again. We should stop running FEDTest in the\nnear future and adapt the instructions at that moment.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1464851525", "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1447059423", "deletions": 28, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 12317, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Replaced the contents of the fed config by fedtest", "updated_at": "1464851525", "user": "vanbesien"}

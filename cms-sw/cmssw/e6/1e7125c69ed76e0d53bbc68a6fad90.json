This will be follow-up with a ticket CMSHLT (analogous to [CMSHLT-3618](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSHLT-3618) that was done to supply the same for the pp menu `GRun`) \r\nWhenever the input vertex misses the references to constituent tracks, skip the processing and emit a warning (once per job). \r\nThe logic is the same as in \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/4ddd889fcd7688d0d51f25afd1ea6475b9a824ec/DQMOffline/RecoB/plugins/PrimaryVertexMonitor.cc#L415-L435\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n`runTheMatrix.py -l 161.4 -t 4 -j 8 -i all --ibeos` runs fine.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

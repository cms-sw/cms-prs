The new logic avoids introducing many early stop threads, which would be idle due to a thread divergence cut. This increases active threads per warp by 3 times, thus leading to a reduction in T3 and T5 object building time. This PR also deduces repeating codes from T3 building. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis is a purely computational optimization. Validation has been performed to prove that the physics performance doesn't change. \r\nTiming improvement can be seen from T3 and T5 kernels from single stream to multi-streams. single stream sees the most improvement.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1014\" height=\"526\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-09-12 at 11 40 05AM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0239a50a-5391-41ba-9f52-051019d1f304\" />\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 14, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1757688314", "deletions": 518, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "heterogeneous-approved", "tracking"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_0_X", "number": 48909, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 4, "state": "open", "title": "Reshape LST T3 and T5 building kernels in LST to increase the active threads per warp", "updated_at": "1758017116", "user": "YonsiG"}

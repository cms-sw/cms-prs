Configuration is based on same C++ code as Higgs DQM and contains only python configuration.\n\nAlso modifies Higgs DQM code slightly to allow DQM directory name to be configurable. Change was discussed with Higgs DQM developers, Hugues Brun and Sami Lehti.\n\nCurrently contains only single photon paths (proposed by SMP at Oct14 Strasbourg TSG workshop).\n\nAn example output file is here, including the new paths:\n/afs/cern.ch/user/o/olivito/public/dqm/CMSSW_7_3_0_pre1/src/HLTriggerOffline/SMP/test/DQM_SMP_singlephoton_Hggrelval.root\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_3_X", "changed_files": 12, "closed_at": "1415803514", "comments": 22, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1415008790", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "new-package-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "2d7e6a6fb99fabf1ea359964f38a9dc32d407644", "merged_at": "1415803514", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_3_X", "number": 6170, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "SMP HLT DQM, basic config and single photon paths", "updated_at": "1415803514", "user": "olivito"}

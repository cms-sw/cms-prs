This PR targets the particle flow code. It includes several PRs made locally, the details of which can be found in the twiki https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/SWGuideL1TPhase2Instructions and in the cms-l1t-offline branch.\" \r\n\r\nThis version of the PR has the reorganization of the code to have a structure more CMS friendly, and has the previous commits squashed into one for clarity. This is a new PR because the previous one was made under @perrotta 's account, and it is more convenient to move it back to mine if there are follow ups. \r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 168, "comments": 4, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1654105256", "deletions": 3840, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "l1-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 38178, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[L1T] Add PF developments for L1T phase-2", "updated_at": "1654152180", "user": "cecilecaillol"}

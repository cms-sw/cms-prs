It turns out that all other workflows that have `defaultDataSet` set to empty string are `2023` workflows, and for them the input dataset query is explicitly disabled.\r\n\r\nThe proposed fix is to disable the input dataset query for all workflows to which `defaultDataSet` is set to empty string.\r\n\r\nTested in CMSSW_8_1_X_2016-11-03-1100. Expecting to fix `runTheMatrix.py -l 10424.0 -i all`, no changes expected to anything else.\r\n\r\nThanks to @smuzaffar for reporting the problem.\r\n\r\n@smuzaffar @kpedro88 ", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1478361270", "comments": 16, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1478208185", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "pdmv-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "dc1df9f9d3784a3fe91dac03927c12b2e97d466c", "merged_at": "1478361270", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 16460, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix 2017 design workflow for '-i all'", "updated_at": "1478361270", "user": "makortel"}

Increase by about  a strip width at each edge, so this is a small correction (about 2% increase in linear dimensions.)\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1392029369", "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1391442639", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "bc321842bfc71033fe810fd5fc4bab128590a1bf", "merged_at": "1392029369", "merged_by": "nclopezo", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_1_0_pre5", "number": 2275, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "increase me11 sensitive region dimes by ~1/2 strip width at each edge", "updated_at": "1402660827", "user": "ptcox"}

These changes should be in CMSSW_7_3_X and later (pull requests will follow for CMSSW_7_4_Y once this one is accepted).\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_3_X", "changed_files": 19, "closed_at": "1426002319", "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1421250449", "deletions": 336, "labels": ["alca-pending", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_3_X", "number": 7168, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "added missing pixel features from CVS-head", "updated_at": "1426002319", "user": "clelange"}

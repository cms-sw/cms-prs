I did not find a clear way to achieve that (without spending lots of time understanding the details of the workflow generation), so I added a special treatment for premixing stage1 to `WorkFlowRunner`.\r\n\r\nTested in CMSSW_10_2_X_2018-04-12-2300, no changes expected in existing workflows.\r\n\r\n@kpedro88 @mdhildreth ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1524467826", "comments": 15, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1523625149", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "pdmv-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "41be60f6010348e223ea00eddcbf0cc9a980540b", "merged_at": "1524467826", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 22956, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 5, "state": "closed", "title": "Add combined premixing stage1+stage2 workflows for 2016-18", "updated_at": "1524467827", "user": "makortel"}

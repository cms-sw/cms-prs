The code currently in master could possibly pass NaN to TSpline3::Eval which would throw an exception (cf. this report https://github.com/CTPPS/cmssw/issues/38). The proposed fix ensures that NaN are not passed to the Eval method.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nBelow a comparison of several proton-reconstruction quantities and for several periods. Blue: with this PR, red dashed: before this PR. There is no difference.\r\n\r\n![make_cmp](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17830858/56729644-16454e80-6756-11e9-9fa8-2ecc9cb3e871.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1556222065", "comments": 12, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1556182642", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "476b14cd3645ec36727c989a3ca2c9ec101f58a2", "merged_at": "1556222065", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 26530, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "PPS: crash prevention in proton reconstruction", "updated_at": "1556222065", "user": "jan-kaspar"}

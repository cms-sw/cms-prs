It is meant to be merged before we start the HI MC campaign, but is not critical for data taking.\n\nHowever, since we expect to get a new GT with a proper payload soon, I will also make a PR which removes the override so that we will properly pull from the GT.\n\nPersonally, I think that we should merge both PRs at once and just make the new GT quickly, because the current customization settings are junk (before this PR) and then we will get the new conditions right when the new GT shows up without having to wait for yet another PR merge. Others can comment on whether this is a good idea or not.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1447334920", "comments": 12, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1447181315", "deletions": 68, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-pending", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "75cf04a6cc5d8dcd9dabd605b2b9cd7ec1a3c3ed", "merged_at": "1447334919", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 12364, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "Set default HI Stage1 parameters", "updated_at": "1447355262", "user": "richard-cms"}

Differences in trigger object L1/L2 branches are expected.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nWill backport to 124X. Similarly to #39309, #39230 and #39818, this will introduce some differences wrt previously produced nanoV10 samples (both when running in 126X and 124X), but we (XPOG) think the gain of fixing those in prompt nano outweights the cost of introducing these differences. Further, more cleanup on the TriggerObjectTableProducer is planned.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1666976624", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1666934638", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved", "xpog-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "ddcad211f37c5a12e0f1a9557afc2b4322270005", "merged_at": "1666976624", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_6_X", "number": 39893, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Nano: fix matching between pat trigger objects and L1 objects", "updated_at": "1666976624", "user": "swertz"}

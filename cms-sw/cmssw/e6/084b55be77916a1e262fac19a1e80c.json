This will replace the GEMCoPadProcessor in the next PR. The CSCGEMMatcher was extended with the \"COSI\" (consistency of slope index) mechanism, to check that the GEM-CSC bending angle corresponds to the CSC internal slope. This will be used in the GEM-CSC matching soon. The quality assignment and quality control classes were extended to be used with GEMInternalCluster. \r\n\r\nThere are few other minor updates.\r\n* A function in CSCMotherboard was made pass-by-ref instead of pass by value\r\n* LUT generators produce missing index columns and missing headers\r\n\r\nRequires https://github.com/cms-data/L1Trigger-CSCTriggerPrimitives/pull/10\r\n\r\nIn the next PR I should finally remove CSCUpgradeMotherboard, and absorb CSCGEMMotherboardME11 and CSCGEMMotherboardME21 into CSCGEMMotherboard. Ultimately there should be two motherboards remaining (CSCMotherboard and CSCGEMMotherboard) down from 6. I'll also remove GEMCoPadProcessor and CSCUpgradeMotherboardLUT.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRun WF 11634.0.

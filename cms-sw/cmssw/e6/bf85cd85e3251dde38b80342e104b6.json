This was brought into our attention by TSG colleagues and it was causing unrealistic rates when re-emulating data after 2023A. \r\n\r\nThere might be an underlying reason to why this problem started happening, but for the time being we prefer to remove this option and use `unpackHcal` directly. This is more in line with how ECAL TPs are used. The `unpackLayer1` step was probably an artifact from Run 2, which is not needed anymore.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nValidated that the `L1REPACK:Full` workflows still work after the change and the rates obtained are as expected.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

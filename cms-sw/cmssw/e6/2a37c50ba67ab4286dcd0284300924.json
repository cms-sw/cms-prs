This script was *a little bit* outdated (FORTRAN77) and here it is being rewritten to python3 with the same functionality (except the creation of `pdf` files, information which is now being printed directly on the console).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis update was proposed in a [Tracker DPG Meeting](https://indico.cern.ch/event/787654/contributions/3298998/attachments/1786295/2908498/Material_Budget_Categorization.pdf) and results in [the Material budget](https://indico.cern.ch/event/787656/contributions/3331625/attachments/1801554/2938673/FortranToPython_MaterialBudget.pdf) meeting. Validation was performed by comparing the output of pdf files and the new code. We'll keep the FORTRAN file until a full update of the documentation has been done.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 29, "commits": 12, "created_at": "1553781540", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-notrun", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "orp-pending", "tests-rejected"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 26285, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "open", "title": "TrackerCommonData: Categorization script update", "updated_at": "1556049046", "user": "vargasa"}

I am convinced that by regular tiny PRs to the PFProducer/PFAlgo that are easy to review we can on a long term clear up the Particle Flow hairball.\r\n\r\nI suggest here:\r\n  * to replace most loops in PFAlgo with range based loops\r\n  * to replace boost::shared_ptr with std::shared_ptr\r\n  * to remove the PFAlgoTestBench* classes since they are probably not used any more and IMHO not well designed: they had rather special requirements of the class they are testing (vtable, protected member functions) which I consider not a good design. Testing should be independent of implementation. Also, removing these classes makes further refactoring easier because they don't have to be considered. @cbernet, what do you think about this? Are these test benches still needed?\r\n\r\nLocal matrix tests pass.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 11, "comments": 21, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1544083252", "deletions": 764, "labels": ["code-checks-pending", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_4_X", "number": 25432, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 10, "state": "open", "title": "PFAlgo range based loops and TestBench removal", "updated_at": "1544353325", "user": "guitargeek"}

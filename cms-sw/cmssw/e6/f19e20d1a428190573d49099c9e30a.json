If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nNot a backport, it will be backported to (at least) CMSSW_15_1_X for online tests.\r\n\r\nCc: @smorovic ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1758522396", "comments": 10, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1758270091", "deletions": 41, "labels": ["hlt-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved", "hlt-integration"], "merge_commit_sha": "51437cded9d8764898fc426c9bc65d64d5bd769b", "merged_at": "1758522396", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_16_0_X", "number": 48957, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "add support for multiple input FEDs in `HLTL1NumberFilter`", "updated_at": "1758522397", "user": "mmusich"}

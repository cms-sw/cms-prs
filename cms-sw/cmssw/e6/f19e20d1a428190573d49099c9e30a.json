If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nNot a backport, it will be backported to (at least) CMSSW_15_1_X for online tests.\r\n\r\nCc: @smorovic ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1758270091", "deletions": 41, "labels": ["hlt-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_0_X", "number": 48957, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "add support for multiple input FEDs in `HLTL1NumberFilter`", "updated_at": "1758270299", "user": "mmusich"}

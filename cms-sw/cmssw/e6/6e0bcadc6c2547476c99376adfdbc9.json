After that, I produced a new module for producing pre- post- firing plots with a second way using eta/phi map for L1T objects (muon, jet, tau, egamma, MET) for every BX as well as for the first bunch, last bunch and isolated bunch.  \r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 8, "closed_at": "1515520024", "comments": 10, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1513632710", "deletions": 18, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "dqm-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_0_X", "number": 21744, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 37, "state": "closed", "title": "Dedicated Timing Plots - New Settings for uGT and Eta/Phi Map - L1T & Online DQM", "updated_at": "1515520024", "user": "dtsitson"}

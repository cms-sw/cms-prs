Updates to use new fastjet 3.1.0 (https://github.com/cms-externals/fastjet/pull/8)\n2. Updates to new API for n-subjettiness for fastjet-contrib 1.014 (https://github.com/cms-externals/fastjet-contrib/pull/2)\n3. Added changes to PUPPI from the code review here (https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/5500)\n4. Added several new tools, none of which are to be executed in RECO until further notice : \n   - Constituent subtraction\n   - SoftKiller\n   - SoftDrop\n   - PUPPI\n\nTwo notes : \n- There is a new package, CommonTools/PileupModules. It would aid development to have these separate from CommonTools/ParticleFlow (which is focused on the \"top projection\" code). \n- The current output is set up as an intermediate stage where PFCandidates are produced along with a valueMap of four vectors. This is a stand-in until I make a migration to the ThinnedCollection, but this is better treated together rather than piecemeal. \n\nAlso adding @violatingcp and @nhanvtran to watch this. \n\nFinal note : This seems to be stuck \"Checking mergeability...\". I have updated to CMSSW_7_3_X_2014-11-07-0200 and it merges fine, so I presume this is a github issue. \n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_3_X", "changed_files": 165, "closed_at": "1416424709", "comments": 36, "commits": 55, "created_at": "1415371611", "deletions": 2392, "labels": ["alca-pending", "analysis-pending", "comparison-pending", "core-pending", "daq-pending", "db-pending", "dqm-pending", "generators-pending", "new-package-pending", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "tests-rejected"], "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_3_X", "number": 6273, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Major JME developments for 73x", "updated_at": "1416424709", "user": "rappoccio"}

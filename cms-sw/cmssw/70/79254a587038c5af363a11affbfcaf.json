That was always confusing after the third time testing geometry you never knew which one was `_old` and what exactly was `_new`. \r\n\r\n* Some reusable code on `MaterialBudget.py` has been collected into functions to avoid code redundancy. @rovere If you can do a review of this we will greatly appreciate it. \r\n\r\n* Some labels on the plots were restored to make it consistent with existent twiki documentation.\r\n\r\n* Overlapping issues on previous plots were addressed.\r\n\r\nFor details please check commit description\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "comments": 23, "commits": 31, "created_at": "1543532452", "deletions": 1114, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-pending", "geometry-approved", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_4_X", "number": 25382, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Validation/Geometry: Integrate geometry comparison to MaterialBudget.py", "updated_at": "1544037382", "user": "vargasa"}

The increase in data-size should be negligible, thus I did not measure it.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRun\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n#!/bin/bash -ex\r\n\r\ncmsDriver.py testReAlCaHLT \\\r\n\t     -s ALCA:TkAlHLTTracks+TkAlHLTTracksZMuMu  \\\r\n\t     --conditions 150X_dataRun3_HLT_v1 \\\r\n\t     --scenario pp \\\r\n\t     --data \\\r\n\t     --era Run3_2025 \\\r\n\t     --datatier ALCARECO \\\r\n\t     --eventcontent ALCARECO \\\r\n\t     --processName=ReAlCa \\\r\n\t     -n 10000 \\\r\n\t     --dasquery='file dataset=/HLTMonitor/Run2025C-Express-v2/FEVTHLTALL site=T2_CH_CERN' \\\r\n\t     --nThreads 4 >& ReAlCa.log\r\n```\r\n\r\nand inspectied the resulting event conent.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

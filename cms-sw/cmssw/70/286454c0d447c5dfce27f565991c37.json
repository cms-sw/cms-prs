Update of wf 1010.0 to run on data relval key rather than offline key. This will keep intact the offline GT according to the real offline conditions where ECAL Pedestals have time based IOVs. This workflow requires run-based IOVs and I dont think its a good idea to keep mixture of offline and non-offline conditions in run2_data key. run2_data_relval should suffice this.\r\n\r\n2. Update of GT corresponds to run2_data_relval key that includes the ECALPedestal tag from Express/Prompt (this was the way earlier) which is run-based.\r\n\r\nI performed the local checks with : runTheMatrix.py -l 1010.0 --command='-n 1'\r\nand I see no more crashes.\r\n\r\n@argiro @fabozzi \r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1507182323", "comments": 23, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1507091516", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "pdmv-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "087ea8f13472245a9e1289a98b962bd96ad31cc5", "merged_at": "1507182323", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_4_X", "number": 20736, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Update of wf1010.0 and run2_data_relval key", "updated_at": "1507182323", "user": "arunhep"}

Since `MTDGeomDet` currently has functionality identical to `TrackerGeomDet`, this PR makes `MTDGeomDet` a typedef for `TrackerGeomDet`.  If in the future additional functionality is needed in `MTDGeomDet` it can be made a class that inherits from `TrackerGeomDet`.  This resolves issue #28571.\r\n\r\nIn addition, this PR also removes some casts that are unnecessary since `GeomDet` and `GeomDetUnit` are now the same type, and makes a small change to `AlignmentPositionError` in `GeomDet` and  `TrackerGeomDet` to improve encapsulation and reduce code replication.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nA limited matrix was run with no new failures observed.  This is strictly a technical fix that should have no effect on physics results.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 9, "closed_at": "1578421956", "comments": 27, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1575925183", "deletions": 50, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "2dd52eb72a7a222ec1a21a6111438a264162be44", "merged_at": "1578421956", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 28590, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 11, "state": "closed", "title": "Correct MTDGeomDet type problems", "updated_at": "1578421956", "user": "dan131riley"}

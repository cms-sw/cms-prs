Multiple O(log(N)) lookups\r\nof calibration constants (pedestals, gains, channel quality) are\r\nreplaced by a single O(1) lookup into the cache using dense channel\r\nindexing. This results in about 20% increase in the throughput if\r\n\"Method 0\" alone is used for HCAL reco (the speedup is less noticeable\r\nwith MAHI). See\r\n\r\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/918334/contributions/3861974/attachments/2037521/3412046/Igor_DenseIndex.pdf\r\n\r\nThis pull request corresponds to the \"lazy\" version of calibration\r\ninformation lookup (on the first occurrence of the channel in the\r\nrun/lumi section). This type of lookup is slightly more efficient for\r\nprocessing small numbers of events per lumi section, when there is\r\na chance that some channels are never read out.\r\n\r\nThis pull request is not supposed to change any relval results.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe usual runTheMatrix tests were run. Some private modifications\r\nwere also used to print calibration info and to make sure that it is\r\nthe same as before.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1590853740", "comments": 20, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1589549887", "deletions": 40, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 29852, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Linear hbhe channel lookup", "updated_at": "1590853740", "user": "igv4321"}

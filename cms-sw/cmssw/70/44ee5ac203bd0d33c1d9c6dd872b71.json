The changes are listed below.\r\n\r\n- Replaced `cms.InputTag` with regular strings (inside `clone`) in `ALCARECOPPSCalMaxTracks_cff.py`.\r\n- Deleted `hlt_out_singleRAW.py` and `setup_dev_CMSSW_12_1_0_GRun_V14_cff.py`. They were not necessary for the unit tests in the `test` folder.\r\n- Deleted `hltEventAnalyzerAOD` from the `prompt_PPSAlCaReco_output` test. It was not necessary for that test and made the output verbose. Also, there are no `0 accepted 'L3' objects found` messages anymore.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n- The unit tests pass.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 5, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1645622774", "deletions": 7483, "labels": ["alca-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 37048, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "PPSAlCaRecoProducer fixes", "updated_at": "1645623806", "user": "MatiXOfficial"}

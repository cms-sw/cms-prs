To work around this one must get the container\ndirectly and then use the index in the edm::Ref to find the right item in\nthe container. This change does this and properly handles copying from the\nsecondary source to the new edm::Event.\nTrajectorySeeds are not handled by this change, since it was unknown if it\nwould be necessary. If they are needed, the same procedure done for the other\nRefs can be done for them.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1397548264", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1397506643", "deletions": 11, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fastsim-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "81e17d34df6008ff1ea944cd4553133f9702df8c", "merged_at": "1397548264", "merged_by": "nclopezo", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_1_0_pre7", "number": 3335, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fixed problem with edm::Refs from secondary source in RecoTrackAccumulat...", "updated_at": "1402642216", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

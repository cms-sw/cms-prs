The ability to read SLHC11 files is still required because the production GEN-SIM for the Technical Proposal was made with SLHC11.\nThis fix checks the version of CMSSW the input SimHit collection was made with.  If it is SLHC11 or SLHC12 the DetIds are remapped to the new numbering scheme.  If it is anything else the collection is left alone.\n\nPlots below when running on the SLHC production samples, QCD with 140 pileup:\n\nIn both cases blue is with this fix, red is normal SLHC14 running on the SLHC11 files.\n\n**Number of pixel endcap layers per track**\n![numberofpixendcaplayerspertrackvseta](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6480160/3492926/412547be-05b2-11e4-8a33-ee1af9a6ceae.png)\n\n**Number of RecHits per track**\n![goodtracknumberoffoundrechitspertrackvseta](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6480160/3492929/4646b796-05b2-11e4-81e9-d068d38ba8c9.png)\n", "branch": "CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "changed_files": 26, "closed_at": "1405893629", "comments": 4, "commits": 18, "created_at": "1404715291", "deletions": 605, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "Next CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "number": 4541, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Remap forward pixel DetIds in files from from old CMSSW versions", "updated_at": "1405893629", "user": "mark-grimes"}

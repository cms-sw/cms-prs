Specifically, it modifies the LUT for TPs with |ieta|>=21 that have a saturated energy of 64 GeV and changes their energy to 128 GeV so that no TPs underestimate the energy. The studies supporting this change can be seen on slide 10 in the following slides from the L1 trigger workshop: [indico](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1137504/contributions/4811186/attachments/2433047/4166643/L1T_Workshop.pdf).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nA basic technical test was performed: runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nThis PR is not a backport\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1651576282", "comments": 27, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1651252294", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["alca-approved", "l1-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved", "hcal"], "merge_commit_sha": "90892fb0b858942cbbb837bd59d82e4fbdc73e4f", "merged_at": "1651576282", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 37745, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "modify HCAL output LUT for saturated TPs with |ieta|>=21", "updated_at": "1651580143", "user": "Michael-Krohn"}

PhaseI will be easier to migrate still residuals cannot be computed as it stands (caveat: pulls are computed and stored in TrackExtra since ages)\r\n\r\nPIxel DQM is now working using ad-hoc Refit Track", "branch": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "changed_files": 76, "closed_at": "1485892091", "comments": 157, "commits": 73, "created_at": "1482514390", "deletions": 853, "labels": ["alca-pending", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fastsim-pending", "hlt-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved", "visualization-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "556156bd8ab84ee72908923212de71f56331d24a", "merged_at": "1485892091", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "number": 17098, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 38, "state": "closed", "title": "Remove Trajectory from event", "updated_at": "1485934852", "user": "VinInn"}

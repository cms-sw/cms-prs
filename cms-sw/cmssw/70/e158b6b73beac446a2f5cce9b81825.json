This PR removes the instantiation of the class, using the static method instead.\n\nLikewise in high pileup or with fast timing turned on for ECAL, multiple calls to the laser correction service were causing a huge load in the ecal digitizer. This is now fixed with a tactical cache that is updated every event since the corrections are time dependent.\n\nTechnical PR, no changes expected/observed.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1473922821", "comments": 17, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1473792940", "deletions": 9, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "482bb46b0901068d45a7560b4f23a8a5d59e9937", "merged_at": "1473922821", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 15835, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "ECAL Digitizer Optimizations", "updated_at": "1473922821", "user": "lgray"}

I knew that was not the most elegant solution, but since https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/24549 was already a huge PR I accepted it for now. \r\n\r\nHere I propose a better solution with is to rewrite trackerStablePhiSort and mtdStablePhiSort in a way that they can take arbitrary function objects, including normal functions and lambdas. Basically the same as I did here https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/25080 for the precomputed_value_sort.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 12, "comments": 10, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1541937758", "deletions": 339, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "geometry-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_4_X", "number": 25196, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "open", "title": "Updated trackerStablePhiSort and mtdStablePhiSort", "updated_at": "1542023213", "user": "guitargeek"}

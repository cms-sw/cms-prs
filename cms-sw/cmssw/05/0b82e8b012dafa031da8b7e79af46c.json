I knew that was not the most elegant solution, but since https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/24549 was already a huge PR I accepted it for now. \r\n\r\nHere I propose a better solution with is to rewrite trackerStablePhiSort and mtdStablePhiSort in a way that they can take arbitrary function objects, including normal functions and lambdas. Basically the same as I did here https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/25080 for the precomputed_value_sort.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 19, "closed_at": "1542383160", "comments": 27, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1541937758", "deletions": 391, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "02136f939066c00bc8effe25028b09e9776318bd", "merged_at": "1542383160", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_4_X", "number": 25196, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 13, "state": "closed", "title": "Updated trackerStablePhiSort and mtdStablePhiSort", "updated_at": "1542383161", "user": "guitargeek"}

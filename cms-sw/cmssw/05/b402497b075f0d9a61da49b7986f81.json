This revealed dependencies in `PATIsolatedTrackProducer`, `PackedCandidateTrackValidator`, and ML b and tau taggers.\r\n\r\nThe tracking-related parts affected by the change:\r\n- `PATIsolatedTrackProducer::produce` and `IsolatedTrack` will now have a value saved in `dzError` matching the meaning.\r\n    - using the same short matrix check with a throw in `IsolatedTrack::dzError` I did not detect anything using this method in the matrix tests.\r\n- DQM/TrackingMonitor/src/PackedCandidateTrackValidator.cc :  `diffDszError` which compares `Track::dszError` should still match the candidate by now using directly `dszError` and `diffDzError` should match as well\r\n\r\nThis PR keeps ML b and tau taggers behavior unchanged, to keep values consistent with the training.\r\n @cms-sw/btv-pog-l2 @cms-sw/tau-pog-l2 \r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 8, "comments": 38, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1722462791", "deletions": 37, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "reconstruction-approved", "pending-signatures", "tests-rejected", "orp-pending", "bug-fix", "code-checks-rejected", "xpog-pending", "tracking", "changes-dataformats"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_0_X", "number": 45612, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "update PackedCandidate::dzError to return what it should in track parameterization", "updated_at": "1757484231", "user": "slava77"}

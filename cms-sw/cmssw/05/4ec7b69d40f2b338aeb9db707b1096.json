It is similar to PR #16968 which was intended for standalone application by users (and that is still under review). This one modifies the EGM reco sequence, so changes are expected in the validation plots, specially in plots related to electron and photon energy. This PR depends on the PR #17048, which I believe has already been merged, with the new name convention for the regressions in the GlobalTag. I've tested locally in details with workflow 250200.0 and the results were good.\r\n\r\nAtt: @fcouderc ", "branch": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1487029660", "comments": 29, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1482947049", "deletions": 328, "labels": ["comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "number": 17101, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 15, "state": "closed", "title": "New style GEDelectron and GEDphoton regressions to EGM reco sequence in 90X", "updated_at": "1487029660", "user": "rafaellopesdesa"}

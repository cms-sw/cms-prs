HLT has noticed problems regarding the L1TRawToDigi process, which has been tracked to an issue in the GlobalAlgBlk unpacker receiving blocks and header IDs out of order. This causes a bad access/->at call,of a following BXVector, which fails somewhat un-informatively. This PR has been opened to produce a more informative failure message in case the initial header ID assumption fails.\r\n> \r\n> @dinyar @kbunkow @missirol @alintulu I figured you would like to be kept in the loop on this.\r\n> \r\n\r\n### PR validation:\r\n\r\n> All code compiles, has had code-formatting applied, and passes code checks. When testing on error events from [the open JIRA ticket](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSLITOPS-411), the std::runtime_error reports instead of bad vector access errors.\r\n\r\n### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nThis PR is a backport of #41401. This PR has been backported to eventually help HLT identify this error in datataking at P5 and identify if this is the only error observed right now in 2023 data-taking for the uGT unpacker. This backport is intended for CMSSW_13_0/2023 data-taking releases.\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 6, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1682420147", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["l1-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "backport"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "number": 41402, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[13_0_X] Update GlobalAlgBlkUnpacker to throw error in the case of headers received in the wrong order", "updated_at": "1682422770", "user": "aloeliger"}

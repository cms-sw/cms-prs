ROOT does not use u or l qualifiers for the names of integer template parameters in class names. Because of this, a missing dictionary error resulted when attempting put an SMatrix into an event.  This pull request adds stripping off the \"u\" or \"l\" qualifiers in class names containing integer template parameters, thereby correcting the error. \nThis is the pull request for the CMSSW_7_4_ROOT6_X branch only.  The same fix was requested for 7_4_X in a different pull request, due to previous differences in the two branches.\nPlease merge this request as soon as convenient.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_ROOT6_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1423259036", "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1423252804", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "core-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "61954498e1046cb46c984c89877b4bf40375196e", "merged_at": "1423259036", "merged_by": "ktf", "number": 7607, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "ROOT does not use u or l qualifiers for template paramaters in class nam...", "updated_at": "1423259316", "user": "wmtan"}

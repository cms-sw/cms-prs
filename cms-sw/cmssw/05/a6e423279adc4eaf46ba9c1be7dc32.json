The ROIs are formed from tracks found by previous iterations, and they are tagged with an MVA that helps to reduce the CPU time. The tagged ROIs are used as tracking regions for the new iteration.\r\n\r\nSeveral presentations have been made regarding the new iteration, most recently in the TRK POG meeting here:\r\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/961478/#5-displaced-tracking-ml-develo\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nWe see a useful increase in tracking efficiency for highly displaced tracks from at least two different exotic physics models (see above presentation for details). This is accompanied by a modest increase in the CPU time of _just the tracking sequence_ of ~7%.\r\n\r\nThe usual code formatting checks have been also been run.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 30, "closed_at": "1626748457", "comments": 68, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1612371699", "deletions": 29, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "dqm-approved", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-rejected", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "number": 32806, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 163, "state": "closed", "title": "EXO regional tracking iteration", "updated_at": "1626748457", "user": "aehart"}

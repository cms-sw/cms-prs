This was originally done to work around a shortcoming in how `scram` handled the `python/` directory of CMSSW packages (see [this HN thread](https://hypernews.cern.ch/HyperNews/CMS/get/sw-develtools/1894.html) for more details).\r\n\r\nTesting in a recent CMSSW release suggests that this workaround is not necessary anymore, so this PR removes the 'dummy' `python/` directories in `HLTrigger/`.\r\n\r\nMerely technical. No changes expected.\r\n\r\nPS.

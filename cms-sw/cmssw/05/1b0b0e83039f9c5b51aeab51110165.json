This was originally done to work around a shortcoming in how `scram` handled the `python/` directory of CMSSW packages (see [this HN thread](https://hypernews.cern.ch/HyperNews/CMS/get/sw-develtools/1894.html) for more details).\r\n\r\nTesting in a recent CMSSW release suggests that this workaround is not necessary anymore, so this PR removes the 'dummy' `python/` directories in `HLTrigger/`.\r\n\r\nMerely technical. No changes expected.\r\n\r\nPS. It looks like the relevant updates for `scram` were in [[1]](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw-config/blob/3c8d41b9027818345f478f3f0f0c109a59a101da/ChangeLog#L875) [[2]](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw-config/pull/40), but I do not know that for a fact.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n`addOnTests` passed.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nN/A", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1641234143", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["hlt-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 36625, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "removed dummy `python/` dirs in `HLTrigger/`", "updated_at": "1641466665", "user": "missirol"}

These can cause crashes when FEDs 1134 and 1135 are included in runs. (The previous PRs fixed most of these, but I unfortunately discovered a few more cases.)\r\n- As zero suppression to emulated TPs, to match what is done in data TPs.\r\n- PedestalTask has a filter to skip the laser/CRF/calibration channels crate. This was moved from crate 36 to 38, so the filter is updated accordingly (note that crate 36 is not in use anymore).\r\n- Small plot adjustments: fN_to4000 changed to fN_to8000 (this is used only to set the y-range for profile plots, so doesn't add bins), and fEtCorr_256 is changed from [-2,256] to [-1, 257] so that saturated bins aren't right on the edge. \r\n\r\nThis PR does not add any extra bins.

If the simulated samples are reproduced (as in standalone and PR tests), only the workflow 27634.21 will fail, and the failure due to the missing MinBias input for PU has been verified already to be solved by the reverted change.\r\n\r\nThe plan is to produce the required input RelVal, and then revert this PR.

Note: A cherry-picked subset of this PR is the Muon-only PR #19102, \r\n\r\nNumber of files changed 59\r\n- 37 source code files\r\n- 22 configuration python files, most not used by default, useful to developers\r\n\r\nContains developments between tag v94.0 and v95.7 from l1t-integration-CMSSW_9_2_0 integration branch. Documented in detail in [twiki](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/SWGuideL1TOfflineDev#Status_of_Integration) most notably:\r\n- BMTF: improved eta assignment leading to 50% better resolution w.r.t. GEN.  Moved LUTs into L1Trigger/L1TMuon. ( (cms-data/L1Trigger-L1TMuon#11).\r\n- New uGMT extrapolation LUTs 20170505. These take the BMTF eta scale fix into account. This needs the external Muons data. (cms-data/L1Trigger-L1TMuon#10)\r\n- EG - new extended H/E, plus 2nd isolation WP (aka 2016)\r\n- MET Emulator bug fix when getting address using ieta for MET PUS LUT. Emulator was counting from 0, firmware was counting from 1.\r\n- Introduce a new caloParams2017_v1_7 to reflect current online conditions. (cms-data/L1Trigger-L1TCalorimeter#19)\r\n- Saturate MET when there is a saturated ECAL or HCAL TP\r\n- Adds a caloParams_2017_v1_8_2, enabling the 2nd iso EG WP.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith respect to PR #19084, this PR is more complete, and it contains one package less:\r\nBMTF LUTs are moved to the correct directory (L1Trigger/L1TMuon) and code is self-contained in L1Trigger/L1TMuonBarrel package.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 59, "closed_at": "1497850286", "comments": 7, "commits": 88, "created_at": "1496739694", "deletions": 267, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "l1-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_9_2_X", "number": 19104, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Pr92x upto l1t integration v95.7", "updated_at": "1497850287", "user": "rekovic"}

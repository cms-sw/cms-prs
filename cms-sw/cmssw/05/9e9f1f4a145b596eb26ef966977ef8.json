Resolves #29306 .\r\n\r\nFurthermore, this PR modernizes the skeleton templates by accounting the code formatting as much as feasible (some empty lines turned out to be difficult to avoid without touching the generation code itself), and by modernizing the code overall (range-for, consumes, `=delete`) following suggestions in #26618.\r\n\r\nThe EventHypothesis template and `mkevhyp` script are removed as obsolete as agreed in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/29834.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe scripts run (except for `mktmpl`, which appears to be broken already in 10_2_X).", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 78, "closed_at": "1589515807", "comments": 22, "commits": 18, "created_at": "1589460293", "deletions": 1159, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "f9de0744cf183f8f41d8dd4b17df8b6982d4e233", "merged_at": "1589515807", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 29840, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 5, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix and modernize Skeleton template scripts", "updated_at": "1589515808", "user": "makortel"}

Also \"cmsRun jettoolbox_cfg.py\" will work perfectly once I have the payloads uploaded to the database.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1421274039", "comments": 9, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1421246360", "deletions": 30, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "740af0f81f2c2fcdfc915c6f0a7a827ff970694b", "merged_at": "1421274039", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 7166, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Qg small updates", "updated_at": "1421274039", "user": "UAEDF-tomc"}

The reference needs to be updated in the ```cms-data``` area to have a successful completion of the unit test.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": "1732174578", "comments": 18, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1731428252", "deletions": 581, "labels": ["geometry-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "upgrade-approved", "requires-external", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "77901ab0d18bdeaa60110351f77ac14218b39086", "merged_at": "1732174578", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_14_2_X", "number": 46683, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "MTD geometry: update MTDGeometry test, use only DD4hep backend, add ETL pixel position test", "updated_at": "1732174580", "user": "fabiocos"}

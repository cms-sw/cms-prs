The reference needs to be updated in the ```cms-data``` area to have a successful completion of the unit test.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 7, "comments": 4, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1731428252", "deletions": 581, "labels": ["geometry-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "upgrade-pending", "requires-external", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_2_X", "number": 46683, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "MTD geometry: update MTDGeometry test, use only DD4hep backend, add ETL pixel position test", "updated_at": "1731428448", "user": "fabiocos"}

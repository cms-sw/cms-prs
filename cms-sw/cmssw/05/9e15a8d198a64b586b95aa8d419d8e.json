I'll try to fix this by growing it, there should be space for it. **Done**, CF sheet updated to real size. No overlaps now as far as I see.\n\nTo be fixed here or in another PR:\n- Material mixtures should have the right components, but all mixtures/densities need to be checked.\n\n@ianna : comments very welcome.\n@davidlange6 : This PR seems ready to be merged to me. Update: still true, changing numbers can be a separate PR.\n\nAlso @veszpv , @friccita .\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 12, "closed_at": "1477845060", "comments": 56, "commits": 12, "created_at": "1477379806", "deletions": 39, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "59bb0b623bef095ed2041c25901d3dca8a9b19a2", "merged_at": "1477845060", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 16338, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "Updated Forward Pixel Geometry: flex cables, CF sheet, support arms, cooling tubes", "updated_at": "1477847135", "user": "schneiml"}

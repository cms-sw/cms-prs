Particles and vertices are stored separately in an ordered graph structure; all custom iterators were removed.\r\n2.  Extension on the I/O functionality of the library.\r\n \r\n[*] https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/SWGuideCreatingNewProducts\r\n[**] https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/1525/1/012017/pdf\r\n\r\nThe HepMC3 new data format poses challenges on defining the corresponding EDMProduct definition.\r\n\r\nThis PR depicts partial implementation, due to some technical error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nError: Class shared_ptr<HepMC3::GenParticle> has been selected but currently the support for its I/O is not yet available. Note that shared_ptr<HepMC3::GenParticle>, even if not selected, will be available for interpreted code.\r\nError: Class shared_ptr<HepMC3::GenVertex> has been selected but currently the support for its I/O is not yet available. Note that shared_ptr<HepMC3::GenVertex>, even if not selected, will be available for interpreted code.\r\n```\r\nI am looking for advice(s) on how to solve the error. @smuzaffar, @mkirsano \r\n\r\nNote: class version will be done accordingly after a successful compilation with the amended version classes_def.xml.\r\n\r\nRelated Issue/PR:\r\n1.

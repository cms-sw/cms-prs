Some fine tuning of the number of blocks allocated to each kernel (even just one block?) makes this PR at least as fast as the standard multi-kernel implementation. \r\n\r\nMore comments inline. \r\n\r\nThe code is \"configured\" to run with cooperative groups: of course the actual PR can be merged with the standard multi-kernel implementation as default.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 27, "comments": 70, "commits": 30, "created_at": "1634540249", "deletions": 191, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "heterogeneous-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 35713, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 34, "state": "open", "title": "Use cooperative groups to populate Associations (Histograms) in Pixel Patatrack", "updated_at": "1639163593", "user": "VinInn"}

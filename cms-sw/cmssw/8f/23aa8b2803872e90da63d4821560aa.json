Nothing is changed unless the `run2` era is explicitly activated.\n\nTwo points:\n- [EDIT - this point no longer relevant] `process.genMixPileUpFiles` is not created. It's not easy to create brand new parameters with an era and I couldn't see it used anywhere.  Is it definitely required?\n- I think there's a bug in the original customisation.  The line [SLHCUpgradeSimulations/Configuration/python/fastSimCustoms.py#L11](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/CMSSW_7_4_X/SLHCUpgradeSimulations/Configuration/python/fastSimCustoms.py#L11) doesn't do anything.  The correct path is `famosPileUp.PileUpSimulatorBlock.PileUpSimulator` not `famosPileUp.PileUpSimulator` (see [PileUpProducer_cff.py](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/CMSSW_7_4_X/FastSimulation/PileUpProducer/python/PileUpProducer_cff.py)).  The (what I consider) correct path is used here.\n\nTesting has been limited.  I just made sure the files can be parsed properly since nothing is changed if the era is not active.  I'll worry about ensuring identity between the two methods (customisation versus era) once all the pull requests are in.\n\nAlso, I haven't taken the customisations out of the run2 helper function [customiseRun2EraExtras](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/CMSSW_7_4_X/SLHCUpgradeSimulations/Configuration/python/postLS1Customs.py#L233). The postLS1Customs.py file is being heavily modified by #7579, and this would likely cause a conflict.  Applying the modification twice has no harm so I'll remove those lines in a later pull request.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": "1423764835", "comments": 19, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1423657278", "deletions": 25, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fastsim-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "f6b8283dfc5416fafa39a108db22c1dc7e3375d2", "merged_at": "1423764835", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 7672, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add FastSim changes to the run2 era", "updated_at": "1423773149", "user": "mark-grimes"}

In PR #31780, the obsolete records needed to be removed from all GTs in autoCond, including the Run 3 prompt GTs. But since the 11_1_X release series is currently used for online data taking, `auto:run3_data_promptlike` is an 11_1_X GT. Therefore, for bookkeeping consistency, the change should be backported to 11_1_X.\r\n\r\nThis change is purely technical and no changes in any distribution are expected from this change. The GT diff is as follows:\r\n\r\n**Run 3 data (prompt)**\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/111X_dataRun3_Prompt_v2/111X_dataRun3_Prompt_v4\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n`runTheMatrix.py -l 138.1 --ibeos`\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with any link to  -->\r\n\r\nThis PR corresponding to the portion of #31780 that should be backported.\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1605016774", "comments": 10, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1604980582", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["alca-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "b96b2a6a3b95366face2f08a75de3f8ca26c1a18", "merged_at": "1605016774", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 32074, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Remove obsolete records [11_1_X]", "updated_at": "1605016775", "user": "christopheralanwest"}

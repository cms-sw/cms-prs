This makes sense for the primary use in the mixing module; however, SiStripSpyEventMatcher depends on the old behavior.  This PR adds an option (recycleFiles, defaults to true) that restores the old behavior when turned off, and modifies the SiStripSpyEventMatcher cfi to set recycleFiles to false.  Fixes issue #20361 \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 50, "closed_at": "1504883964", "comments": 25, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1504701106", "deletions": 273, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "core-approved", "dqm-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "76961d8a9418bc98f493c045518a4d665ed77ecc", "merged_at": "1504883964", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_4_X", "number": 20403, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "add option for sequential RootEmbeddedFileSequence to not recycle files", "updated_at": "1505217549", "user": "dan131riley"}

The ParticleNet tagger uses a [novel graph neural network architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08570) and shows significant performance improvement compared to the DeepAK8 algorithm. Two versions are provided: the nominal version (`pfParticleNetJetTags`) is a multi-class tagger for Top, W, Z, Higgs and their various decay modes, with very strong performance but features strong mass sculpting. The mass-decorrelated version (`pfMassDecorrelatedParticleNetJetTags`) is a generic two-prong tagger for X->bb, X->cc, and X->qq. It is trained w/ a special signal sample generated with a flat mass spectrum for the signal\r\nparticle (X) and shows substantial improvement in both discrimination power and mass decorrelation compared to the mass-decorrelated DeepAK8 tagger. The performance of the ParticleNet tagger is summarized in the DP note ([DP-2020/002](https://cds.cern.ch/record/2707946/files/DP2020_002.pdf)) and presentations in the [JME](https://indico.cern.ch/event/867397/contributions/3663927/attachments/1960091/3257280/ParticleNet_JMAR_20191210_H_Qu.pdf) and the [BTV](https://indico.cern.ch/event/868673/contributions/3671036/attachments/1960696/3258484/ParticleNet_BTV_20191211_H_Qu.pdf) groups.\r\n\r\nNeeds https://github.com/cms-data/RecoBTag-Combined/pull/26.\r\n\r\nThe current implementation is based on MXNet. Conversion to ONNX is not successful due to the complexity of the graph neural network architecture. The inference w/ MXNet takes \\~60ms per AK8 jet per tagger (nominal and mass-decorrelated), or \\~50ms/evt in total on a ttbar sample -- once we solve https://github.com/cms-sw/cmsdist/issues/5528. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nImplementation of this PR has been verified with the training framework and shows consistent results.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 12, "closed_at": "1583825703", "comments": 74, "commits": 9, "created_at": "1581335979", "deletions": 25, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "requires-external", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "c1ef8454804e4ebea8b65f59c4a952a6c94fde3b", "merged_at": "1583825703", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 28902, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 47, "state": "closed", "title": "MXNet-based implementation of the ParticleNet tagger", "updated_at": "1583872074", "user": "hqucms"}

If the number of chambers is in the range of Run 3 condition, it allows to dump the demonstrator chamber which has layer number 2 without layer 1.\r\n* In the 2024, we had 3 installed GE21 chambers. So the range is set as less than 4.\r\n* In the 2025, we are planning to install 4 more chambers, so we need to increase the range.\r\n* The update only works when we create the GEMRecoGeometryRcd, we don't expect any changes in the test or central production.\r\n* related PR : #44429 \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n* The geometry tag is created with the `CondTools/Geometry/test/gemgeometrywriter.py`, and we tested the geometry from the tag.\r\n* Without this update, the created geometry tag does not include the GE21 demonstrator. However, after the update, we could dump the GE21 demonstrator in the `GEMRecoGeometryRcd`.\r\n\r\n@watson-ij ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 10, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1734506971", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["geometry-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_0_X", "number": 47007, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[GEM] Allow storing 2025 geometry in GEMGeometryParsFromDD", "updated_at": "1736783992", "user": "yeckang"}

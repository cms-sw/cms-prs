This should allow us a minimal code formatting change with new LLVM 21.\r\n\r\n\r\nWithout this change  clang format form LLVM21 will try to format nearly all files. This should go in 23h00 IB so that new LLVM21 only suggest minimal changes (only order of 100 files should be re-formatted with new LLVVM21 and this change)", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1770391870", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["core-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_1_X", "number": 50060, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Enable DerivePointerAlignment in clang-format", "updated_at": "1770402463", "user": "smuzaffar"}

The other `testTF*CUDA` tests were passing silently using the CPU to run the test.  After this PR all the TF sessions using  `tf::backend::cuda` , but  not founding a GPU will fail explicitly. \r\n\r\n- This PR is needed to continue the integration of CUDA 12.4 in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmsdist/pull/9046. \r\n- This PR needs https://github.com/cms-sw/cmsdist/pull/9066 (thanks to @smuzaffar https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/44376#issuecomment-1992693414)", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 14, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1710239054", "deletions": 113, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "hold", "code-checks-approved", "ml-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 44376, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "open", "title": "Improve handling of TF CUDA tests for 14_1_X", "updated_at": "1710282049", "user": "valsdav"}

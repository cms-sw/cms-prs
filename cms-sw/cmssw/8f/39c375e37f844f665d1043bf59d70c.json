It includes a\ntypedef for replacing log4cplus, and copies the toString function from\ntoolbox.\n\nMost of the changes introduced in this patch are revertible at compile\ntime by passing the definition \"HAVE_XDAQ\" to the compiler.\n\nA summary of the changes follows:\n- log4cplus/logger has been replaced with an ostream\n- toolbox::toString has been copied into xdaq_compat.h\n- xgi/Utils.h was unused and so removed\n- Fix inheritance problem from std::exception\n  \n  std::exception defines `virtual ~Exception() throw()`, whereas the\n  hcal::exception::Exception was trying to overwrite this with `virtual\n  ~Exception {}`. This lead to a \"looser throw specifier\" error. As the\n  derived class has no reason to redefine this method, it had been\n  removed.\n\nThis is a forward port of cms-sw/cmssw#737.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 25, "closed_at": "1378984100", "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1378979710", "deletions": 75, "labels": ["fully-signed"], "merge_commit_sha": "a7d21d3c66a47e38bd5b481841856653e4fcdfa9", "merged_at": "1378984100", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_0_0_pre4", "number": 804, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Remove dependency on XDAQ from HcalOnlineDb", "updated_at": "1378984105", "user": "ktf"}

The BTV POG wants to have them into the release but not in the standard production for future deployment studies.\r\n\r\nThe BTV group will take care of enabling the taggers for a BTV only dedicated production.\r\n\r\nIn order to test, expand the configuration RecoBTag/ONNXRuntime/test/test_deep_vertexcomb_cfg.py\r\nand turn to \"True\" the switches \"compute_probabilities\" and  \"run_deepVertex\", which are set by default to \"False\" (module pfDeepFlavourTagInfos).

This would supersede https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/49020 solving the same issue:\r\n\r\n> Lately (with https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/48490), spurious DAS errors appear frequently in the tests (see e.g. https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/49014#issuecomment-3344368295). This is due to random glitches in accessing https://cms-service-dqmdc.web.cern.ch/CAF/certification/ when running the tests (no access to EOS is available). This results in not finding any certification JSON files to use for skimming the datasets.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRunning the standard tests.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1759427995", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_0_X", "number": 49051, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Reading Certification JSON from `cvmfs` in `das-up-to-nevents.py`", "updated_at": "1759428025", "user": "AdrianoDee"}

Because of the cluster splitting done in the initialStepPreSplitting iteration, it uses different pixel clusters (`siPixelClustersPreSplitting`) than the rest of the iterations (`siPixelClusters`). However, for the validation only a single the cluster->TrackingParticle mapping (`tpClusters` product) is created with the `siPixelClusters` as an input. When this mapping is queried in QuickTrackAssociatorByHits, there is no check for the `ProductID` of the (pixel) `OmniClusterRef`. In other words, for an `OmniClusterRef` from `siPixelClustersPreSplitting`, take the index of the `Ref` and check if an `OmniClusterRef` from `siPixelClusters` with the same index is matched to a TrackingParticle.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the problem in the following way\r\n* Store the key `ProductID`s in `ClusterTPAssociation`, and check it when querying for matching TrackingParticles\r\n   * This required adding dictionary for `edm::VecArray<ProductID, 2>`\r\n* Add a second instance of the cluster->TP mapping (`tpClustersPreSplitting`) for the PreSplitting clusters, and add an additional MTV instance only for the initialStepPreSplitting tracks.\r\n   * This means that the `initialStepPreSplitting` gets removed from the summary plots for seeds and built tracks\r\n   * I also moved all the producers to Tasks to make sure that they're always run unscheduled\r\n\r\n Tested in CMSSW_10_4_0_pre2, expecting changes in MTV seeding and built tracks summary and initialStepPreSplitting plots.\r\n\r\n@VinInn @mtosi @JanFSchulte @hajohajo", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 9, "comments": 7, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1543248452", "deletions": 113, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "core-pending", "dqm-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_4_X", "number": 25346, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Fix MTV validation of initialStepPreSplitting tracks", "updated_at": "1543259668", "user": "makortel"}

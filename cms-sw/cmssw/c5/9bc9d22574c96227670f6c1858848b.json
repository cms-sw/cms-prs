This is achieved by extracting features from the KF track used in the `ElectronSeed` step (obtained from the available `generalTracks` collection in AOD), instead of from the KF track embedded in the `GsfElectronCore` object (which is chosen based on number of shared hits with the `GsfTrack` and obtained from the missing `generalTracksBeforeMixing` collection in AOD). \r\n- All development was performed in the 10_6_X cycle (see the compare [here](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/compare/CMSSW_10_6_X...bainbrid:LowPtElectrons_ULFastSimFix_106X)), tested with the example recipes provided in the issue [#34774](#34774), and then ported to master (this PR).\r\n- Also tested is the behaviour for the nano v9 workflow, which is similarly affected.\r\n- This work was presented to RECO/AT here: https://indico.cern.ch/event/1071803/. The final slide compares physics performance b/w the 10_6_X and 12_1_X cycles (essentially identical).\r\n- Physics and computing performances are ~unaffected. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis PR was validated using cmsDriver commands that performed the GEN->AOD and mini v2 steps, based on those provided [here](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/34774#issue-960576497), for tests with the 10_6_X cycle, and modified versions for tests with the 12_1_X release (this PR). \r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nThis PR is a back port of #35181.\r\n\r\n@slava77 @jordan-martins @crovelli \r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 9, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1632128610", "deletions": 21, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 35341, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "open", "title": "LowPtElectrons: fix for UL FastSim mini v2 and nano v9 workflows (back port)", "updated_at": "1632302848", "user": "bainbrid"}

It was found that events pass both paths and use the triplet filter in the expected way (cross-cleaning a RecoEcalCandidate from two PFJets). \r\n\r\nNB: It wasn't obvious to me this was the case at first, but using the same EDFilter module for both electrons and photons is in-line with existing HLT paths and code (see the Ele-Tau cross trigger, which uses a HLT2PhotonTau EDFilter in its cross-cleaning module, hltOverlapFilterIsoEle24IsoTau30WPTightGsfCaloJet5).\r\n\r\n#### Backport\r\nmaster PR is https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/40994\r\nIt's necessary to Backport this change as current testing and HLT development is taking place in CMSSW_13_0_0\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 2, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1678271075", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["hlt-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "number": 40991, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Extend HLT plugins HLTDoubletSingle to use DoublePFJetPhoton", "updated_at": "1678281261", "user": "brallmond"}

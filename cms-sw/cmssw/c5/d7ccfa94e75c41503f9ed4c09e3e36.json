Added possibility to save secondaries not only inside tracker, calorimeter and muon system but everywhere. The last is need for exotics simulation. The default region for secondaries is tracker. \n\nThis fix reduces number of SimTracks by factor 10 for MinBias events and correspondingly reduces number of TrackingParticles.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1395605287", "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1395600238", "deletions": 24, "labels": ["fully-signed", "simulation-approved", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "3468464dcd19045442fbad77b020433d33e01bbd", "merged_at": "1395605287", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_1_0_pre5", "number": 2985, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fixed list of SimTracks - removed low-energy secondaries", "updated_at": "1405343128", "user": "civanch"}

The producer will be used in DoubleTau+VBF-jets trigger paths as replacement of the currently used PFJet-PFTau overlap filter. It is estimated that the new producer will allow to increase efficiency of the trigger by ~10% for the same rate compared to triggers with currently used overlap filter.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested with dedicated configuration containing HLT paths using the new module.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 7, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1646214350", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["hlt-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 37116, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 38, "state": "open", "title": "Add PFDiJetCorrCheckerWithDiTau producer for DoubleTau+VBF-jets HLT paths", "updated_at": "1646244055", "user": "mbluj"}

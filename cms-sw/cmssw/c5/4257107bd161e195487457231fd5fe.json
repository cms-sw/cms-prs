The producer will be used in DoubleTau+VBF-jets trigger paths as replacement of the currently used PFJet-PFTau overlap filter. It is estimated that the new producer will allow to increase efficiency of the trigger by ~10% for the same rate compared to triggers with currently used overlap filter.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested with dedicated configuration containing HLT paths using the new module.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1646351693", "comments": 15, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1646214350", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["hlt-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "40644baf85edb3d5ae0a647e3aad43e092692391", "merged_at": "1646351693", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 37116, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 38, "state": "closed", "title": "Add PFDiJetCorrCheckerWithDiTau producer for DoubleTau+VBF-jets HLT paths", "updated_at": "1646351693", "user": "mbluj"}

This is extremely intrusive and breaks encapsulation.\n\nThis does not work anymore with new libstdc++ libraries, because foward\ndelcaration of struct is implicitly private and then implementation is\nunder explicit private clause. Redefining 'private' only change one of\nthem thus creating compile-time errors in sstream.\n\nDetails in PR65899 (GCC BZ). It's WONTFIX.\n\nSuch cleanups are required for GCC 5 and above.\n\nThe files in this PR used such intrusive macros, but removal of them\nbreaks compilation. Thus additional review and refactoring is required\nfor droping intrusive macros. This PR acts as a cleanup list.\n\nMost of such things (about 35 out of 45) are used in tests.\n\nSigned-off-by: David Abdurachmanov David.Abdurachmanov@cern.ch\nAutomatically ported from CMSSW_7_6_X #11520 (original by @davidlt).\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 45, "closed_at": "1445260443", "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1445235476", "deletions": 141, "labels": ["alca-pending", "analysis-pending", "comparison-pending", "core-pending", "db-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending", "visualization-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 11939, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Intrusive 'private' and 'protected' macros (cleanup list)", "updated_at": "1445260443", "user": "cmsbuild"}

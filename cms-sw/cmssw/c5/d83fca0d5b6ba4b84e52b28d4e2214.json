By mistake, the class using them held them by auto_ptr, which caused their deletion while they were still being used, thereby causing segfaults.\n\nWith this fix, many relvals (perhaps all) still fail, but later in their execution for errors unrelated to the\ncurrent segfaults.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_ROOT6_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1391150153", "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1391136529", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["db-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "46cb233139fa49ab480a75f9a3150d044264a81c", "merged_at": "1391150153", "merged_by": "ktf", "number": 2254, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "TVirtualCollectionProxy is owned by ROOT.

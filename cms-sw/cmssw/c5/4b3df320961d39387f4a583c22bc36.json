I started from om schneiml:dqm-remove-blocking-modules and brought back RPC and AlCaBeamMonitor which were fixed in between.\r\n\r\nThis PR removes (some?) of the remaining modules blocking concurrent lumisections in production jobs.\r\n\r\nA random 136 relval with concurrent lumis enabled gave these modules reported:\r\n\r\n  EcalDQMonitorTask ecalMonitorTask\r\n  ESIntegrityTask ecalPreshowerIntegrityTask\r\n  L1TStage2CaloLayer1 l1tStage2CaloLayer1\r\n\r\n\r\nOverall, some of these modules are quite important and we don't want to merge this PR. But it gives an idea of what these modules do and allows to try actually enabling concurrent lumis.\r\n\r\n(@silviodonato update:\r\nRPCDcsInfo rpcDcsInfo updated with #31056\r\nALCARECOTkAlMinBiasDCSFilter -> updated with #30124\r\n)\r\n\r\n(@jfernan2 update 20/10/2020\r\n  EcalDQMonitorTask ecalMonitorTask   fixed by https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/31689\r\n  ESIntegrityTask ecalPreshowerIntegrityTask   fixed by https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/31829\r\n  L1TStage2CaloLayer1 l1tStage2CaloLayer1   fixed by https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/31678\r\n)\r\nPR validation:\r\n\r\nNone, so far; not supposed to be merged for now.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 51, "closed_at": "1603186664", "comments": 9, "commits": 12, "created_at": "1599326481", "deletions": 586, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-pending", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 31369, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Remove legacy dqm", "updated_at": "1603186665", "user": "jfernan2"}

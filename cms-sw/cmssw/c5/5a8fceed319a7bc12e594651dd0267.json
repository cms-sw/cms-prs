This gets rid of the last such module under L1.\r\n\r\nTestBxOrConfig is deleted because it is a legacy version of the test module DumpL1RPCBxOrConfig, which is already a ```global``` type module and does everything it can do and more. It's also already not compiled and compilation has been broken since at least January 2023.\r\n\r\nI also deleted a test configuration that does nothing more than run the deleted module. And I also deleted some unnecessary includes that were already commented out (one of which included the legacy header).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nNone. Just deletions of unused code.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1706732400", "deletions": 141, "labels": ["l1-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "number": 43832, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Delete last L1 legacy type module", "updated_at": "1706787907", "user": "wddgit"}

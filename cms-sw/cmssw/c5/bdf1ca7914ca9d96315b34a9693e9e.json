The main interface\nchange is to require a StreamID or LuminosityBlockIndex\nargument to the getEngine function. In most cases,\nthis required moving code from the constructor to\nthe event or beginLuminosityBlock method. Then a pointer\nto the engine was percolated or passed in some way\nto the point where it was used.\n\nIn some cases, I added declarations of shared resources\nwhere it was obvious they were needed, but I did not\nthoroughly check for and declare all shared resources\nthat will eventually be needed.\n\nNote that this was done in two parts. The first pull\nrequest was already merged into 7_0_X some time ago.\nIt took care of Pythia 8 and ExternalDecays. The\nrest of the generators are taken care of in this pull\nrequest.\n\nNote that the content of this pull request is almost\nidentical to pull requests 1982 and 2150. Pull request\n1982 was signed by all L2's. The only differences are\nrelated to resolving conflicts that occurred when\nunrelated development was merged in. It was also rebased\ntwice.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "changed_files": 100, "closed_at": "1391522953", "comments": 6, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1391451600", "deletions": 538, "labels": ["core-approved", "fully-signed", "generators-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "d1eaa9a8b1563f654ab70bceea39f6824b110094", "merged_at": "1391522953", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_1_0_pre5", "number": 2282, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Migrate Generators to New Random Service Interface", "updated_at": "1396880348", "user": "wddgit"}

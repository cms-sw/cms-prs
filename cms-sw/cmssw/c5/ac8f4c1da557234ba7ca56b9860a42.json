We now report if an input value would result in bad array reads.\r\nIn addition, moved the arrays from the stack to a compile time created memory location.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCompiles locally. Converted old array assignments into static_assert to check that array order was properly preserved. Obtained array values mechanically via command line pipes of `grep`, `awk`, `head` and `tail`.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1554027718", "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1553462943", "deletions": 428, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "6751a91aa71118d5d496512a332b5928fd0e950e", "merged_at": "1554027718", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 26241, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 4, "state": "closed", "title": "Protect against bad inputs in EnergyUncertaintyElectronSpecific", "updated_at": "1554027718", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

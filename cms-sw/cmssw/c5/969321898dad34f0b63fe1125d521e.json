This makes the test setup more accessible (since Docker typically requires superuser permission). An augmented Docker image with PyTorch libraries included is now hosted on DockerHub at https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/fastml/triton-torchgeo, while the Singularity version of that image is automatically generated and hosted on `/cvmfs/unpacked.cern.ch` thanks to https://gitlab.cern.ch/unpacked/sync.\r\n\r\nA unified script `triton` is introduced to handle the server for both the Docker and Singularity cases. It also handles using GPU instead of CPU, verbosity, waiting for the server to actually start, and other details. The documentation is updated accordingly.\r\n\r\n(This PR also fixes some alarmingly fast link rot in the tests... hopefully Nvidia is done renaming the triton inference server repository.)\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested on several different machines, and had some other users test as well.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1601643741", "comments": 14, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1601395250", "deletions": 35, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "heterogeneous-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "bdc06994f58aa203bf8f83dfd38a8a0f0aaf251e", "merged_at": "1601643741", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 31616, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "SonicTriton tests with Singularity", "updated_at": "1601643741", "user": "kpedro88"}

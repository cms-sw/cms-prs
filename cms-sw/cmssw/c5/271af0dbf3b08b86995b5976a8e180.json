However, output modules were recently modified to enforce the consumes interface.\nThis required a new NamedEventSelector constructor to enforce the consumes interface. However, the default event selector does not consume anything, so the prior constructor was needed just for it.\nChris Jones commented that this old constructor should be removed if no longer needed.\nThis PR removes the default selector, and replaces it with a simple bool wantAllEvents_ flag, thereby simplifying the code.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1458143224", "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1458073043", "deletions": 18, "labels": ["comparison-available", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "tests-rejected"], "merge_commit_sha": "0e19d0048806b01e4bf230edb8c63660c956279d", "merged_at": "1458143224", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 13735, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Remove unneeded selector", "updated_at": "1458163079", "user": "wmtan"}

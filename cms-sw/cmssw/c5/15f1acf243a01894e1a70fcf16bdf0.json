Thread efficiency looked good, MiniAOD job was pegged at ~200% for a 2 core test.\n\nOnce we are done examining the various changes I will squash the commits down to something less sprawling.\n\nI have now tested this incrementing the number of threads from 2 up to 8. Thread efficiency is good up until 6 threads and then it stabilizes, and the initialization time explodes rather quickly beyond 6 threads.\nConverting a new legacy module that appeared in 76X did increase the thread efficiency.\n\nBackports to 75X and 74X after we have some more thorough testing (validation and such) and the dust settles from the MiniAOD reprocessing campaign.\n\n@Dr15Jones\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 80, "closed_at": "1441947914", "comments": 121, "commits": 17, "created_at": "1438903601", "deletions": 1401, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-rejected", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "54a50e3507c7b5f9662d17872c63ceee8645ed1d", "merged_at": "1441947914", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 10620, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 36, "state": "closed", "title": "Convert all remaining MiniAOD modules to threaded FW (76X)", "updated_at": "1441947914", "user": "lgray"}

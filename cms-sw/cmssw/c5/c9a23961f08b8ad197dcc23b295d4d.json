It is possible to do this by requiring an additional bit that is exclusively PNet or DeepTau.\r\nIn the process of implementing the PNet bits, several non-functioning DeepTau bits were also updated, enabling more Tau triggers to be matched, specifically VBF SingleTau.\r\n\r\nThe changes were tested by re-emulating signal files from the HLT decision to NanoAOD, and then observing the filter bits at the NanoAOD level. \r\n\r\nThis PR does not depend on other PRs.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1712736886", "deletions": 33, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved", "xpog-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 44688, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Updated Tau Filterbits for 2024 Data Taking", "updated_at": "1712743726", "user": "brallmond"}

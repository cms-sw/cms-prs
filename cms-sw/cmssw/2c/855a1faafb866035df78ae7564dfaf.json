It was checked that the reduction of this volume is harmless for the positioning of tracker components\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nNot a backport\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1664963040", "comments": 9, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1664872161", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["geometry-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "upgrade-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "2f9cdcf69d1487ed8ae1aff2de6ee83a149ddbee", "merged_at": "1664963040", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_6_X", "number": 39592, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Phase 2 tracker: adding tracker T31 ", "updated_at": "1664963040", "user": "adewit"}

This fix calls the sourceCandidatePtr and checks isNonnull() and isAvailable() inside getJetConstituentsQuick() before passing the candidates to the return statement.  If the candidatePtr is bad, a warning is thrown and the candidate is not passed to return.  This allows for getJetConstituentsQuick() to run over miniAOD and not halt runtime.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "changed_files": 4137, "closed_at": "1422966250", "comments": 2, "commits": 4226, "created_at": "1422965639", "deletions": 751110, "labels": ["alca-pending", "analysis-pending", "comparison-pending", "core-pending", "db-pending", "generators-pending", "geometry-pending", "hlt-pending", "l1-pending", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-rejected", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "number": 7524, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Check for valid pointers in Jet Constituents", "updated_at": "1422966250", "user": "heilman"}

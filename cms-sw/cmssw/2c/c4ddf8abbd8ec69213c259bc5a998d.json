No idea why only some were done. This branch formally adds the consumes interface where it was missing. But BEWARE! I am no expert on this code, and there is what I consider to be a rather complicated templated class MinMETProducerT that you probably normally wouldn't want me messing with, and now I've given it a vector<EDGetTokenT<METCollection> >. The whole package compiles and builds in 710pre4. But it is in no way tested. I wouldn't have a clue how to do that.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "changed_files": 13, "closed_at": "1396118157", "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1395421477", "deletions": 50, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "88459df516e4a58db8bdf865922613c2ed2ebcc7", "merged_at": "1396118157", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_1_0_pre6", "number": 2960, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add consumes interface to METProducers", "updated_at": "1405070757", "user": "ptcox"}

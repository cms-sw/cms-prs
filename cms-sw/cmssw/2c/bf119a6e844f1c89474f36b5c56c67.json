I started with CMSSW_7_1_0_pre1; maybe that's why the comparison shows so many commits?\nThis change is to restore the hit residuals in relMon that were broken at CMSSW_6_2_0_pre8 as a side effect of the revised tracking particles. A branch in the code that was already in place for pixels is now executed for the strips as well. This branch doesn't depend on the (broken) crossing-frame pointers of the digiSimLinks.

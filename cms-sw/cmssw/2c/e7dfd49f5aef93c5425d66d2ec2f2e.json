A number of plots were not filled for HEP17 last year because it would have mixed QIE8 and QIE11 digis; QIE11-specific plots were created in QIE11Task. Now that HE==QIE11, I integrated the plots of interest from QIE11Task to DigiTask.\r\n\r\nI also included one small bug fix for LaserTask: with the 2018 HE, the range for the laser signal has to be increased.\r\n\r\n#22971 should be merged first. \r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_10_1_X", "changed_files": 16, "comments": 6, "commits": 16, "created_at": "1523861469", "deletions": 179, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_1_X", "number": 22972, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "HCALDQM: Update DigiTask for 2018 HE (10_1_X backport)", "updated_at": "1523904361", "user": "DryRun"}

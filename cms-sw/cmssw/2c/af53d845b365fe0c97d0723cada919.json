All of the track selection cuts in the TrackJet, TrackJetEmulation, and TrackFastJet producers are moved into the TrackSelection (TS)->TrackVertexAssociation (TVA)->TrackJet chain. This follows what is being done in emulation and allows users to change that track selection cuts in one single place instead of in 3 separate producers where inconsistencies can occur often.\r\n2. The track selection cuts are updated to new cuts that achieve higher jet efficiency, as can be seen [here](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1340389/contributions/5642800/attachments/2741793/4769440/GTT_trkjet_27_10_23.pdf) (slide 6). These new cuts were presented to and accepted by the GTT group.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI have checked that the performance before and after each step above (moving track selection out of the jer producers and changing the track cuts) works exactly as expected. I have also run the code checks and formatting.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 10, "closed_at": "1705677871", "comments": 12, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1703005170", "deletions": 376, "labels": ["l1-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "upgrade-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "6c9b3540091dc7bdb9bbcdfe788fa8e8a1aef820", "merged_at": "1705677871", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "number": 43610, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Update L1 track jet cuts", "updated_at": "1705677873", "user": "cgsavard"}

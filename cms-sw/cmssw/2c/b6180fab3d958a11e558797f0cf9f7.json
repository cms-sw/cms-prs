These engines are percolated in various ways\nto where they are used. Classes are modified to only\ngenerate random numbers in the event and beginLuminosityBlock\nmethods.\n\nFor Pythia8GeneratorFilter this required changes to\nPythia8Hadronizer and also the EvtGen, Photos,\nand Tauola external decayers. Other generators\n(for example Pythia6) are not broken by these changes,\nbut have not been modified yet.\n\nHadronizerFilter and GeneratorFilter also declare\nshared resources.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 40, "closed_at": "1387093981", "comments": 6, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1386947902", "deletions": 251, "labels": ["core-approved", "fastsim-approved", "generators-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "0ce27e0949ef1e901331adae8f0f028a98ea3289", "merged_at": "1387093981", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_0_0_pre11", "number": 1807, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "Multithreaded Random Number Service - Generators", "updated_at": "1392131546", "user": "wddgit"}

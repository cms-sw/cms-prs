It also corresponds to the same payloads used for the 2018 IOVs updated in PR #30984.  \r\n\r\nThe GT diffs are as follows:\r\n\r\n**2018 design**\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/111X_upgrade2018_design_v1/111X_upgrade2018_design_v2\r\n\r\n**2018 realistic**\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/111X_upgrade2018_realistic_v1/111X_upgrade2018_realistic_v2\r\n\r\n**2018 heavy ion**\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/110X_upgrade2018_realistic_HI_v5/111X_upgrade2018_realistic_HI_v1\r\n\r\n**2018 realistic (HEM15/16 failure)**\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/111X_upgrade2018_realistic_HEfail_v1/111X_upgrade2018_realistic_HEfail_v2\r\n\r\n**2018 cosmics (tracker deco mode)**\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/111X_upgrade2018cosmics_realistic_deco_v1/111X_upgrade2018cosmics_realistic_deco_v2\r\n\r\n**2018 cosmics (tracker peak mode)**\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/111X_upgrade2018cosmics_realistic_peak_v1/111X_upgrade2018cosmics_realistic_peak_v2\r\n\r\nFor the 2018 HI scenario, the obsolete, unlabeled `SiPixel2DTemplateDBObjectRcd` tag is removed.

The width parameters (emittance & sigmaZ) are taken from 2018 PbPb, which should be quite close to what we get this year, and are quite a bit different from the pp defaults. \r\n\r\nThis vertex smearing is not yet active in relval, as it needs the matching reco beamspot in the global tag.\r\n\r\n@francescobrivio @tvami \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1660086919", "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1660046771", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["operations-approved", "simulation-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "72f6cb015fb700badb6e134d199dd81351cb724b", "merged_at": "1660086919", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 39010, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Vertex smearing for 2022 PbPb based on pp centroid and 2018 PbPb width", "updated_at": "1660086919", "user": "mandrenguyen"}

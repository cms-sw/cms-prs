The width parameters (emittance & sigmaZ) are taken from 2018 PbPb, which should be quite close to what we get this year, and are quite a bit different from the pp defaults. \r\n\r\nThis vertex smearing is not yet active in relval, as it needs the matching reco beamspot in the global tag.\r\n\r\n@francescobrivio @tvami \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 4, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1660046771", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["simulation-pending", "operations-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 39010, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Vertex smearing for 2022 PbPb based on pp centroid and 2018 PbPb width", "updated_at": "1660047266", "user": "mandrenguyen"}

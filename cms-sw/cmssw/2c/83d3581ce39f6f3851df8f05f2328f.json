After I added numerators and denominators to L1TObjectsTiming module, I made a new module for inserting ratio plots in the DQM/L1TMonitorClient directory L1TObjectsTimingClient_cff and I modified the L1TStage2MonitorClient_cff module in order to produce ratio plots.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 7, "comments": 9, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1520346039", "deletions": 16, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "dqm-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_1_X", "number": 22486, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 9, "state": "open", "title": "Ratio Timing Plots for L1TObjects - L1T & Online DQM - CMSSW - 101X", "updated_at": "1520348977", "user": "dtsitson"}

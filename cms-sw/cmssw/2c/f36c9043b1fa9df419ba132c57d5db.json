There is a slight change in the beamspot z width but it does not invalidate the beamspot in the database.\r\n\r\nVertex profile in time (axis is ns, arb units):\r\n<img width=\"699\" alt=\"vertex_t_profile\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1068089/21045326/37de8d10-be00-11e6-8dba-edf952fbee9c.png\">\r\n\r\nVertex profile in z (axis in cm, normalized to ev/mm in 140 PU):\r\n<img width=\"699\" alt=\"vertex_z_profile\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1068089/21045328/37e06d4c-be00-11e6-91d4-714c1633b13e.png\">\r\n\r\nVertex shape in z and time (arb units):\r\n<img width=\"696\" alt=\"vertex_zt_profile\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1068089/21045327/37df9868-be00-11e6-9ed4-814c29553703.png\">\r\n\r\n@davidlange6 It would be good to get this in for the tracker TDR production, I also found a weird bug in the old HL-LHC beamspot such that x and z were correlated (which should not be the case!).\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1481528160", "comments": 46, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1481274894", "deletions": 248, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "0535d0caae1b238537e0fd480276b5473bf8f4a3", "merged_at": "1481528160", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "number": 16942, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "A correct description of the HL-LHC beamspot", "updated_at": "1481556005", "user": "lgray"}

I also reverted `Configuration/AlCa/python/autoCond.py` as requested by @davidlange6. Once this is merged, I can enable the automatic merge of 62X into SLHC.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "changed_files": 101, "closed_at": "1393159108", "comments": 5, "commits": 497, "created_at": "1392974012", "deletions": 1023, "labels": ["alca-pending", "analysis-approved", "core-pending", "dqm-pending", "generators-approved", "hlt-pending", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending", "visualization-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "3b4fa96387c2ec5c527e9e4d19f13671c0567107", "merged_at": "1393159108", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "number": 2576, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Merge latest, greatest `CMSSW_6_2_X` into `CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC` branch", "updated_at": "1393188702", "user": "ktf"}

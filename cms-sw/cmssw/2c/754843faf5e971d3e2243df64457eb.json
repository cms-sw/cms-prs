As a consequence, the standard reco b-tagging producers  end up being re-run even when that is not needed.\n\nIn some cases, such as the MiniAODv2 production in 74X, re-running of the standard reco b-tagging producers might be needed and for such cases the `loadStdRecoBTag` switch was added to `jetTools.py` that allows loading of the standard reco b-tagging producers.\n\nAll the code changes in this PR should be completely transparent and have no impact on the standard reconstruction.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 22, "closed_at": "1451508083", "comments": 13, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1451313267", "deletions": 190, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "cad37d8cc072b4c4796aadf91fa9592e15f73534", "merged_at": "1451508083", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 12848, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Improved loading of b-tag EventSetup in PAT", "updated_at": "1451515234", "user": "ferencek"}

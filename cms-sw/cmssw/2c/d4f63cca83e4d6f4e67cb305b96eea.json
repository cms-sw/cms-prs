In particular:\r\n\r\n- the previous python master definitions are restored;\r\n- the fillDescription of ```PrimaryVertexProducer``` is updated to provide a default, but no explicit cfi python at runtime;\r\n- conditional statements are introduced for the definition of ```TkClusParameters``` and ~~logical alternatives for ```TkFilterParameters```~~* in order to prevent the need for all possible versions always present in the PSet definition.\r\n\r\n```RecoHI/HiTracking``` code is neglected, as obsolete and anyway not properly working.\r\n\r\n*: as ```HITrackFilterForPVFinding``` is just an extension of ```TrackFilterForPVFinding``` and the output ```PSet``` has always the same name ```TkFilterParameters```, the use of logical statements for ```PSet``` like ```xor``` does not really works correctly. Using the extended version to provide the overall default seems the cleanest and safest solution.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nSeveral benchmark reco configurations are expanded and compared to previous version. FWK calidation of parameters is tested at runtime for a number of benchmark cases.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 19, "comments": 36, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1706879348", "deletions": 95, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "dqm-pending", "alca-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending", "tracking", "trk"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 43846, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 4, "state": "open", "title": "Primary vertex reconstruction: update configuration handling", "updated_at": "1707672495", "user": "fabiocos"}

In particular:\r\n\r\n- the previous python master definitions are restored;\r\n- the fillDescription of ```PrimaryVertexProducer``` is updated to provide a default, but no explicit cfi python at runtime;\r\n- conditional statements are introduced for the definition of ```TkClusParameters```` and logical alternatives for ```TkFilterParameters``` in roder to prevent the need for all possible versions always present in the PSet definition.\r\n\r\n```RecoHI/HiTracking``` code is neglected, as obsolete and anyway not properly working.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nSeveral benchmark reco configurations are expanded and compared to previous version. FWK calidation of parameters is tested at runtime for a number of benchmark cases.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 18, "comments": 5, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1706879348", "deletions": 91, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "dqm-pending", "alca-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-rejected", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "tracking", "trk"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "number": 43846, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Primary vertex reconstruction: update configuration handling", "updated_at": "1706890034", "user": "fabiocos"}

This will facilitate much wider usage of data scouting in CMS given the availability of the collections in all officially produced MC samples. I am not sure if this is the correct branch to merge into, but the change is very simple so I can prepare the PR in a different release without any problem\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe change was checked to correctly include the collections in the MINIAODSIM event content. In a small sample it was checked that this would increase the event size of MINIAOD by about 4%.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1630967729", "comments": 19, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1627577917", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["operations-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "xpog-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 34698, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "add scouting collections to MINIAODSIM Event Content", "updated_at": "1630967730", "user": "dsperka"}

Main new features are\n- implemented completely in python (it is also faster)\n- separate script for vertex plots, using the same infrastructure\n- the required DQM files are downloaded semi-automatically\n- allows to produce plots for a single validation campaign by running the script only once\n  - earlier one had to run the script many times toggling various variables back and forth to cover all samples\n- easier to maintain (both for new campaigns and new plots)\n\nI have been using the script for tracking validation since 72X, so this is mainly to get it integrated for easier use by others.\n\nShould not have any effect on standard workflows.\n\n@rovere @VinInn \n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 16, "closed_at": "1426854429", "comments": 12, "commits": 31, "created_at": "1426766671", "deletions": 8142, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "0fd4bfd01047d76bbe09b44cbe6cac7736de3b40", "merged_at": "1426854429", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 8408, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Rewrite tracking MC validation scripts", "updated_at": "1476956264", "user": "makortel"}

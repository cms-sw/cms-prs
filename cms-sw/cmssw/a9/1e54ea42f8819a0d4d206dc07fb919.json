Complying with the request from STEAM to limit the number of histograms produced, only signal paths are monitored, and not backup or control paths. So, these paths have been added to the monitoring:\r\n\r\n```\r\nHLT_HT170_L1SingleLLPJet_DisplacedDijet40_DisplacedTrack_v (CMSHLT-2280)\r\nHLT_HT320_L1SingleLLPJet_DisplacedDijet60_Inclusive_v (CMSHLT-2280)\r\nHLT_HT200_L1SingleLLPJet_DelayedJet40_SingleDelay1nsTrackless_v (CMSHLT-2280)\r\nHLT_HT200_L1SingleLLPJet_DelayedJet40_DoubleDelay0p5nsTrackless_v (CMSHLT-2280)\r\nHLT_HT200_L1SingleLLPJet_DisplacedDijet30_Inclusive1PtrkShortSig5_v (CMSHLT-2280)\r\n\r\nHLT_DiPhoton10Time1p4ns_v (CMSHLT-2280)\r\nHLT_DiPhoton10sminlt0p1_v (CMSHLT-2280)\r\n\r\nHLT_DoubleL3dTksMu16_10NoVtx_DxyMin0p01cm_v (CMSHLT-2301, CMSHLT-2326)\r\nHLT_DoubleL3Mu16_10NoVtx_DxyMin0p01cm_v (CMSHLT-2279)\r\nHLT_DoubleL2Mu10NoVtx_2Cha_VetoL3Mu0DxyMax1cm_v (CMSHLT-2279)\r\nHLT_DoubleL2Mu_L3Mu16NoVtx_VetoL3Mu0DxyMax0p1cm_v (CMSHLT-2361) \r\nHLT_DoubleL2Mu10NoVtx_2Cha_CosmicSeed_VetoL3Mu0DxyMax1cm_v (CMSHLT-2361)\r\n```\r\n\r\nand these paths have been removed (since they have been superseded by some paths above):\r\n```\r\nHLT_DoubleL3Mu10NoVtx_Displaced_v (CMSHLT-2279)\r\nHLT_DoubleL2Mu10NoVtx_2Cha_PromptL3Mu0Veto_v (CMSHLT-2279)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs a result, some histograms will be added, and a few will be removed.\r\n\r\n#39799:\r\n\r\nThis PR:\r\n1. removes the offline DQM monitoring of two obsolete HLT paths, which are no longer in the 2022 menu: `HLT_TrkMu16_DoubleTrkMu6NoFiltersNoVtx_v` and `HLT_TrkMu17_DoubleTrkMu8NoFiltersNoVtx_v`\r\n2. make it not required to have all paths be valid in the numerator and denominator, for the paths monitored in `MuonMonitor_cff`\r\n\r\nThe reason for the second part is because in the HLT 2022 v1.3 menu, one of the paths in the denominator was removed. As a result, the DQM plots did not get made, although they would have been fine, physics-wise. Changing this flag to false is the easiest way to have similar DQM plots with the earlier and later HLT menus, and it fixes this bug.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this PR, some DQM plots will be removed, and some will reappear.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nUsing the 11634.0 ttbar workflow, I have tested that the correct histograms are produced and filled in the harvested DQM file.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nBackport of #38848 and #39799 . This backport is needed so that the plots show up in the offline DQM GUI, which uses 12_4_X.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "changed_files": 11, "comments": 6, "commits": 10, "created_at": "1666277365", "deletions": 99, "labels": ["dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 39800, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "HLT release validation and offline DQM for EXO Run 3 HLT paths (12_4_X)", "updated_at": "1666710670", "user": "jalimena"}

It was checked that all newly added dependencies are actually required by the package with `git grep`.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 10, "closed_at": "1604933774", "comments": 27, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1604524508", "deletions": 16, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "generators-approved", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "7a400bca363da77f78e7359cf7cb8e1524a78012", "merged_at": "1604933774", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 32030, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "Clean BuildFiles in GeneratorInterface etc", "updated_at": "1604935369", "user": "guitargeek"}

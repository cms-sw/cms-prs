I therefore profit of this PR to change `BeamSpotOnlineProducer` in order to not consume it unless  `useTransientRecord` is set to `False`. This and declaring this parameter as optional in the `fillDescription` method of `BeamSpotOnlineProducer` allows to avoid declaring `hltScalersRawToDigi` as input collection.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nSuccessfully run:\r\n   * `runTheMatrix.py -l 20834.76`\r\n   * `addOnTests.py`\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

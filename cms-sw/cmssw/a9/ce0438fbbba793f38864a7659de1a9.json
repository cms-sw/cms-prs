In my test in 910pre3\r\n- in the release\r\n  * iterative tracking takes ~56 s/event\r\n  * pixel tracking + vertexing takes ~6 s/event (not included in above)\r\n- with this PR\r\n  * `firstStepPrimaryVertices` (part of initialStep) takes ~2 s/event\r\n\r\nI have not tested the timing of the sorting of `firstStepPrimaryVertices` from #19051 in the context of phase2 PU200, but I'd expect it to be small compared to the rest of the tracking.\r\n\r\nTested in 9_1_0_pre3 and 9_2_2. Expecting changes in phase2 as described above, and no changes in phase0/1.\r\n\r\n@rovere @VinInn @ebrondol ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 16, "closed_at": "1498044699", "comments": 19, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1497007754", "deletions": 67, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "965616cf8756871b932c89ab7bd1f23c3d071df9", "merged_at": "1498044699", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_2_X", "number": 19165, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Remove pixel tracking from phase2", "updated_at": "1498075281", "user": "makortel"}

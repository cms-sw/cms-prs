It fixes the NanoAODRNTupleOutputModule so that it is compatible with the new RNTuple API (most of which is stable now). It is successfully able to output RNTuple NanoAODs with a nicer organization than before, but the implementation is not finalized, as delayed flags are not implemented yet and field projections will probably be needed for backwards compatibility.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 14, "comments": 9, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1764871634", "deletions": 198, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved", "xpog-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_0_X", "number": 49551, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Fix NanoAODRNTupleOutputModule", "updated_at": "1765016735", "user": "ariostas"}

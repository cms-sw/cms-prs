It writes only one (or none) payload at execution and writes to an IOV corresponding to a lumisection not yet processed by HLT. It's achieved by using `OnlineDBOutputService::writeIOVForNextLumisection` instead of `PoolDBOutputService::writeMany`. The O2Os in duringFill now uses `OnlinePopCon` and `OnlinePopConAnalyzer` (implemented in #44927) instead of the original ones.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n- [ ] Get access to data needed by `OnlineDBOutputService` (oms-eventing.cms, run number and frontier key from cDAQ) outside of P5\r\n- [ ] Finish setting up `OnlineDBOutputService` in python configurations of the O2Os\r\n- [ ] Add unit test mode to python configurations of the O2Os to allow for testing without access to oms-eventing.cms etc.\r\n\r\nDepends on #44927 (has to be tested on top of it and merged after it)\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nWork in progress. Some tests were run but cannot be fully tested before resolving issues from the TODO list above\r\n\r\n#### Backport \r\nNot yet determined\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 11, "comments": 5, "commits": 12, "created_at": "1720373608", "deletions": 1356, "labels": ["db-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_2_X", "number": 45395, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "HLT-compatible LHCInfoPer* PopCon", "updated_at": "1727965611", "user": "JanChyczynski"}

Original description:\n\n> Based on the discussion in the HN thread https://hypernews.cern.ch/HyperNews/CMS/get/edmFramework/3597/1/2/1/1/1/1/1/1/1/1/1/1/1/1/1/1.html\n> I did the simplest (of the proposed alternatives) modification to `Eras.py` fulfilling our (TRK) need to run three tracking configurations with the phase1 detector.\n> \n> If this PR gets accepted, my plan for phase1 tracking era-migration is to do following two steps\n> 1. Migrate the existing phase1 tracking (Phase1PU70) to `trackingPhase1` era\n> 2. Update `trackingPhase1` era to the configuration in #13149, and move Phase1PU70-tracking to `trackingPhase1PU70` era\n\nCompared to #13266 the place of  `Run2_2017_tracking*` is changed to address the comment by @davidlange6 in Feb 17 RECO meeting.\n\nTested in CMSSW_8_0_X_2016-02-17-1100, no changes expected.\n\n@rovere @VinInn @davidlange6 \n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1456218044", "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1455786825", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["comparison-available", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "7c91d679853987cd238ddbd7283ce85630dbc6be", "merged_at": "1456218044", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 13383, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add eras to select tracking configuration for 2017 detector", "updated_at": "1476957140", "user": "makortel"}

This makes `TrackerTraits::layerStart` obsolete;\r\n- moving the pixel pitch from `CommonParams` to `DetParams` since, with T33, 3D sensors have a different pitch (tiny difference, but still);\r\n\r\nIt's a first piece of a wider effort to allow more flexible the detector geometry that can be used by the pixel CA. \r\n\r\nNote: the `layerStart` array in `Geometry/CommonTopologies/interface/SimplePixelTopology.h` could be dropped but at the moment is needed by the *old* CUDA modules.\r\n\r\nThis solves https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/45177 and allows to run Alpaka pixel tracks on D110.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRunning `29634.402`", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 53, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1720609148", "deletions": 30, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "geometry-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "hold", "tests-started", "requires-external", "code-checks-pending", "heterogeneous-pending", "trk"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 45421, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "open", "title": "Alpaka Pixel: Reading `layerStart` at Runtime and Variable `thePitch*` ", "updated_at": "1722866303", "user": "AdrianoDee"}

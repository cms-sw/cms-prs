This failed to cover one use case of TSG: running locally an extended version of the HLT tests which requires access to EDM files not used in IBs of any release cycles. Since these files are not used in IBs, they might eventually be removed from the IB-EOS cache, causing said local tests to fail if the EDM files are not available at any other T2/T3.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a unit test which accesses each of the EDM files needed for (the extended version of the) HLT tests. In practise, this serves as a trick to ensure that the cmsbot keeps these files cached in the IB-EOS area. The list of relevant EDM files is maintained in a text file, which can be updated by locally executing a script (the unit test does not modify the text file with the list of EDM files, it only uses it). A readme with further details is added under `test/`.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe new unit test passes.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

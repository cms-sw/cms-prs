The issue was caused by rounding differences between float and doubles. Namely that the value of kappa when on the edge of its allowed range as a float (0.01f) was less than the double value (0.01) used to check for errors. This fix simply adds a small amount to Kappa if it is exactly on the edge. \r\n\r\nTested by following the procedure outlined [here](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/29251#issuecomment-607706773) and checking that this does indeed fix the error.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1587019288", "comments": 31, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1586198796", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "db-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "32d4a1e9576a12a480b31876786a215617ee4386", "merged_at": "1587019288", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 29399, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "vavilov parameters kappa fix", "updated_at": "1587019288", "user": "OzAmram"}

Even though it compiled nicely, the fix introduced some pythia8 initialization problems, probably due to name changes of functions in GeneratorInterface/Core, I think.\n\nTherefore I made this new fix where I revert Pythia8Hadronizer.cc back to the former version and only updated the sections which deal with the weights. So this is a more minimal fix, as was actually suggested by Josh before. I have tested it with our generator fragments, and it is really working this time.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_4_2_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1404243011", "comments": 7, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1403013616", "deletions": 201, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "fully-signed", "generators-approved", "orp-pending", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "9552eaaa784c2c92eb3c94775fc6520532bb075e", "merged_at": "1404243011", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_4_2_X", "number": 4296, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Pythia8 interface fix which is really working this time", "updated_at": "1404243011", "user": "UAEDF-tomc"}

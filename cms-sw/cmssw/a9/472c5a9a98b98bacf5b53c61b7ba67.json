No change in physics output expected. The PFTau sequence can be somehow faster.\n\nThis change is already implemented in 71x and 72x, so in principle it is a backport. \n\nThe 71x request is #2843. There is no 72x request, as this one was included already in 71x pre-releases. It is not a full backport of that PR, but only the clean-up of quality cuts that is essential for the miniAOD tools development.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1405918425", "comments": 9, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1405512893", "deletions": 88, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "bd05d2f6f0ec4071951da25ba64ef20dcf673e30", "merged_at": "1405918425", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_0_X", "number": 4672, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Simplification of the tau quality cuts", "updated_at": "1407326140", "user": "jpavel"}

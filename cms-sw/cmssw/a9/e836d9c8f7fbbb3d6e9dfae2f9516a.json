These new types were introduced in #42634 (L1T-ZDC emulation).\r\n\r\nTwo types, `trigger::TriggerL1ZDC{P,M}`, are added to `TriggerTypeDefs.h`, and support for them is added to the plugin `HLTL1TSeed` (which puts L1T objects into the `edm::Event` as part of the `TriggerFilterObjectWithRefs` data format).\r\n\r\nA similar update was done in #36951 to support the L1T data formats for \"MuonShowers\". One difference in this PR is that the underlying data format, i.e. `l1t::EtSum`, is not a new one (unlike `l1t::MuonShower` was), and this makes the changes on the HLT side less extensive compared to #36951.\r\n\r\nNote: the `edm::InputTag` added to `HLTL1TSeed` in this PR will point to a non-existing collection in the current HLT menus until an unpacker for the ZDC inputs to the L1T-uGT is added to CMSSW (see https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/42634#issuecomment-1698132805). For this reason, only a `LogDebug` message is issued when this collection is missing, and eventually this should be replaced by a `edm::LogWarning` (once the unpacker is available). \r\n\r\nNo changes expected.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n`addOnTests.py` passed.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

We are preping to use this feature online late next week (basically as soon as we are convinced the alignment is good enough to be able to use it). As such, could we back port this PR to a 92X release. \r\n\r\nThanks and sorry for any hassle this causes.\r\nSam\r\n\r\n@Martin-Grunewald as you may not see it as its RECO code but used exclusively in the HLT (for now, the plan is to use it reco eventually)\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_9_2_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1500443189", "comments": 15, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1500021770", "deletions": 93, "labels": ["backport", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "691f1ae7df8e93ef986b7779c356192890ab752b", "merged_at": "1500443189", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_2_X", "number": 19742, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "New Interface for E/gamma 2017 Pixel Matching : V2", "updated_at": "1500443189", "user": "Sam-Harper"}

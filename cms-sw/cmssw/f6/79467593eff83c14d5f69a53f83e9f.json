It has been introduced the possibility to check if the selection done on DetId bits and the one done using the TkTopology are the same. \n\nThis PR is an update of PR#12771 with the new WFs running.\n@boudoul @delaere @venturia\n", "branch": "CMSSW_6_2_SLHCDEV_X", "changed_files": 23, "closed_at": "1452964812", "comments": 19, "commits": 20, "created_at": "1452607147", "deletions": 3502, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-pending", "dqm-pending", "geometry-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-rejected"], "merge_commit_sha": "124be5d326a0e9e22628bd72227ce3da7d949160", "merged_at": "1452964812", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_6_2_SLHCDEV_X", "number": 12918, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fixing tracking in SLHCDEV release", "updated_at": "1452964813", "user": "ebrondol"}

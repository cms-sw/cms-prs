The exact change was to remove empty string labels from their trigger plots: https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/commit/31aa4b69057f2484150dcdb052446ebda67b39d6#diff-3cfdfb75470274b0bba01135411f7f84f8bbe01dfbefef1f011423780860f578\r\n\r\nWe tried something similar and removed multiple empty string labels from an ECAL DQM timing plot, fixing the issue. The offending line was:\r\nhttps://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/DQM/EcalMonitorTasks/python/TimingTask_cfi.py#L22\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe two failing relvals, 137.1 and 136.8861 were rerun to find no errors and the expected output.\r\n\r\nrunTheMatrix.py -i all -l 137.8,136.8861 --ibeos", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1606215669", "comments": 10, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1606176973", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "61c8414a5196cb4c88335742704520530bc96fea", "merged_at": "1606215669", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 32250, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Remove Duplicate Labels from ECAL DQM Timing Plot", "updated_at": "1606215669", "user": "alejands"}

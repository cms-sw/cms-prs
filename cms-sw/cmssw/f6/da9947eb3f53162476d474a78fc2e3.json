The MuonMCClassifier has been updated and few bugs have been fixed.\r\nThe tools can be used to assess the performance of Muon ID and have been employed for the Particle-Flow performance paper (PRF-14-001).\r\nThe new code was initially developed in that context (in 7_4_X) and extensively tested there.\r\nNow it has been ported to CMSSW_9_3_X and tested on MC events with \"RelVal\"-like content.\r\nAn example is provided, running on Phase2 events having the TrackingParticles in the event content:\r\n MuonAnalysis/MuonAssociators/test/MuonMCClassifier/testClassByHitsTP_cfg.py\r\n\r\nThis PR is relevant for performance studies (e.g. Phase2 Muon TDR) and in general for developments in the muon ID validation.\r\n\r\n@calabria \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 11, "closed_at": "1505195316", "comments": 27, "commits": 8, "created_at": "1501790618", "deletions": 150, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "1c3dfd5c826b2c6958be147d21429d4398fac5cb", "merged_at": "1505195316", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_4_X", "number": 20051, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "Updated muon mc classifier", "updated_at": "1505195316", "user": "abbiendi"}

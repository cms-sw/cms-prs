This was changed to be thread safe by collecting the messages per Stream in a thread safe map and then having the system clear those maps once the Stream has finished with an Event. Although this is a behavior change, the only way this feature was used in the past was to gather the messages per Event anyway.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 15, "closed_at": "1385388278", "comments": 11, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1385155556", "deletions": 191, "labels": ["core-approved", "dqm-pending", "hlt-approved", "pending-signatures", "tests-rejected"], "merge_commit_sha": "2749f4704e270d3a9784aa9eaec88bc9afd2d8b3", "merged_at": "1385388278", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_0_0_pre9", "number": 1566, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Made Log Error/Warning recording thread-safe", "updated_at": "1386877745", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

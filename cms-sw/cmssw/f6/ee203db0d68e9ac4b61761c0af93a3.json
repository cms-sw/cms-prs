This is done by using a parameter named refToPSet_ which takes a cms.string with the label of the top level PSet to which one wants to reference. The reference does not happen until we convert the python PSet into the C++ ParameterSet. At that time a copy to the reference is used to create the C++ ParameterSet.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1396259385", "comments": 17, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1396016355", "deletions": 14, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "b10cf6151253a5745435c4fbda9d5d339e7f94f4", "merged_at": "1396259385", "merged_by": "nclopezo", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_1_0_pre6", "number": 3072, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Added refToPSet_ ability in python PSet", "updated_at": "1396602325", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

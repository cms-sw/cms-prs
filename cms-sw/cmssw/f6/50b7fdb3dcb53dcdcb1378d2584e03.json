To fix this I've just put the correct mass range around the Z peak (namely from `HighMassMin` to `HighMassMax` defined [here](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/DQMOffline/Muon/python/diMuonHistograms_cfi.py#L22-L23)).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nI have checked that the above plots are filled as intended by running the `10842.0` Z->MuMu workflow on CMSSW_13_2_6. The Z peak was visible as expected.\r\n\r\nFYI @caruta \r\n\r\nP.S.

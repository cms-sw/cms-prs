Given that the JetCorrector was doing 'hidden' gets from the Event it meant any module using the `JetCorrector` was unable to make all the necessary `consumes` calls.\n\nThis implementation avoids the `consumes` problem by having a new `reco::JetCorrector` which is an Event product. Therefore the module which makes the `reco::JetCorrector` can do the needed gets from the Event and knows which `consumes` calls are needed. This also simplifies the use of `reco::JetCorrector` since users no longer have to pass a `edm::Event` and `edm::EventSetup` to the methods of the class.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_2_X", "changed_files": 24, "closed_at": "1410261345", "comments": 9, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1409678943", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "comparison-available", "new-package-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "f517cd02b0ad949c91a64dfa09abe948ebb96fbc", "merged_at": "1410261345", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_2_X", "number": 5141, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "JetCorrector in Event", "updated_at": "1410780302", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

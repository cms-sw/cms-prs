We can't make `FWCore/Utilities` to depend on `DataFormats/Provenance`, and moving a service base class to `DataFormats/Provenance` didn't feel good either. We will later move other abstract base classes from `FWCore/Utilities` to `FWCore/AbstractServices`.\r\n\r\nIn addition, to prepare for `HardwareResourcesDescription`, this PR replaces the `enum` for \"available accelerator types\" as string(s) for \"selected accelerators\", that is just what comes from `process.options.accelerators`.\r\n\r\nIn addition (mostly to just take advantage of the PR touching these packages), this PR adds `hasGpuNvidia()` member function to `ResourceInformation` that can be used (e.g. in `TensorFlow` or `PyTorch` packages) to check if the job should use NVIDIA GPUs in a way that does not directly depend on CUDA. The last commit then changes the code in `TensorFlow` to use this function.\r\n\r\nResolves https://github.com/cms-sw/framework-team/issues/1198\r\nResolves https://github.com/cms-sw/framework-team/issues/1200\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

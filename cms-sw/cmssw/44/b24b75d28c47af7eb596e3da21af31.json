This is especially true for D49 (i.e. T15) which is the one we keep validating, as the change in the clusterizer / digitizer affects everything.\r\n**caveat**: T17 and T20 are eligible for clean-up and soon to be removed.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nNone so far, draft PR pending validation.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nNot a backport, no backport needed.\r\ncc @emiglior @OzAmram @tvami @skinnari\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1600053413", "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1599623115", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "21bbc0bc77a5016a9b62492b932a509ab9cc5915", "merged_at": "1600053413", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 31402, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "update IT CPE conditions, post dual slope ToT activation (also for other T* geometries)", "updated_at": "1600053414", "user": "mmusich"}

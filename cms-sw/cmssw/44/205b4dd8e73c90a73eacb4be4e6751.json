Clang relies on correct extension to\nselect a language, but it cannot be done with header file. Same\nextension is used for ObjC/C/C++.\n\nThe first argument must not be none, but a patch to header file.\nAn additional option must be passed '-xc++' to tell Clang that\nit will be C++.\n\nIf the header file is passed as argument to libClang then the order of\narguments is important! Otherwise libClang will ignore flags like -xc++,\nand go for the default.\n\nThis behaviors are documented in Clang source code.\n\nBecause of this on Darwin C++ exception handling is disabled, there is\nnot need for in C front-end. Simply put you loose all default C++\nlanguage options.\n\nThis resolves majority of ERROR: messages from\ncondformats_serialization_generate.py\n\nA few a left, but are the same as in CLANG IBs. More people should join\nthe effort to clean it up. There is <10 such issues, I might fix them. For \nyet unknown reason their are not visible on standard CMSSW IB on Linux,\njust on CLANG.\n\nSigned-off-by: David Abdurachmanov David.Abdurachmanov@cern.ch\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_3_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1412322076", "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1412258869", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "389347d24a90133540db5c7fbe3052a9b98821eb", "merged_at": "1412322076", "merged_by": "nclopezo", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_3_X", "number": 5657, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "condformats_serialization_generate.py: fix libClang ussage", "updated_at": "1412322076", "user": "davidlt"}

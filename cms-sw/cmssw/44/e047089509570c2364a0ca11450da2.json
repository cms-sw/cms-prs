I also added some protection to the rapidity calculation, since in previous version was calculated for all particles in the event, even those with very small energy. In the process I add the option of debugging.  \n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1480315908", "comments": 29, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1474024081", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "generators-approved", "orp-pending", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "6daddfb3684abea84cc9f0efa504edfdbf2a8e44", "merged_at": "1480315908", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 15876, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "single particle filter, add needed features", "updated_at": "1505316472", "user": "alberto-sanchez"}

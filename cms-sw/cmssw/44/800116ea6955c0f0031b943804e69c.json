They produce nothing, but are still in MiniAOD and NanoAOD production sequence. Maybe it would be good to remove them to get rid of the overhead they provide?\r\n\r\nLocal matrix tests all pass.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nJonas", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 8, "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1538394149", "deletions": 424, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "code-checks-pending", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_3_X", "number": 24769, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Remove stub EGM regressor classes from production", "updated_at": "1538394190", "user": "guitargeek"}

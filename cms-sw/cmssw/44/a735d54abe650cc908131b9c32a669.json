The motivation and impact on the HBHE reconstruction are given in [presentation by Taeun Kwon](https://indico.cern.ch/event/936151/contributions/3933432/attachments/2070567/3476700/pedestal.pdf). A separate, currently unused field in `HcalSiPMParametersRcd` is used to implement these changes but the corresponding code changes have not been made. Therefore, at this point, no changes are expected in standard workflows.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the HCAL pedestal widths are updated for 2023 and 2024 scenarios, following [the request in the AlCaDB HN](https://hypernews.cern.ch/HyperNews/CMS/get/calibrations/4319/1/1/2/1.html).\r\n\r\nThe global tag diffs are as follows:\r\n\r\n**2021 design**\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/112X_mcRun3_2021_design_v5/112X_mcRun3_2021_design_v6\r\n\r\n**2021 realistic**\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/112X_mcRun3_2021_realistic_v5/112X_mcRun3_2021_realistic_v6\r\n\r\n**2021 cosmics**\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/112X_mcRun3_2021cosmics_realistic_deco_v5/112X_mcRun3_2021cosmics_realistic_deco_v6\r\n\r\n**2021 heavy ion**\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/112X_mcRun3_2021_realistic_HI_v6/112X_mcRun3_2021_realistic_HI_v7\r\n\r\n**2023 realistic**\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/112X_mcRun3_2023_realistic_v4/112X_mcRun3_2023_realistic_v6\r\n\r\n**2024 realistic**\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/112X_mcRun3_2024_realistic_v4/112X_mcRun3_2024_realistic_v6\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nSee the [AlCa HN thread](https://hypernews.cern.ch/HyperNews/CMS/get/calibrations/4319.html) and references therein for details.

These produced runtime errors like:\r\n```\r\n/data/cmsbld/jenkins/workspace/build-any-ib/w/tmp/BUILDROOT/e79955c4ee35855e71c28ad84fd140dd/opt/cmssw/slc7_amd64_gcc11/cms/cmssw/CMSSW_12_3_UBSAN_X_2022-02-11-1100/src/L1Trigger/L1TMuonBarrel/src/L1MuBMTrackFinder.cc:162:26: runtime error: member call on null pointer of type 'struct L1MuBMTFConfig'\r\n```\r\nfollowed by segmentation violations.  This PR replaces the thread-unsafe initialization and destruction of the static pointers with thread-safe manipulations of `std::shared_ptr`.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRan WF 139.002 in CMSSW_12_3_UBSAN_X_2022-02-11-1100 and verified that no null pointer derefs were seen and no new errors appeared.

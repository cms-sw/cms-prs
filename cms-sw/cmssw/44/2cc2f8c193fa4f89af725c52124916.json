See https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/59007#issuecomment-2474131218 for details. \r\n```\r\nThe specific issue should only occur with older glibc versions: the call to dn_expand [was removed](https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=commitdiff;h=75b3a15e077dbfdfd8cbb3449369379e700b9972) from getanswer_r in glibc 2.26. With version 2.34, dn_expand [has been moved](https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=commitdiff;h=640bbdf71c6f10ac26252ac67a22902e26657bd8) from libresolv.so to libc.so. However, I think we should still add a link to -lresolv, if only because that's where the functions are documented to sit. And my understanding is that it's a no-op on newer systems anyway.\r\n```\r\n\r\nlinking frontier_client library with`libresolv` does not fix the issue as looks like `libresolv` should be loaded directly by the application (e.g. `cmsRun`) and not via EdmPluginManager (dlopen)", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 13, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1748326133", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["core-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 48181, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[xSAN]Explicitly link against libresolv for Sanitizer IB", "updated_at": "1748419248", "user": "smuzaffar"}

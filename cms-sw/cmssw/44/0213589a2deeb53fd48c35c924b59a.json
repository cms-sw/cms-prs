In particular, most of the generators were changed from sources to producers three years ago, and the old source classes were removed almost three years ago (Nov 2012).   I am working on a generator feature that requires looking at a lot of config files that use generators, so it will make life easier if these obsolete config files that cannot possibly be used are removed from the release.  The few changes to files not removed in this PR are trivial, namely removing or fixing obsolete comments or message wording.\nThis PR removes over 5500 source lines from CMSSW!\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 94, "closed_at": "1436418111", "comments": 17, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1435878620", "deletions": 5506, "labels": ["alca-pending", "analysis-pending", "comparison-available", "core-approved", "dqm-approved", "fastsim-approved", "generators-pending", "geometry-approved", "l1-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "d9bcfc0f7015526a3e01c3cf74b28214b4ce244c", "merged_at": "1436418111", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 10030, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Remove uses of input sources that no longer exist.", "updated_at": "1436468651", "user": "wmtan"}

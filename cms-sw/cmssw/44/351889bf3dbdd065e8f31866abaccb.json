It could take a while before we have something that works, since the `ME0Motherboard` will likely be as complicated as the `CSCCathodeLCTProcessor` class.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time we have been running L1 simulations for the muon upgrade TDR on prompt muon and displaced muon triggers with so-called ME0 pseudo stubs. These are not actual `ME0TriggerDigi` objects, but rather `ME0Segments` produced from pseudo digis with a 2x coarser resolution than what is used in the offline. This is a reasonable emulation a future ME0 trigger. In this PR I put in place configuration fragments in order to produce such pseudo stubs. It is placed in the `ME0Trigger` package for now. \r\n\r\n@kpedro88 @tahuang1991 @nickmccoll ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": "1498550143", "comments": 40, "commits": 9, "created_at": "1498056762", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["comparison-available", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "f63a7346408930280fc6c01f0809b24df972f5c5", "merged_at": "1498550143", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_3_X", "number": 19399, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 5, "state": "closed", "title": "Configuration to produce ME0 pseudo stubs for Phase-2", "updated_at": "1498552826", "user": "dildick"}

However, for the unit test, we can pick the fake alignment instead.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nTest with `testTrackerHierarchy_cfg.py` and `testTracker_cfg.py`, they now run fine.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\nNot a backport.

In 2018, both parameters were changed thus it is important to track them in a correlated manner. For more details see the presentation in [Proton POG meting on 22 Sep](https://indico.cern.ch/event/957567/contributions/4025681/attachments/2106851/3543363/kaspar_xangle_apertures.pdf).\r\n\r\nIn particular:\r\n  * Validation/CTPPS/plugins/CTPPSLHCInfoPlotter.cc has now the 2D plot (extraction from data)\r\n  * CalibPPS/ESProducers/plugins/CTPPSLHCInfoRandomXangleESSource.cc generates both xangle and beta*\r\n  * in \"direct\" simulation: by default, the 2D histograms are taken from the external repository, cf. https://github.com/cms-data/CalibPPS-ESProducers/pull/4\r\n  * Validation/CTPPS/python/simu_config/: the configuration of the \"direct\" simulation by default uses the new 2D histograms\r\n\r\nThis PR depends on https://github.com/cms-data/CalibPPS-ESProducers/pull/4.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces no changes in reconstruction, thus no differences are expected in the matrix tests.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis PR has been tested with [these scripts](https://github.com/jan-kaspar/pps-quick-test/tree/11_2). The comparison of [reconstruction plots](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/files/5311726/reco_cmp.pdf) shows no difference. The comparison of [\"direct simulation\" plots](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/files/5311729/dirsim_cmp.pdf) shows:\r\n * no difference for 2016: where a single xangle/beta* value was used, thus switching to the use of distributions yields no change\r\n * updates for 2017 and 2018: where multiple xangle/beta* values were used.\r\n\r\nFurthermore the input (blue) and simulation-output (red dashed) distributions of xangle and beta* are compared in this [verification plot](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/files/5311731/verification.pdf) showing a good compatibility.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 13, "closed_at": "1602267285", "comments": 17, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1601546652", "deletions": 72, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "7a58544b5bf21f06e30582fd65309b86031c2606", "merged_at": "1602267285", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 31639, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "PPS: xangle-beta* distributions", "updated_at": "1602267285", "user": "jan-kaspar"}

The weights are already included in https://github.com/cms-data/RecoTracker-FinalTrackSelectors\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a pixelLess specific DNN with its tuned working points for mkFit workflows. The DNN is not loaded nor called by default as the pixelLess iteration now uses CKF tracking. \r\n\r\nNo changes are expected when testing the PR.\r\n\r\nThe PR can be useful for testing the impact of reintroducing the mkFit pixelLess iteration into the default tracking.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nthe improvements brought to the pixelLess DNN iteration in PU and no PU samples are described in this presentation\r\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/1213630/#3-dnn-tracking-classification\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1667240385", "comments": 20, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1666759791", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved", "tracking"], "merge_commit_sha": "ed1fb5f8d839181e1d3644e6ad55ef38d61b37b2", "merged_at": "1667240385", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_6_X", "number": 39854, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "mkfit pixelLess-specific DNN training", "updated_at": "1667240386", "user": "leonardogiannini"}

This was introduced a few weeks ago by @VinInn due to alleged performance improvements that turned out to be not as large when running larger scale tests. Given it is not supported on clang we (@VinInn and myself) agreed to drop it for the moment. Notice also that probably `-freciprocal-math` provides the same level of optimization and it is also available on clang.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_2_X", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": "1409627806", "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1409311965", "deletions": 21, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "c8d0a96509f22a8ef9645e3c39d7d2b000de7f0e", "merged_at": "1409627806", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_2_X", "number": 5107, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Drop -mrecip completely.", "updated_at": "1409627810", "user": "ktf"}

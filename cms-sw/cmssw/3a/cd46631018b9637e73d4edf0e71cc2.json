From that:\n\nTrajectorySeed has a move constructor (https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC/DataFormats/TrajectorySeed/interface/TrajectorySeed.h#L65) which previously wasn't used for the vector push.\n\nI haven't done any benchmarking, but each individual push_back should be quite small. At 140 pileup however pixelPairStepSeeds has O(100000) of these push_backs, and that's just one of the tracking steps.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1399574263", "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1399379698", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "70fa934eccffd6dcf0d0aae50c550437a2e3b815", "merged_at": "1399574263", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "number": 3695, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Use move semantics to push TrajectorySeeds into a vector", "updated_at": "1438586856", "user": "mark-grimes"}

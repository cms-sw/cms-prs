Also updated the framework to be able to treat BadChannels independently for each type of subdetectors. For Inner Pixel detectors BadChannel implementation is done in PixelDigitizerAlgorithm. 3D-Pixel and Bricked-Pixel algorithms inherit from PixelDigitizerAlgorithm. Also changed the variable/method names dead->bad as the name Bad signifies both dead and noisy\r\n\r\n###  Changes expected \r\n  - Less Digis in PSS and SS detector and accordingly lower Occupancy. The amount what  of loss depend on the fraction of bad channels introduced through the SiPhase2OTFakeBadStripsESSource \r\n  \r\n### Depends on the PR #37463 (already integrated)\r\n\r\n### PR validation:\r\n\r\nValidation is done using \r\n\r\nrunTheMatrix.py --what upgrade -ne -l 35010.0\r\n\r\nThe description and the plots are attached below\r\n\r\n@emiglior @mmusich \r\n[Phase2Digitizer_BadChannelStudy_15042022.pdf](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/files/8494633/Phase2Digitizer_BadChannelStudy_15042022.pdf)\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 13, "comments": 4, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1650000792", "deletions": 110, "labels": ["simulation-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-rejected", "orp-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 37576, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Phase2 digitizer updated to exclude  badchannel in Strip like detectors", "updated_at": "1650022681", "user": "suchandradutta"}

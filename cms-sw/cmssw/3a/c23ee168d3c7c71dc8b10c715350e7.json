However, hits with this flag set are included in offline reconstruction, so if something is wrong with the rechit energies, DQM should not artificially mask the problem. With this PR we modify the mask.\r\n\r\nIn addition, there are a few minor changes to plot descriptions to stay consistent with some minor changes to DQMGUI descriptions that will be included in the next PR.\r\n\r\nLink to 90X PR: https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/18467", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1493195139", "comments": 8, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1493157621", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "00fbb35c9b981781a92b96d3d1c2a1d44395d4bc", "merged_at": "1493195139", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_1_X", "number": 18468, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Removing kPoorCalib filter from energy plots", "updated_at": "1504092184", "user": "tanmaymudholkar"}

The content that was in\nDTCompactMapPluginHandler was moved into the fullMap\nfunction of DTReadoutMapping. The content that was in\nDTConfigHandler was moved into the new class\nDTKeyedConfigCache. The two modules that used it now\nhave that as a data member instead of accessing the\nfunctionality through a singleton. In both cases,\nthe algorithmic code was simply copied to the new\nlocation with minimal changes.\n\nNote the way DTConfigHandler used KeyList with a const_cast\nwas a problem and remains a problem. I did not fix that\nproblem. I just noticed it and copied that code from one\nplace to another. This will probably need to be fixed\nat some point in the future.\n\nRemove an optimization that was not needed from\nDTReadOutMapping that was added in a very recent\ncommit by me. Recently I added the atomicCache_ and\ncache_ data members and only the atomicCache_ is\nreally needed so I removed cache_ to simplify the code.\n\nRemoved two lines of code that did nothing and some\nfunctions that were never called by anything.\nAnd I renamed a local variable from theCache to\nlocalCache for clarity.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "changed_files": 21, "closed_at": "1397495053", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1397062128", "deletions": 834, "labels": ["alca-approved", "comparison-available", "l1-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "38eb4ac2d2a7fc81db1ce5134e20a82cc6d58aa4", "merged_at": "1397495053", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_1_0_pre7", "number": 3265, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Thread safety improvements in DT EventSetup formats", "updated_at": "1399558085", "user": "wddgit"}

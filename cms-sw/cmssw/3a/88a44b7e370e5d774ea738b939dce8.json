(Sorry for opening a new thread for this PR).\n\nThe update wrt the last PR are:\n-Migration of the EDAnalyzer to DQMEDAnalyzer as sugested by deguio and Dan in the Twiki. Is possible to test it?? I have tested the code with whiterabbit.py and all the test seem OK, but I dont know if this is enough.\n- Unfortunatly I did not migrate the DQMEDHarvester, but I am not sure if I have to do this for the DQM/Physics/src/ExoticaDQM.h and .cc .  \n\n-Then, a considerable reduction of the total number of histograms. Before I had histograms for all the Exotica High Priority Analysis: dijet dilepton and diphoton repated twice for the leading and subleading object and now they are merged into one.\n\n-Information about triggers is also added. This will be fully implemented once the triggers are more defined, but in the current version I only require triggered events.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_3_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1414407493", "comments": 13, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1413558662", "deletions": 625, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "c77f8bb8468fe9a1a6f013e18a522da1ff54f16a", "merged_at": "1414407493", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_3_X", "number": 5883, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "Exotica dqm update and migration thread safe", "updated_at": "1414409061", "user": "aescalante"}

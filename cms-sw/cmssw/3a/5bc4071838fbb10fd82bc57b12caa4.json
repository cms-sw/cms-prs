Tracks from these collections are matched against \"conversion TrackingParticles\", i.e. electron/positron TrackingParticles (`abs(pdgId) == 11`) that have photon TrackingParticles as their parents (similar to  `PhotonValidator` and `PhotonMCTruthFinder`). A consequence is that a track that is matched to a non-conversion TrackingParticle is classified as a fake.\n\nPlot script will be updated separately (to not to conflict with #12893).\n\nOn the same go I modified the seeding+building MTV instances (introduced in #12747) to be harvested only in the tracingOnly mode (where they are present) to silence printouts\n\n```\n%MSG-e DQMGenericClient:  DQMGenericClient:postProcessorTrack@endJob  11-Jan-2016 15:49:48 CET PostEndRun\n DQMGenericClient::findAllSubdirectories ==> Missing folder Tracking/TrackSeeding !!!\n%MSG\n%MSG-e DQMGenericClient:  DQMGenericClient:postProcessorTrack@endJob  11-Jan-2016 15:49:48 CET PostEndRun\n DQMGenericClient::findAllSubdirectories ==> Missing folder Tracking/TrackBuilding !!!\n%MSG\n```\n\nTested in CMSSW_8_0_X_2016-01-11-1100, no changes expected in existing plots.\n\n@rovere @VinInn @slava77 @matteosan1 \n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1452956144", "comments": 14, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1452590252", "deletions": 10, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "59b791152359da467ef89f553c1959f95d73d626", "merged_at": "1452956144", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 12909, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Monitor conversion tracks in tracking validation", "updated_at": "1476957077", "user": "makortel"}

This PR finally removes the option to run on single pads (which was the normal way since CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC).\r\n* Second major part of the pull request is a working version of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/31401, with the intent of making the CSC trigger configuration easier to understand. All psets for ALCT, CLCT, TMB, MPC and CCLUT are put in `python/params` rather than directly in `cscTriggerPrimitiveDigis_cfi`, reducing the main configuration to less than 100 lines. Thus `params/` contains\r\n```\r\npython/params/\r\n* alctParams_cfi\r\n* clctParams_cfi\r\n* tmbParams_cfi\r\n* auxiliaryParams_cfi\r\n* cclutParams_cfi\r\n* __init__.py\r\n```\r\n* `SLHC` was renamed to `Phase2` everwhere\r\n* `alctClctOffset_` was made a constant, defined in CSCConstants.h\r\n* `use_run3_patterns_` and `use_comparator_codes_` were merged into `runCCLUT_` (because we will not run the Run-3 patterns without CCLUT)\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested with 23234.0.

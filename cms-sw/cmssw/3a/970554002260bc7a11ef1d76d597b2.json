Do this so that the labels are not hard coded, but taken from the configuration files.\n2) Fix heavy ion specific configurations to use the correct labels.\n3) Fix one other config file ( SimMuon/GEMDigitizer/python/customizeGEMDigi.py) to properly handle backward compatibility.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 10, "closed_at": "1447231581", "comments": 14, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1446850157", "deletions": 43, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-available", "generators-approved", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "109f8ce78e3d46dafee2e8db595b36a19b35b19c", "merged_at": "1447231581", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 12303, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix heavy ion relval tests", "updated_at": "1447691943", "user": "wmtan"}

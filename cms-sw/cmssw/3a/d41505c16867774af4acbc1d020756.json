Note that the era does not enable mitigation for\n- HLT\n- for conversions (see also discussion in #15194)\n\nI also added a new matrix workflow (1325.4) to use the new era (`Run2_2016_HIPM`).\n\nTested in CMSSW_8_1_X_2016-08-22-1100. No changes expected wrt. #15464. For changes wrt. IB, see #15464. In comparison of 1325.4 in PR vs. 1325.0 in IB, differences in HLT and conversions are expected.\n\n@rovere @VinInn \n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 22, "closed_at": "1472712769", "comments": 31, "commits": 8, "created_at": "1472042631", "deletions": 73, "labels": ["comparison-available", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-rejected"], "merge_commit_sha": "d629c7d9af768556ace031d75809a00e1c831228", "merged_at": "1472712769", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 15590, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 9, "state": "closed", "title": "No vfp30 mitigation in Tracking (including customization with era)", "updated_at": "1472722299", "user": "makortel"}

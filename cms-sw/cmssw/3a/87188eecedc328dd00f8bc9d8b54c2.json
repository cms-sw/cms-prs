If the two files were not identical, fillDescriptions was changed to call `addDefault` which contains the old auto-generated values and a `add` call which uses the values from the _cfi.py file. In this way, a call to `import` will get the same values as were given before this change.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles. The unit tests for the checked-out code all passed (except one which failed to find its input file via an xrootd read from FNAL).", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": "1718111807", "comments": 24, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1717090748", "deletions": 82, "labels": ["core-approved", "geometry-approved", "l1-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "fdc0264ea5207400636ea1a5db23f275d9c3cb9e", "merged_at": "1718111807", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 45112, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "Removed _cfi.py which were duplicate of auto-generated ones", "updated_at": "1718111808", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

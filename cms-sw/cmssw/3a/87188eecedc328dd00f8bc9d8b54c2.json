If the two files were not identical, fillDescriptions was changed to call `addDefault` which contains the old auto-generated values and a `add` call which uses the values from the _cfi.py file. In this way, a call to `import` will get the same values as were given before this change.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles. The unit tests for the checked-out code all passed (except one which failed to find its input file via an xrootd read from FNAL).", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 7, "comments": 13, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1717090748", "deletions": 82, "labels": ["l1-pending", "core-pending", "geometry-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-rejected", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 45112, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Removed _cfi.py which were duplicate of auto-generated ones", "updated_at": "1717160171", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

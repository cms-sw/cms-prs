If it is, then the columnEfficiency remains unchanged, i.e. no dynamic inefficiency is used. \n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_2_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1406002396", "comments": 16, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1405085187", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_2_X", "number": 4624, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "Upgrade of dyn. ineff. feature to handle cases when PU is 0", "updated_at": "1406002396", "user": "ahazi137"}

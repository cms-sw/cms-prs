With this, the TP implementation should agree with the HTR spec and clarifications from @jmmans.\n### LUT\n- Defined magic numbers (mainly bitmasks) in the compression LUTs, compress 2017 TPs properly\n- Resize compression LUTs once, not at every DetId\n- Add two MSB for fine-grain usage to the linearization LUTs\n- Fix linearizations LUTs\n### Geometry\n- Map TP tower at ieta 26, depth 7 to tower 27\n### TP Algo\n- Add 2016 HF FG fixes from 80X\n- Add a stubb algorithm for 2017 HE FG\n- Add proper saturation behavior to HF (according to HTR spec)\n- Proper accounting of overlap tower at ieta 16\n- Split 2017 HE TP algorithm from 2009 HE TP algo to handle fine-grain\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 15, "closed_at": "1474012405", "comments": 29, "commits": 24, "created_at": "1473084262", "deletions": 120, "labels": ["alca-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "a03ca88e7099d97a5bd8455c3f2fb1e2fcd09b28", "merged_at": "1474012405", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 15735, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 4, "state": "closed", "title": "Improved 2017 HCAL Trigger Primitives", "updated_at": "1505480569", "user": "matz-e"}

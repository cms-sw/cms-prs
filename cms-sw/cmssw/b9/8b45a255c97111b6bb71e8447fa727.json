Added also the protection against possible wrong configuration input. The original description still applies, however:\n\nHaving moved the tau payloads to the production database, tau sequence is switching input for all its MVA discriminators and at the same time removing the root files from the CMSSW. The former behaviour can be restored by\n1) re-including the root files\n2) adding the 2 lines below to the config python to swich the input\n\n```\nfrom RecoTauTag.Configuration.switchMVAtoDB_cfi import switchMVAtoDB\nprocess = switchMVAtoDB(process)\n```\n\nNo changes in tau performance expected as the input should be identical.\n\n@andrew314\n@veelken\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 23, "closed_at": "1419272478", "comments": 7, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1418760783", "deletions": 325, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "7474f3311c3cb96b9e87dc20d1dd2397c92492d4", "merged_at": "1419272478", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 6949, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Switching default tau MVA input to ConfDB (attempt 2)", "updated_at": "1419272478", "user": "jpavel"}

The reason is that it is not stored into the database and maintenance needs only to be signed off by the btag conveners.\n- The current implementation of BTagCalibrationReader assumes that there is only one measurementType for all jet-flavors, where, in the 50ns scale factors, we have \"mujets\" for B- and C-flavor and \"comb\" for UDSG. => Interface change.\n- In the analysis one needs to know min- and max-pt for a given jet-flavor, eta and discr value, in order to handle the uncertainty if it's out of bounds. A function for returning the pt-bounds is added, so that the user does not need to hardcode values for that.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 15, "closed_at": "1460321092", "comments": 14, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1447794511", "deletions": 169, "labels": ["alca-pending", "comparison-pending", "db-rejected", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-rejected", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 12469, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "BTagCalibrationReader: move to RecoBTag/PerformanceDB, interface updates.", "updated_at": "1460321286", "user": "HeinerTholen"}

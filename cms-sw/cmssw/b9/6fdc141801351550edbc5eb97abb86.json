This PR addresses several points:\n1) Introduce `run3_HB` Era to propagate a few necessary changes for the HB upgrade (scheduled for LS2)\n2) Chain Phase1 HCAL Eras, digitization, reco algorithms, and validation/DQM into Phase2\n3) Add option to apply respcorr of 0.5/1.2 to depth 1 (layer 0) when using hardcode conditions\n\nSome things are still skipped for the Phase2 HCAL (packing/unpacking, noise flagging) due to lack of hardware maps.\n\nA subsequent PR will remove `HcalUpgradeDataFrame` and related classes/code.\n\nThis PR will conflict with #16315; I would prefer to have that one merged first and then rebase this one.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 22, "closed_at": "1478198520", "comments": 86, "commits": 8, "created_at": "1477491332", "deletions": 97, "labels": ["alca-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "geometry-approved", "l1-pending", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "1ca2d42e1847ab32b0bcdd1e512ec1a2615dfadc", "merged_at": "1478198520", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 16365, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 6, "state": "closed", "title": "Use HCAL Phase1 digi/reco for Phase2", "updated_at": "1478198520", "user": "kpedro88"}

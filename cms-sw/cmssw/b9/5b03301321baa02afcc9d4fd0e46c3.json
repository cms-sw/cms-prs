We have done both and attached some slides showing our results. We will be presenting these slides at the Pixel Offline Meeting on Wed. Jan 23rd. \r\n[Slides here. ](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/files/2780837/Jan23.pdf)\r\n\r\nWe are still working on generating all the needed 2D templates for different data taking IOV's so we current expect that many of the automated tests will fail unless they run on a specific IOV's that we currently have templates for and use specific Global Tags. More IOV's will be continually added. \r\n\r\n@perrotta @slava77 @fabiocos @makortel @tvami @tsusa @OzAmram @cmantill @schuetzepaul @pmaksim1 ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "comments": 0, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1548112828", "deletions": 62, "labels": [], "number": 25727, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Turning On PixelCPECluster Repair", "updated_at": "1548112828", "user": "OzAmram"}

For the backport to 10_1_X, modifications were made to simEmtfDigis_cfi.py such that the default EMTF emulator config matched the 2017 performance, for purposes of MC production.  However, SectorProcessor.cc assumed that the default config was 2018, so when configuring via the firmware version from O2O, it made no changes to the config.  This results in mismatching data-emulator comparisons in the DQM:\r\n\r\nhttps://cmsweb.cern.ch/dqm/online/plotfairy/live/0/Global/Online/ALL/L1TEMU/L1TdeStage2EMTF/mismatchRatio?session=5KVPLG;v=1530307566529797579;w=532;h=400\r\n\r\nThis PR changes SectorProcessor.cc to configure the 2018-specific settings correctly.  I have tested the standard DQM sequence (l1tstage2emulator_dqm_sourceclient-live_cfg.py) directly on ZeroBias data from runs 318828 (before the EMTF O2O fix), 318872 (after the fix), and 318953, and the configuration via FW version behaves as expected.\r\n\r\nI'd like to get this tested in the DQM tag collector as soon as feasible.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nAndrew", "branch": "CMSSW_10_1_X", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 10, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1530357525", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["comparison-available", "l1-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_1_X", "number": 23727, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "EMTF emulator fix FW config for 2018 data", "updated_at": "1530636918", "user": "abrinke1"}

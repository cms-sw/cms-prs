Some reasons:\r\n* Broken since at least 2015 (no consumes, it would throw)\r\n* Not compiled currently (would fail compilation since January 2023 because it's legacy)\r\n* Last edited in 2006\r\n* Content looks useless ( bunch of asserts)\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nNone. Only deletes an unused file.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1706707722", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1706650039", "deletions": 53, "labels": ["simulation-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "695ed7856207edf9efdcd61781836d2d1ba8140d", "merged_at": "1706707722", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "number": 43817, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Delete last simulation legacy type module", "updated_at": "1706707723", "user": "wddgit"}

This change sets the LUT bits based on linearized ADC values and updates the LUT in HcaluLUTTPGCoder. The four bits are returned and used in HcalTriggerPrimitiveAlgo to pass to the HcalFinegrainBit compute function, where the LUT bits are used in conjunction with the TDC values in the fine grain bit algorithm. This both sets the group 0 LUT for online use, and bases the fine grain bit emulation on the LUTs used to set bits in hardware.  \r\n\r\nIn addition, the changes in HcalFinegrainBit.cc align the fine grain bit assignments with those in uHTR HB firmware version 2.5.0 and onward. Bit[0] is depth / amplitude based, bit[1] indicates a prompt cell, bit[2] indicates a slightly delayed cell, bit[3] indicates a very delayed cell, and bits[4] and [5] are reserved MIP bits. \r\n\r\nThe uHTR LUT bit 12-15 settings and use in the fine grain bit algorithm are detailed in Section 3.5 in the uHTR specifications DocDB: https://cms-docdb.cern.ch/cgi-bin/PublicDocDB/RetrieveFile?docid=12306&filename=LLPbits_uhtr_spec.pdf&version=22. \r\n\r\nThese edits were presented at the Joint HCAL Trigger - DQM Meeting (Oct 8): https://indico.cern.ch/event/1084544/contributions/4559682/attachments/2324975/3959974/uHTRgroup0LUT_8Oct.pdf \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nPassed runTheMatrix.py tests.

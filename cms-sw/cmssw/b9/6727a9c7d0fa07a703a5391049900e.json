It writes only one (or none) payload at execution and writes to an IOV corresponding to a lumisection not yet processed by HLT. It's achieved by using `OnlineDBOutputService::writeIOVForNextLumisection` instead of `PoolDBOutputService::writeMany`. The O2Os in duringFill now uses `OnlinePopCon` and `OnlinePopConAnalyzer` (implemented in #44927) instead of the original ones.\r\n\r\nDepends on the backport of #44927 which is https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/46571 (has to be tested on top of it and merged after it)\r\n\r\nThere is a plan to add better unit tests (not necessarily in this PR).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested by running the workflow in various states of LHC (stable beams, no stable beams etc.) for a few fills. Each time the logs procured and the uploaded payloads were examined.\r\nThe unit tests for the `duringFill` mode have been updated (although its extension is planned).\r\nExample commands for running the workflow:\r\n```\r\ncd CondTools/RunInfo/test/\r\ncmsRun ../python/LHCInfoPerLSPopConAnalyzer_cfg.py mode=duringFill destinationConnection=sqlite:test.db \\\r\nlastLumiFile='last_lumi.txt'  tag=perls_test_tag startTime='2022-06-26 15:43:20.000'\r\n\r\ncmsRun ../python/LHCInfoPerFillPopConAnalyzer_cfg.py mode=duringFill destinationConnection=sqlite:fill_during/test.db \\\r\nlastLumiFile='last_lumi.txt' tag=perfill_test_tag  startTime='2022-06-26 15:43:20.000'\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Backport \r\nBackport of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/45395\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "changed_files": 17, "comments": 10, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1730391538", "deletions": 1395, "labels": ["db-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "backport", "requires-external"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 46572, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[14_1] HLT-compatible LHCInfoPer* PopCon (duringFill mode)", "updated_at": "1730833450", "user": "JanChyczynski"}

This limited the area used for the clustering, losing whole layer clusters for no reason. It's fixed now using a boolean for each layer. The consequence is that some multiclusters will have more energy than before (and a couple more layer clusters will be built).", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1505813317", "comments": 21, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1505414302", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "be887529af01e390bad207eb18f8b73363ad7406", "merged_at": "1505813317", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_4_X", "number": 20521, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "correctly update boundary box preventing overwriting in case a hit ha", "updated_at": "1505882777", "user": "clelange"}

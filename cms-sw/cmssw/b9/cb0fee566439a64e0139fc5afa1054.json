At the moment only `Run2025B` and `Run2025C` are really functional, being the only eras for which some certification is available in https://cms-service-dqmdc.web.cern.ch/CAF/certification/.  Still the workflows are defined up to an hypothetical era 2025I so that they are ready to be used for the RelVals.\r\n\r\nAlso, for the moment, I'd keep the 2024 wfs running the 2025 HLT key since we use them in release validation and I'd prefer to accumulate some eras before turning them back to the fake menu. The same applies to online/offline conditions: I'd keep around the 2024 data (F,G,H,I) wfs using the online ones.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 33, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1749552422", "deletions": 7, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 48281, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 8, "state": "open", "title": "Adding 2025 Data Wfs", "updated_at": "1750256334", "user": "AdrianoDee"}

At the moment only `Run2025B` and `Run2025C` are defined, being the only eras for which some certification is available in https://cms-service-dqmdc.web.cern.ch/CAF/certification/.  \r\n\r\nAlso, for the moment, I'd keep the 2024 wfs running the 2025 HLT key since we use them in release validation and I'd prefer to accumulate some eras before turning them back to the fake menu. The same applies to online/offline conditions: I'd keep around the 2024 data (F,G,H,I) wfs using the online ones.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1749552422", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 48281, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Adding 2025 Data Wfs", "updated_at": "1749552577", "user": "AdrianoDee"}

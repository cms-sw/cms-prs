Before this was done looking at the number of SimClusters associated, but this method was not fully correct: in the specific case of the single photons, they always had 2 SimClusters because of pair production but not always was in the Tracker. \r\nAn exception is introduced for the electrons which most of the time undergo bremsstrahlung and therefore are always converting in the Tracker. \r\n\r\nIt would be great if this PR manage to get into 11_3_0.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n- Efficiency on single photons before the PR: \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5331004/113116551-d7578780-920d-11eb-81be-bf3d78189883.png)\r\n- Efficiency on single photons after the PR: \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5331004/113116646-ecccb180-920d-11eb-8f86-32f26c9cd370.png)\r\n\r\n@apsallid @lecriste @rovere @felicepantaleo ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1617508428", "comments": 15, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1617173447", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "c7abaf901cb2bbbf833027b70575529bd199cc1c", "merged_at": "1617508428", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 33309, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "[HGCAL] CaloParticleSelector selects non-converted CP", "updated_at": "1617508428", "user": "ebrondol"}

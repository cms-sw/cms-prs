In addition to the removals in that PR, the HGCal development geometries D57, D58, D59, D62 are migrated from T17 to T21, producing D68, D69, D70, D71. The muon geometry M5 is removed as no longer relevant (see discussion in #30512). D63 is removed as redundant with D68.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n* checked that runTheMatrix workflow numbers for existing workflows stayed the same\r\n* ran new workflows 31434.0,31834.0,32234.0,32634.0 successfully\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 37, "closed_at": "1602080861", "comments": 19, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1601913489", "deletions": 1342, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "operations-approved", "orp-approved", "pdmv-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "ee737c01371c003a8d778d66aec12531767128f1", "merged_at": "1602080861", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 31673, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "Removal of phase2 Tracker geometries T17, T19, T20 and migrations", "updated_at": "1602080861", "user": "kpedro88"}

These are meant to be run over the `SteamHLTMonitor` PD at Tier0 and used by the `PromptCalibProdSiPixelAliHLTHGC` PCL flavour.\r\nIn that PR the DQM monitoring the the two sets of tracks produced was not introduced, which makes it difficult to check the tracks used in input to the alignment procedure. \r\nThis PR adds the DQM monitoring for those tracks.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRun successfully the following command:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrunTheMatrix.py -l 1002.5 --ibeos\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich is a test workflow introduced at https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/46956 to test the `PromptCalibProdSiPixelAliHLTHGC` workflow.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

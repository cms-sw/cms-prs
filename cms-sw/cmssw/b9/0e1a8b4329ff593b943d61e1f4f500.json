They will be installed beginning of November 21. Private validation on lab data, Run2 data and full simulation was done.  \r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nNo backport expected.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": "1630729508", "comments": 19, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1630305883", "deletions": 19, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "f18a472f359d8349c645a083aeb38711d89d84c8", "merged_at": "1630729508", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "number": 35067, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "PPS Pixel data unpacking", "updated_at": "1630729508", "user": "fabferro"}

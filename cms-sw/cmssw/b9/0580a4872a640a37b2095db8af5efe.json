A small reduction in the ETL occupancy is observed due to the TDC window emulation.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1762961696", "comments": 20, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1762800190", "deletions": 26, "labels": ["dqm-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "28ab87513f6f3eea95138959dd1ea8dbaa852be5", "merged_at": "1762961696", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_16_0_X", "number": 49361, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "MTD digitization: update ETL digitization to emulate ETROC TDC window ", "updated_at": "1762961697", "user": "martinamalberti"}

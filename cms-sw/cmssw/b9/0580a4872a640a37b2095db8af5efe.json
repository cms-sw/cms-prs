A small reduction in the ETL occupancy is observed due to the TDC window emulation.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "comments": 13, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1762800190", "deletions": 26, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_0_X", "number": 49361, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "MTD digitization: update ETL digitization to emulate ETROC TDC window ", "updated_at": "1762929911", "user": "martinamalberti"}

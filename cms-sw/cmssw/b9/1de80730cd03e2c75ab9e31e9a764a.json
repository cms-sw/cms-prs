The total event size increases only a few per mille. I think these are small enough to declare #23624 solved, because it is better to focus work elsewhere for much larger size reductions.\r\n\r\nTested in 10_3_0_pre3, no changes expected (except for a hypothetical premixing workflow with D28 geometry to work). Fixes #23624.\r\n\r\n@kpedro88 @mdhildreth ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1537645616", "comments": 12, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1537450911", "deletions": 23, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "37e96dca36fc4c03aa224c8be1f8a7b15b82fdc7", "merged_at": "1537645616", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_3_X", "number": 24610, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix premixing for HGCal v9 geometry", "updated_at": "1537645616", "user": "makortel"}

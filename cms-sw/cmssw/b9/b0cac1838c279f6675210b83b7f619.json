This has been used in the ETL digitization, but it is a general functionality potentially valid fro BTL as well. While in BTL the crystals are correctly positioned at the center of pixels, and there is so far no use of inter-crystal gaps, this PR turns the check for ETL into a general method usable also for BTL if needed.\r\n\r\nIn order to do this, the ```mtdParameters.xml``` values are updated for BTL with values extracted from the ideal geometry, rounding at 1 micron level, and for y moving a residual 0.5 inter-crystal micron to the border gap.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTest wf 34634.0 runs.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1618905309", "comments": 15, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1618582858", "deletions": 13, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "orp-approved", "requires-external", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "0da9e232bc59f72683b6cbd5b7c0cbf6240b682d", "merged_at": "1618905309", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "number": 33453, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "MTD geometry and digitization: move check for pixel active area into RectangularMTDTopology, make it usable for BTL as well", "updated_at": "1618905310", "user": "fabiocos"}

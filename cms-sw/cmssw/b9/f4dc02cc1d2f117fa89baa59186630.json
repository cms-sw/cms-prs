Just to be sure, we still need to test it in official production that the issue is indeed fully solved.\r\nOutput of an example job:\r\nhttps://cmsweb.cern.ch/scheddmon/0197/cms1305/190523_121600:asaibel_crab_Generator_InitializeOnlyFirstLumi/job_out.3.0.txt\r\n\r\nBefore the changes, the jobs always failed after the change in luminosity block after 100events. You can see in the job that 350 events (two lumiBlock changes) are produced without failing.\r\n\r\nThe content of the PS weights was checked by checking the number of weights for each event in the GenEventInfoProduct\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1559023721", "comments": 17, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1558616629", "deletions": 333, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "generators-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "459b90391aae5b3ecd4666f1a4b6ef887ebc3475", "merged_at": "1559023721", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 26905, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Herwig7 fix seg fault master", "updated_at": "1559023721", "user": "Andrej-CMS"}

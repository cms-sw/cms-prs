As the module does not run in central workflows, I simply tested that a few `runTheMatrix.py` get to completion after the fix.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1635315066", "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1635257574", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "e07029d1cf61ad4e6a16970c5693085f72ec11c2", "merged_at": "1635315066", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "number": 35851, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "[DQM] Fix DTChamberEfficiencyTest esConsumes to use proper Transition", "updated_at": "1635315067", "user": "battibass"}

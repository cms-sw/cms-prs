The uGT firmware requires at least 1 pair of OS muons for Quad Muons. The bug in the uGT emulator corresponded to a requirement of exactly 2 OS pairs of muons, which disagreed with firmware. This PR fixes that bug so that the emulator only requires at least 1 pair of OS muons for Quad Muons.\r\n\r\nNo changes in output are expected.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis PR has been validated by the following:\r\n(1) confirming that all code changes compile correctly using l1t-integration-CMSSW_11_2_0 with tag l1t-integration-v105.3\r\n(2) confirming that all code changes execute properly by producing test vectors\r\n(3) confirming that the bug-fix is correct by comparing the emulator results in the test vectors with the uGT firmware.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/cms-l1t-offline/cmssw/pull/894\r\n\r\n@rekovic @cavana \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1617792006", "comments": 9, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1617725756", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "65ff35159c3012831ed4d0a99741aea089bc8e46", "merged_at": "1617792005", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 33346, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "L1T Bugfix for Quad Muon OS condition", "updated_at": "1617792006", "user": "cecilecaillol"}

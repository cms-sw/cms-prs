Different producers could not load different models since the first instance determined the model used for all the other instances.\r\nThis PR resolves the issue by moving ONNXRuntime and ONNXSession as members of the `TracksterInference*` object. \r\n\r\nAlso adds a bug fix in the TICLv5 modifier to select the correct new model introduced in  #47550\r\n### backport \r\n\r\nAs it is bug fix, this PR should be backported to CMSSW_15_0_X\r\n\r\n@Moanwar", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": "1742534104", "comments": 32, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1742305417", "deletions": 34, "labels": ["hlt-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "bug-fix", "orp-approved", "upgrade-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "a63f36e75b3ba788cb073b5d561f1bbdbbc916aa", "merged_at": "1742534104", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 47616, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix TICL Energy Regression and PID Model Loading", "updated_at": "1742534106", "user": "waredjeb"}

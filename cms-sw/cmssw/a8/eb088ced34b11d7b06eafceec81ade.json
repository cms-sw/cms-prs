The latter applies not only to the PCL workflow, but also the offline MillePede workflow which is migrated the `edm::one::EDAnalyzer` version of the alignment producer.\r\nAs a bonus, the main part of the offline alignment code is now routinely exercised during integration tests.\r\n\r\nThis changes has also been presented at the [last Tracker Alignment meeting](https://indico.cern.ch/event/607510/contributions/2533635/attachments/1436040/2208307/Alignment-UnifiedAliProducer_CMS-TkAl_20170329.pdf).\r\n\r\nThis PR includes also some minor fixes regarding the transition to phase-1.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 41, "closed_at": "1493207027", "comments": 24, "commits": 24, "created_at": "1490945205", "deletions": 2951, "labels": ["alca-approved", "comparison-notrun", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "tests-rejected"], "merge_commit_sha": "76ed3994c6d2b497fe95ff272e9ee2ebb04cdbf9", "merged_at": "1493207027", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_1_X", "number": 18138, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "[91X] Unify alignment producers", "updated_at": "1493732942", "user": "ghellwig"}

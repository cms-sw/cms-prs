In previous PRs I introduced data formats for the CSC, EMTF and uGMT shower objects, and emulators for the CSC trigger, EMTF and uGMT.  A new object `MuonShower` object is introduced in the L1TGlobal emulator and data format packages. This object is treated separately from the regular `Muon` object. The core code is currently switched off, i.e. the parameter that enables reading muon shower trigger bits from the L1T menu XML file is set to `False`. As such, there should be no differences in any workflow. The code is based on UTM lib 0.9.X (https://gitlab.cern.ch/cms-l1t-utm/utm), which was recently integrated into CMSSW_12_0_X (https://github.com/cms-sw/cmsdist/pull/7337) and CMSSW_12_1_X (https://github.com/cms-sw/cmsdist/pull/7281). \r\n\r\nA few relevant presentations can be found here:\r\n- https://indico.cern.ch/event/1032087/contributions/4334392/attachments/2239866/3798910/HadronicShowerTrigger_EXO_LL_L1DPG_6May2021.pdf\r\n- https://indico.cern.ch/event/1032087/contributions/4334095/attachments/2241349/3800447/HLT_muon_shower_martin.pdf\r\n- https://indico.cern.ch/event/1080450/contributions/4548741/attachments/2320995/3952292/MuonShower_Oct1_Martin.pdf\r\n\r\nI'm currently waiting on a suitable dev branch to open up within cms-l1t-offline/cmssw for additional testing (rate in particular), but I wanted to go ahead and have the proposal run by L1T experts and other CMS software developers.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI tested the code on a private XML L1T menu, stripped from the regular trigger algorithms. However, as I wrote earlier, I need a branch in cms-l1t-offline/cmssw for more testing before the code can be enabled in the emulator.\r\n\r\nAdditional validation with ```scram b runtests``` and with WF 11634.0. \r\n```\r\n11634.0_TTbar_14TeV+2021+TTbar_14TeV_TuneCP5_GenSim+Digi+Reco+HARVEST+ALCA Step0-PASSED Step1-PASSED Step2-PASSED Step3-PASSED Step4-PASSED  - time date Fri Oct  1 15:25:09 2021-date Fri Oct  1 14:50:10 2021; exit: 0 0 0 0 0\r\n1 1 1 1 1 tests passed, 0 0 0 0 0 failed\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also wanted to run ```runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos```, but many WFs fail in step1 because of issues with globaltags?

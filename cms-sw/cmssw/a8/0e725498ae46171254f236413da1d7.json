As they types always known at compile time anyway, this should have no change to the behavior.\r\n\r\nI found this while looking at memory hoarding check in #40437. It wasn't that large but we might as well fix it anyway.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 4, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1689619243", "deletions": 8, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_2_X", "number": 42287, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Removed unnecessary lazy object selection in TopMonitor", "updated_at": "1689619655", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

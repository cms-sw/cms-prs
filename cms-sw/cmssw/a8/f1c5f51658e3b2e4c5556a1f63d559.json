Please bypass signatures if not signed promptly.\n\nWe are in the process of replacing boost::shared_ptr with std::shared_ptr in the framework for ROOT6, and as much as possible in ROOT 5.\nThis will require adding missing includes of \"boost/shared_ptr.hpp\" in some files outside the framework that will still use boost::shared_ptr.  This pull request does that.\nIt also adds one other missing include to ModuleDescription.h, and removes a totally unnecessary #include of \"boost/shared_ptr.hpp\" from ModuleDescription.h.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_2_X", "changed_files": 9, "closed_at": "1402550934", "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1402413176", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "core-approved", "daq-approved", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "efc780151c20b7271ff4cb39d1867ede269ad5bd", "merged_at": "1402550934", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_2_0_pre1", "number": 4193, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add missing includes", "updated_at": "1402573353", "user": "wmtan"}

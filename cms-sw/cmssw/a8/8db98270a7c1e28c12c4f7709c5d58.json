I included here core packages that I will be changing in my concurrent IOV pull request, because I want to rebase that on top of this. More PRs for other core packages coming soon.\r\n\r\nThere were a few addition changes that showed up in code-checks. I had to manually fix one line to get it to compile.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe only test I performed was checking that the revised packages compile and build.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 697, "closed_at": "1556729492", "comments": 13, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1556646657", "deletions": 52816, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "7ac438051e7ba3c56de9894520931b34320ce730", "merged_at": "1556729492", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 26579, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Framework code format", "updated_at": "1556729493", "user": "wddgit"}

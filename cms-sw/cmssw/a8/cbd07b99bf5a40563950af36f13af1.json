For detailed analyses we need to write out the pre-trigger digi as EDM products. These `CSCALCTPreTriggerDigi`'s will not be used in the CSC local trigger nor in the CSC DAQ. However, they are useful to understand the trigger and DAQ rates in Run-3 and Phase-2 (especially in ME2/1 where we are considering to lower the number of layers for an ALCT from 4 to 3).\r\n\r\nRemarks:\r\n- The `CSCALCTPreTriggerDigi` format is the same as for `CSCALCTDigi`. In the future we may want to extend the dataformat with a list of wire-groups that participated in the pre-trigger. \r\n- While there may been more than 1 ALCT pre-trigger, I'm only writing out the first one now. Writing out all of them would require some changes in the pre-trigger logic.\r\n- I included an option `savePreTriggers` which saves the pretriggers in the ROOT file. I set it to False by default.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested with WF 20434.0. \r\n```\r\n$edmEventSize -a -v step2.root | grep PreTrigger\r\nCSCDetIdCSCALCTPreTriggerDigiMuonDigiCollection_simCscTriggerPrimitiveDigis__HLT. 3076.7 481.8\r\nCSCDetIdCSCCLCTPreTriggerDigiMuonDigiCollection_simCscTriggerPrimitiveDigis__HLT. 552.8 372.2\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nFYI @tahuang1991 ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 12, "closed_at": "1573072073", "comments": 22, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1571406699", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "7458c6761ecae7be8c30581a3b0f52850617ef4f", "merged_at": "1573072073", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 28210, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "New feature: CSC ALCT pre-trigger object in CSC L1 trigger emulator", "updated_at": "1573072073", "user": "dildick"}

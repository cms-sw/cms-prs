The HLT full event content has been updated accordingly and a few more plots have been added (e.g separate efficiency measurements in the barrel, overlap, and endcap).\r\nChanges presented in the  [HLT Upgrade meeting on 3/12/2024](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1482695/contributions/6247483/subcontributions/517161/attachments/2978374/5243554/2024-12-03%20Phase%202%20validation%20and%20integration%20in%20CMSSW.pdf).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nVerified that validation plots are filled with sensible information using ZMM and TTbar RelVals and private production via runTheMatrix using workflows 29834 (TTbar) and 29850 (ZMM) at 200 PU.

This is tolerated compared with the aforementioned issue.\r\n\r\nA backport to 10_6_X is also needed.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nValidated on GEN process with `ExternalGeneratorFilter` and see that the max wait time has changed as expected.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1627110190", "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1626458881", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "generators-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "b787d9d215541699e820cf440549bf859e9ef265", "merged_at": "1627110190", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "number": 34525, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Extend the external process wait time for ExternalGeneratorFilter", "updated_at": "1627408205", "user": "colizz"}

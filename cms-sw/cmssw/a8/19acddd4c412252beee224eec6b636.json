The only important point\r\n the file that uses the 'TYPELOOKUP_DATA_REG' macro must be in the same library as the data class it is registering.\r\n```\r\n\r\nDoing this correctly, one does not have to declare the library where the macro is actually used as an additional dependency anymore if one wants to use a `edm::ESHandle<TrackerTopology>`, which would look like a fake dependency to this cleaning because it is not required by any `include` statement.\r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/FWCore/Utilities/interface/typelookup.h#L34\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCMSSW compiles.

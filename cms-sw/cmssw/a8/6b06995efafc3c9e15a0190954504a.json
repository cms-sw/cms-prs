The steps in that process don't need to be exposed to most of those modules\\*. Therefore, a standardization is introduced to reduce code duplication and inconsistencies. The `HcalHitRelabeller` class is simplified to be used as a helper class, and the `relabel` function is made into a static function so it can also be used as a standalone helper function.\r\n\r\nattn: @bsunanda, @hatakeyamak, @kencall, @lgray \r\n\r\n\\* A few modules need the layer-by-layer information; those are left alone.", "branch": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "changed_files": 33, "closed_at": "1486655260", "comments": 55, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1485953857", "deletions": 228, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "a6585755096d958d644e667373e4ce469b24383c", "merged_at": "1486655260", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "number": 17369, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 6, "state": "closed", "title": "Simplify TestNumbering handling", "updated_at": "1486655260", "user": "kpedro88"}

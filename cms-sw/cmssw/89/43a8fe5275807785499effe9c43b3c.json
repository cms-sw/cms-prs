These methods are used to select shower library branches with EM or hadronic hits. Hyperons and exotic particles will not any more treated as \"hadrons\", they should decay and only decay products will provide showers. Due to that, in some workflows one can expect different simulation histories and only statistical comparison of results is possible.\r\n\r\nAdditionally some commented lines and unused variables are removed.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 13, "comments": 8, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1518011252", "deletions": 194, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_1_X", "number": 22145, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Geant4 Sensitive Detectors update 4: revised selection of particle type for shower libraries", "updated_at": "1518033868", "user": "civanch"}

With the `HOST_DEVICE_CONSTANT` defined in #37159 it is possible to define the arrays in device memory and use the values.\r\n\r\nHowever, using `HOST_DEVICE_CONSTANT` is not possible if the arrays are members of a class and so they are moved to namespaces and constant pointers to the arrays are used in the classes (https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/36311#issuecomment-1060844740).\r\n\r\nThis PR builds on PR #37159 \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCompiles and passes 11634.512 on a CPU-only machine and on an GPU equipped machine.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 2, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1646675246", "deletions": 12, "labels": ["simulation-pending", "core-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 37161, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 5, "state": "open", "title": "ECAL - Make EcalConstants constexpr arrays compatible with CUDA code", "updated_at": "1646726746", "user": "thomreis"}

A description of the bugs and the negative taggers in general can be found in this presentation at the BTV meeting [1].\r\n\r\nIt was also discovered that in the method used for producing inclusive secondary vertices, there is a cut on the angle between the vertex flight direction and the direction of the track sum. This cut needs to be inverted for a negative tagger, so a vertexing sequence with correct cuts for a negative tagger has been introduced.\r\n\r\nIn the plot [2] the negative tagger of DeepCSV is shown. The negative tagger discriminator values are shown from -1 to 0, and the full tagger is shown from 0 to 1.\r\n\r\n[1] https://indico.cern.ch/event/713923/contributions/2938152/attachments/1620844/2578707/NegativeTagger.pdf\r\n\r\n[2]\r\n![deepcsvnegativetagger](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33452471/40061942-5945600a-585a-11e8-9b78-1286ab57791a.png)\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 11, "comments": 38, "commits": 18, "created_at": "1526386688", "deletions": 69, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 23206, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 19, "state": "open", "title": "DeepCSV and CSVv2 negative tagger bugfix", "updated_at": "1527784965", "user": "emilbols"}

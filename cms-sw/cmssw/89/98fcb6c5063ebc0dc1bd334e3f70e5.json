This sample thus produces displaced leptons.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, there are a few changes and additions:\r\n- The stop mass was updated from 300 GeV to 800 GeV, in order to use a mass that has not yet been excluded. The stop lifetime was updated from 1000mm to 500mm in order to increase the tracker acceptance for displaced tracks. (The \"DisplacedSUSY_stopToB_M_300_1000mm_13\" gen fragment and WFs were removed and replaced by \"DisplacedSUSY_stopToB_M_800_500mm_13\" ones.)\r\n- In addition to the 13 TeV WFs, 14 TeV WFs were added, in order to validate changes for Run 3 and Phase 2.\r\n\r\nThis sample was agreed upon in https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/PDMVRELVALS-96.\r\n\r\nI believe the most interesting WFs will be:\r\n- 23324.0 (2026D49, 14 TeV, no PU)\r\n- 23524.0 (2026D49, 14 TeV, PU)\r\n- 11724.0 (2021, 14 TeV, no PU)\r\n- 11924.0 (2021, 14 TeV, PU)\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis PR passes the basic unit tests and code quality checks. I have also successfully tested WF 23285.0 locally.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nnot a backport\r\n\r\nFYI @mtosi @vmariani @elusiani @fernance @lowette @nsaoulid @kdipetri @mcitron @jandrea @blochd @mmasciov @chayanit @srappocc\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1602196605", "comments": 18, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1602052755", "deletions": 84, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "generators-approved", "orp-approved", "pdmv-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "a03f63d233d1c4aceb928ab1fbbd1e676f48e78e", "merged_at": "1602196605", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 31692, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "update of \"DisplacedSUSY\" relvals for TRK and EXO validation of displaced tracks, for Run 3 and Phase 2", "updated_at": "1602196606", "user": "jalimena"}

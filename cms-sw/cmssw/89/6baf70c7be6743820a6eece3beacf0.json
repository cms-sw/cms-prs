This PR should fix this behaviour. \r\n**N.B.: I am assuming that the client is run in `live` mode also when it's run in playback. As I am not sure, this is a RFC.**\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n`scram b runtests_TestDQMOnlineClient-beam_dqm_sourceclient use-ibeos` runs to completion.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

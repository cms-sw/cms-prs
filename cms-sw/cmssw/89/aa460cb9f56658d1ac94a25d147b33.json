These thicknesses are the same as in all scenarios previous to D38, and this geometry is needed to disentangle differences between D38 and D35 due to the bar orientation and to the crystal thickness.\r\n\r\nA complete set of upgrade test workflows is added. All the other parameters are kept the same, and also the MTD Topology scenario is the same as for D38.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 12, "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1547309399", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "geometry-pending", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "upgrade-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_5_X", "number": 25639, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "MTD geometry: add scenario D39 equal to D38 but for the crystal thickness", "updated_at": "1547324643", "user": "fabiocos"}

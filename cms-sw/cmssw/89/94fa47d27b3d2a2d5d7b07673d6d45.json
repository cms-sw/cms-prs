The simplest solution to avoid accumulating files is to disable the PB file production in all clients, because:\r\n\r\n- They were created for the New DQMGUI, that is not deployed (which means we are wasting resources generating those files).\r\n- It is easier to replace only this file (if not used outside DQM) instead of disabling the PB production in each client.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested in DQM Playback environment, all plots behaving as expected and PB files are not created anymore.\r\n\r\nThe original `dqmSaver` (PB) EDAnalyzer is called from the DQM clients under `DQM/Integration/python/clients` (results found using `grep -rn  \"dqmSaverPB\" *`, the [BeamMonitor test](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/DQM/BeamMonitor/test/Online_BeamMonitor_file.py#L96) and following files in EventFilter (results found using `grep -rn  \"DQMFileSaverPB_cfi\" *`):\r\n\r\n- [EventFilter/Utilities/test/startFU.py#L167](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/EventFilter/Utilities/test/startFU.py#L167)\r\n- [EventFilter/Utilities/test/unittest_FU.py#L178](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/EventFilter/Utilities/test/unittest_FU.py#L178)\r\n- [EventFilter/Utilities/test/unittest_FU_daqsource.py#L171](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/EventFilter/Utilities/test/unittest_FU_daqsource.py#L171)\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the original EDAnalyzer seems to be ignored in HLTTrigger confdb, given the following:\r\n\r\n- [HLTrigger/Configuration/python/Tools/confdb.py#L701](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/HLTrigger/Configuration/python/Tools/confdb.py#L701)\r\n\r\nAny input on this is appreciated, since later on a flag with the same name seems to be written in the auto generated file:\r\n\r\n- [HLTrigger/Configuration/python/Tools/confdb.py#L814](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/HLTrigger/Configuration/python/Tools/confdb.py#L814)", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 2, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1731335789", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_2_X", "number": 46662, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "refactor: disable DQM pb files production", "updated_at": "1731336100", "user": "gabrielmscampos"}

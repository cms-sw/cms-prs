From a first (non-expert) look, this seems to come from [here](https://github.com/cms-sw/cms-bot/blob/9c756b35f970eb001038cb70512f3d0334e50e29/report-pull-request-results.py#L145), where the logic might fail if the log file of two different tests has the same basename (which is the case for the 2nd test in `hlt_mc_Fake2` and `hlt_data_Fake2`, given the limit of 150 characters).\r\nThe cheap workaround is to make log-file names unique by making them slightly longer. Of course, it might be better to improve the \"file-finding\" logic in cms-bot, but that is left to experts.\r\n\r\nIn other words, maybe this is not the right fix, and I'm opening the PR mainly to bring this to the attention of experts.\r\n\r\nWould require https://github.com/cms-sw/cms-bot/pull/1675.\r\n\r\nMerely technical. No changes expected.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nChecked that the log-file names of the `addOnTests` would now be unique.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nN/A", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 0, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1638986041", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["core-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 36423, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "increase max length of `addOnTests` log-file names", "updated_at": "1638986059", "user": "missirol"}

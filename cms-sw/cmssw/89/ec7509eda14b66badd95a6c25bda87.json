This\ncould have been changed to being done in the constructor. However,\nany data already stored may or may not have had indexCombos_ updated\n(since indexCombos_ is stored) and therefore we still must do a\ndelayed fill. This is made thread safe via the use of a std::atomic\nwhich keeps track of the state of indexCombos_. The new std::atomic\nis declared transient and placed next to bool member data in order\nto avoid extra padding by the compiler.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1383687695", "comments": 4, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1383597699", "deletions": 80, "labels": ["fully-signed", "l1-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "9b4c243d62547b8100d4257b1a547edd63087d8c", "merged_at": "1383687695", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_0_0_pre8", "number": 1326, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fill mutable in L1ParticleMap in a thread-safe way", "updated_at": "1384437400", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

DQMRootOutputModule\r\nonly has write methods. It does not have endRun or endLumi methods\r\nso there is no reason for it to consume endRun or endLumi DQMToken\r\nproducts. The write methods are already sequenced by the Framework\r\nto execute after endRun or endLumi methods that could produce DQMTokens\r\nare finished.\r\n\r\nThis was motivated by the migration to remove all consumesMany calls\r\nfrom CMSSW. That function has been deprecated.\r\n\r\nFYI @makortel @Dr15Jones \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThere should be no change in behavior. No tests were added.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1680541158", "comments": 12, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1679603181", "deletions": 9, "labels": ["dqm-approved", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "hold", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_1_X", "number": 41166, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Remove unnecessary calls to consumesMany in DQMRootOutputModule", "updated_at": "1680541158", "user": "wddgit"}

The original idea was that the downstream code should look both at the asymmetry flag and at the anode status values in order to figure out whether the rechit should be rejected. However, this was never done. Currently, the simplest solution appears to be to calculate the charge asymmetry in reco only when both anodes have the \"OK\" status. This pull request gives HF reco this capability, but it is not turned on yet. The plan is to turn it on after some additional validation is performed by the HF Noise Studies Group.\r\n\r\nThis pull request will not modify any MC or data results.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1539666269", "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1539043622", "deletions": 19, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "f440c6f6d20d96e013ad309d9bc6cc85e6c52a76", "merged_at": "1539666269", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_4_X", "number": 24832, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Added the capability to switch the mode of charge asymmetry evaluation", "updated_at": "1539666269", "user": "igv4321"}

Fix can be easily done by renaming is_Rhadron() to s_isgluinoHadron to reflect what the code is really doing and add the stop and sbottom to the CustomPhysicsList.\r\nMore details\r\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/1012481/contributions/4248900/attachments/2198166/3716919/SlidesMCTests20210226.pdf\r\nand\r\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/963050/contributions/4051179/attachments/2116681/3565085/SlidesMCDebug20201006.pdf\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles, physics validation done in the talks linked above\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\nThis is not a backport, but a backport is planned\r\n\r\ncc: @tadams16 @carolinecollard \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1626302452", "comments": 14, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1626175209", "deletions": 7, "labels": ["bug-fix", "code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "9286da1d57948a956863a0820fbb5382bcbb930c", "merged_at": "1626302452", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "number": 34459, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Make stop/sbottom R-hadrons use the cloud model", "updated_at": "1626302452", "user": "tvami"}

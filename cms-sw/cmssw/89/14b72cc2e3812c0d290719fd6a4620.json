This occurs because of the redundant reconstruction for Muons above 100 GeV (highPtTkMu, MuCascade, ...). \r\n\r\nThis issue was presented in the following [XPOG meeting](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1450394/contributions/6106083/attachments/2921241/5127468/XPOG_Muon_Sept24.pdf), where this solution was proposed.\r\n\r\nAs a further check, we tested other objects that may be affected by this change (possible duplicates):\r\n\r\n- Muons (Main target)\r\n- Tau\r\n- FatJet\r\n- HT\r\n- MHT\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if this solution affect in any negative way other objects than Muons, we propose to modify the IF condition such that the pT matching is bypass only for Muon IDs\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1726828212", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "xpog-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_2_X", "number": 46072, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Fix duplication of TrigObj in nanoAOD", "updated_at": "1726868913", "user": "BlancoFS"}

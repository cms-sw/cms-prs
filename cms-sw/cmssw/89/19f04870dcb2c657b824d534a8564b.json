So here is the pull request. \r\n\r\nIt adds the needed VID classes to calculate the cut, adds a function to EcalClusterTools too calculate the number of saturated crystals in the 5x5 region of the detector. It also adds a new class to make isolation from pat::PackedCandidates and a producer to make the isolation and nrSat crystal value maps to be picked up by the VID cuts.\r\n\r\nThis is not yet run in any  default sequence (and nor is it intended to be just yet) and the goal of this is for it to get in 80X to ensure that analysers can use it easily.  So this is a strict addition of things and does not change anything already running.\r\n\r\nIt has a weak dependence on https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/16777 in that it will crash when running on AOD without it. But its not run in standard sequences, only by analysers who will know to ensure that they have that PR. It will work fine for the miniAOD. \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nSam\r\n\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "changed_files": 21, "closed_at": "1483684684", "comments": 52, "commits": 18, "created_at": "1481214240", "deletions": 30, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-available", "orp-approved", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "c8032082bfb4b12374ac015ead89294583f4c3cf", "merged_at": "1483684684", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "number": 16913, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 11, "state": "closed", "title": "HEEP V7.0 in 90X", "updated_at": "1483684718", "user": "Sam-Harper"}

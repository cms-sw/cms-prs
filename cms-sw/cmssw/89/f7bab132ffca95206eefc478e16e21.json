As is `das-up-to-nevents.py` , checks if we are running within Jenkins. This was done at the time since, to simplify `das-up-to-nevents` when running PR tests, just to avoid crashes. In https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/49020 and https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/49045 the crashes were understood to be coming from accessing the certification web page too many times. Now the bot access the JSONs from `cvmfs`. \r\n\r\nThis PR proposes to just remove the `testing` limitation for the bot, allowing PR tests to use certified lumisections. \r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1765863052", "deletions": 20, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_0_X", "number": 49636, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Removing `JENKINS` Check from `das-up-to-nevents.py`", "updated_at": "1765863226", "user": "AdrianoDee"}

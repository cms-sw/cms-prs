It includes the same era modifiers (highBetaStar_2018, egamma_lowPt_exclusive and run3_upc) introduced in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/43378 on top of the Run2_2016 era.\r\n\r\nA new relval 142.903 is added to test the new era. This relval will require a new run2 data global tag including the low pT egamma regression and dEdx calibration tags, which for the time being are included in the relval through a customize command (temporary customization to be able to test the PR, to be removed after the GT is updated and before the PR is merged).\r\n\r\nMore details on the validations done are documented in the [slide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18ilaOBCV2QTQBy2ta3PF4OJzp66C_OpOPBUrQdOh0Dg/edit?usp=sharing)\r\n\r\n@mandrenguyen \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested using the relvals 180,180.1,181,181.1,141.901,142.901,142.903\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

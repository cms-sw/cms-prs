This is switched on (only) for all phase 2 scenarios for the moment, and timing information is therefore automatically used in the timing scenarios\r\n\r\nThis means that primary vertex reconstruction and sorting, CHS and Puppi Jets and MET now fully make use of timing information for charged particles in the relevant scenarios.\r\n\r\n@lgray @gpetruc @arizzi @violatingcp \r\n\r\n@isobelojalvo depending on exactly how the inputs to the tau reconstruction are arranged, these changes to PFPileup and CHS may already partly propagate there (and if not should be easy to adapt tau reco such that they do)\nAutomatically ported from CMSSW_9_0_X #17238 (original by @bendavid).\nPlease wait for a new IB (12 to 24H) before requesting to test this PR.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 42, "closed_at": "1490336041", "comments": 12, "commits": 31, "created_at": "1488454597", "deletions": 119, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-available", "core-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-rejected", "simulation-pending", "tests-approved", "upgrade-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_9_1_X", "number": 17730, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Complete propagation of precision timing to reconstruction and MiniAOD", "updated_at": "1491818162", "user": "cmsbuild"}

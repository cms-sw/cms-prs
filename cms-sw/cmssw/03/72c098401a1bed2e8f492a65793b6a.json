Unfortunately, the virtual keyword was not added in TrackBase, just a comment stating (incorrectly) that the destructor was virtual.  This is a bug, as the class needs a virtual destructor.\nThis request merely adds the virtual keyword to the destructor to fix the bug.  It was tested with checkdeps -a, and the unit tests pass.\n\nThis is a trivial C++ bug fix that has nothing really to do with RECO, so if it is not signed in a timely manner, I suggest that the signature be bypassed.\n\nThe bug causes a unit test failure in CommonTools/Utils when the Reflex functionality for invoking functions is replaced by ROOT.  So, this fix is needed.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1375189170", "comments": 6, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1374782939", "deletions": 3, "labels": [], "merge_commit_sha": "fc6d1501e312ee2e3fd9f90972f687cb0cbdf4c1", "merged_at": "1375189170", "merged_by": "nclopezo", "number": 187, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Really make reco::TrackBase destructor virtual", "updated_at": "1406835442", "user": "wmtan"}

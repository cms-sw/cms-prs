Cuts on delta_pt/pt were added for the Pandora PF objects to reject misreconstructed tracks. These cuts had the desired effect of removing jets/charged hadrons with unphysically high energies.\n\nBefore:\n![pfjetenergy_before_deltapt_cut](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4672808/6456695/a1092bd2-c12d-11e4-873f-a5b498def7a8.png)\n\nAfter:\n![pfjetenergy_after_deltapt_cut](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4672808/6456697/a8c9a6b2-c12d-11e4-9500-ad77533825d4.png)\n\nPlease include this PR in the release with the other HGCal Pandora PRs. This is important for physics performance.\n\nAttn: @vandreev11 @pfs @sethzenz\n", "branch": "CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1425374202", "comments": 5, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1425354400", "deletions": 7, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "new-package-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "1e4f7709a31f062fb8c65d9b0ca47c00082d1ad8", "merged_at": "1425374202", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "number": 8023, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Topic pandora track cleaning", "updated_at": "1425374202", "user": "kpedro88"}

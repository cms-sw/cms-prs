In the future, more information could be provided through the status flag of the PFEgammaExtra. When it is done, the present code will just keep it and no longer recompute it. \n\nF.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1396631077", "comments": 11, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1395059701", "deletions": 16, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "0f54a15b89f7ab0f8c5126e93e7ead0532715a4f", "merged_at": "1396631077", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_1_0_pre6", "number": 2890, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix provenance of electrons", "updated_at": "1500637514", "user": "beaudett"}

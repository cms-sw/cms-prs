Similarly, the change we implemented takes the SrFlags collection and produce a new collections storing only the flags matched to digis that are finally kept in the stream output.\r\n\r\nThe BuildFile.xml must have a new line to include a header used by the source.\r\n\r\nTested from release CMSSW_9_4_0_pre2 running the (updated) HLT configuration on HLTPhysics dataset.

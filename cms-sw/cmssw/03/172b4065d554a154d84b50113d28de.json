The solution is to extend the lookup table by 1 (it's generated in a loop based on the size of the updated constant). Firmware HLS does not currently match this, but HLS behavior with out-of-bounds access is not the same as C++\r\n\r\nParasitically, a review comment is addressed, cleaning up the code somewhat (unnecessary explicit setting of values to 0, which were already initialized as such).

It makes `DTDataIntegrityTask` concurrent-lumi-safe (as far as I can tell) by moving the counter for the number of events per lumi to LuminosityBlockCache. Earlier the counter could have counted events from other lumis and being reset to 0 in the middle of a lumi when concurrent lumis are enabled.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nIf this DQM module is used in offline DQM run in Tier0, I'd backport to 13_0_X.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 4, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1685963532", "deletions": 16, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_2_X", "number": 41874, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Move events/LS counter to LuminosityBlockCache in DTDataIntegrityTask", "updated_at": "1685974484", "user": "makortel"}

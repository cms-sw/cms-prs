(In the previous version 'PropagatorWithMaterial' was used for both propagation steps.)\r\n- Fix-II\r\n   - Seeds are created on the outermost 2 layers:\r\n      - The layer counter was not properly initialized before we proceed to step (2)\r\n      - Has been fixed, initialized to 0 before layers are found for generating seeds using\r\nTSOS at muon station\r\n      - Scale factors have been optimized for different rapidity ranges:\r\n           - Smaller scale factor in Barrel and Larger in the Endcap Use more eta bins \r\n\r\n- Fix-III\r\n  - Optimize eta range where hits on stereo TEC dets are used to build seeds\r\n    -  Before: If the L2 muon is 0.8-1.6\r\n        - Create seeds using the stereo modules\r\n        - Skip the modules without stereo hits\r\n    - Now: \r\n       - Range is optimized to: (1.1 to 2.0 ) and (2.15 to 2.4)", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1525718065", "deletions": 556, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-started"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 23162, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Fixes to L3 Muon OI SeedGenerator (TSGForOI) for improved efficiency", "updated_at": "1525719756", "user": "bmahakud"}

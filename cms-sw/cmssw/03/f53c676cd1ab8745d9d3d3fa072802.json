The results we obtain are as expected.\r\n\r\n@fabio-mon @pfs \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1765957333", "comments": 18, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1765464164", "deletions": 8, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved", "hgcal-dpg-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "efbaa01b5f5030445dd6cc10825a6eb57611f11e", "merged_at": "1765957333", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_16_0_X", "number": 49608, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix HGCAL EM scale factor application", "updated_at": "1765957334", "user": "RSalvatico"}

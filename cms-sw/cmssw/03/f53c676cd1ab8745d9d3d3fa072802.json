The results we obtain are as expected.\r\n\r\n@fabio-mon @pfs \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 12, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1765464164", "deletions": 8, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved", "hgcal-dpg-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_0_X", "number": 49608, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Fix HGCAL EM scale factor application", "updated_at": "1765871477", "user": "RSalvatico"}

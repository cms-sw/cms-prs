Note that\ngetCentralityBinsFromDB is being removed\ninstead of being repaired to use an alternative\nfor the following reasons.\n\nFirst, nothing in the release calls it. The\nonly thing that references it is one commented\nout line of code.\n\nThe function is in a DataFormats package and\naccesses the EventSetup. This dependence is\nnot allowed.\n\nThe function is used in modules and pulls\nconfiguration parameters from the top level\nparameter set instead of from the parameter\nset of the module that uses it. This is only\nallowed in very special cases. If this function\nwas to be repaired in the future it should be\nredesigned to get its configuration parameters\nfrom the module in some way.\n\nAlso made related fixes to the header includes.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1435163275", "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1435085337", "deletions": 53, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 9843, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Remove function getCentralityBinsFromDB", "updated_at": "1474632186", "user": "wddgit"}

I've commented all of those out (otherwise we deliberately include in the IB several workflows which will stay broken for at least a week). We'll have to run 135.8 in pre7; once we have its output, update the matrix\n- there were 3 other modifications necessary (miniaod of pu full sim, recycly of gen-sim) cheers, g.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1423818287", "comments": 11, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1423784214", "deletions": 8, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "fastsim-approved", "fully-signed", "pdmv-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "3bb938425345d234bd23fda442effbe64d7def92", "merged_at": "1423818287", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 7716, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fast sim wf lukas", "updated_at": "1423820833", "user": "franzoni"}

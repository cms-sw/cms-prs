The filter types `HLT1Tau` and `HLT2MuonTau` used in 2011 HLT menu were not recognized (an oversight by me). The other warning about \"not finding any paths matching to regex\" I silenced by decreasing the message level to LogInfo. We will probably anyway move in the near future to monitor all tau paths in a generic way, making this regex-path matching (and the now-LogInfo message) obsolete.\n\nFYI @mbluj\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1393332066", "comments": 4, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1392970531", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "0ecaebd32e45425b3e6e049c317e57ad6ef05c15", "merged_at": "1393332066", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_1_0_pre5", "number": 2574, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix/silence warnings in tau trigger DQM", "updated_at": "1476951381", "user": "makortel"}

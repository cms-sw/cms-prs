It would also result in that parameter being misconfigured to \"`None`\" in `ConfDB`, if instances of that ESProducer were to be used in HLT configs, which is currently not the case.\r\n\r\nI think `ConfDB` takes the values from `caloParams_2018_v1_0_ECALZS_inconsistent_cfi`, which inherits the misconfigured parameter from `caloParams_cfi`, so fixing only the latter would suffice. On the other hand, the fix is applied also to other `cfi`s, as I saw no disadvantage in doing that.\r\n\r\nThis PR only contains the minimal fix needed for `ConfDB`. The removal of type-specifications for parameter values of cloned modules is not applied, and is left to the maintainers of this package (coincidentally, this is being discussed in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/36644#pullrequestreview-847155305).\r\n\r\nMerely technical.

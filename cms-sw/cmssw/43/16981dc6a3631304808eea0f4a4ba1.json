This is currently prevented by a defensive check that disallows reading products in a release prior to the release in which the product was created. This pull request adds a configurable option \"bypassVersionCheck\" to bypass this check. See\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/299538/material/slides/1.pdf\nfor the XEB report in which this commitment is documented.\nThis pull request is for 6_2_X only. It needs to be customized for other release cycles.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_6_2_X", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1405055301", "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1405022178", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "core-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "Next CMSSW_6_2_X", "number": 4608, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Allow option of reading of files with prior releases (for 6_2_X)", "updated_at": "1408975762", "user": "wmtan"}

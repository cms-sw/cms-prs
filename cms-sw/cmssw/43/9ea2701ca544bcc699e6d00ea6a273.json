These vertices will get a very low score if other well measured vertices exist (instead of zero score now). If all vertices are like that (most often the case for pp in B=0T), the number of tracks associated to the vertex becomes the score. This is somewhat more sensible than a rather random sum of pt^2 (track pt in B=0T is not well defined).\n\nThe fixes are a follow up to the bug reported in https://hypernews.cern.ch/HyperNews/CMS/get/recoDevelopment/1415.html\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1453003032", "comments": 10, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1452919922", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "b2282de8a06f44da37d013cfd794d55bf7af7faf", "merged_at": "1453003032", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 12969, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "fix to PV sorting when all track momenta are not well measured (B=0T case mainly)", "updated_at": "1453003032", "user": "slava77"}

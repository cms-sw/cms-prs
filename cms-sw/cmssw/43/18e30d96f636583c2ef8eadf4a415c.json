Hence, for all the\r\ndetids belonging to the same wafer, the mid position of the\r\nwafer is returned, instead of the more accurate pad's\r\nposition. This PR introduces a small adapter for the HGCAL\r\nCaloCell that internally stores the correct position for\r\neach pad and returns it via the usual interface. No changes\r\nare required anywhere in the code except for the code\r\nresponsible to import HGCAL RecHit as PFRecHits. This is a\r\nhack that will disappear as soon as a proper CaloGeometry\r\nfor the HGCAL detector is in place.", "branch": "CMSSW_9_3_X", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1506594339", "comments": 17, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1506083388", "deletions": 7, "labels": ["backport-ok", "comparison-available", "geometry-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "77a56992decb5812bb00025e7be067ab2b24f1bf", "merged_at": "1506594338", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_3_X", "number": 20630, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Properly compute PFRecHit position for HGCAL", "updated_at": "1506594339", "user": "rovere"}

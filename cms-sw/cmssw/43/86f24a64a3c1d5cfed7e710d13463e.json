The Mixing Module allows the bunch space to be updated on run or lumi boundaries.  If this happened, the adjuster would still use the original value.\n\nThis simple pull request fixes this by passing in the bunch space as an argument, rather than storing it as a member of the Adjuster class.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1386228106", "comments": 4, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1386112805", "deletions": 13, "labels": ["fully-signed", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "8fd56eb275351da340117d054ee9c1bc1839d29c", "merged_at": "1386228106", "merged_by": "nclopezo", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_0_0_pre10", "number": 1662, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Don't store bunchspace as it may be updated", "updated_at": "1406909523", "user": "wmtan"}

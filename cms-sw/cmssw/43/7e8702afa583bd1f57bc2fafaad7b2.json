Each module number has its own histogram named as PositionOfClusters_2S_<module number>. This creates 24 histograms in barrel layers 4-6 and the following amount in the endcaps:\r\n\r\nTEDD 1\r\nRing 11: 52\r\nRing 12: 60\r\nRing 13: 64\r\nRing 14: 72\r\nRing 15: 76\r\n\r\nTEDD 2\r\nRing 8: 52 \r\nRing 9: 56 \r\nRing 10: 64\r\nRing 11: 68\r\nRing 12: 76\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1401\" height=\"835\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e73330f-df6e-404b-bcec-18b7fc516a38\" />\r\n\r\nPositive y bins are on the top sensor of the module, with negative y bins on the bottom. 1 or 2 indicates the half-sensor. It is possible to view the whole 2S module on one plot.\r\n\r\n**PositionOfClusters_2SLadder** shows the total number of clusters in each module in a ladder. Similarly to the module view it produces different number of histograms per layer:\r\nLayer 4: 48 ladders\r\nLayer 5: 60 ladders\r\nLayer 6: 76 ladders\r\n\r\nThis histogram shows modules before the collision point with a negative value and after the collision point with a positive value. Technically, it displays 2 ladders per plot as the - and + ladders are not the same structure.\r\n<img width=\"1401\" height=\"835\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce29ebf5-f3cb-452c-878f-431b184732c4\" />\r\n\r\nThese histograms are proposed to show data primarily from the cosmic rack.\r\n\r\nPR was validated by running the Phase-2 tracker DQM and checking the ROOT result", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 8, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1764154306", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "trk"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_1_X", "number": 49482, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 4, "state": "open", "title": "Phase 2 - Add new tracker DQM histograms showing OT cluster position in 2S modules & ladders", "updated_at": "1766139432", "user": "ljuckett"}

During the presentation it was suggested to enlarge the lostTrack collection to include the missing tracks, and we have found this alternative does not increase significantly the dataformat size, and is easier to use. \r\n\r\nThis PR includes:\r\n+ All tracks with pt > 2 that are not PF candidates are stored in the lostTrack collection.\r\n+ lostTracks that are the innerTrack of a muon are assigned with a pdgId of +/- 13.\r\n+ Module to cross-clean pfCandidates, lostTracks and slimmedMuons collections\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/27889\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nThis PR has been validated with 136.8311\r\n\r\n@dntaylor @gkaratha @peruzzim\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1587451316", "comments": 42, "commits": 11, "created_at": "1585911775", "deletions": 9, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "6b5b453ac018d4912c3c002227098b67c6f254c9", "merged_at": "1587451316", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 29389, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 10, "state": "closed", "title": "Update of the lostTrack collection for MUO", "updated_at": "1587451316", "user": "sscruz"}

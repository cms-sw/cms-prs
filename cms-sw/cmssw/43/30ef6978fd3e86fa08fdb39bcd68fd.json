The new implementation allows to use the same tag for more record+labels in a GT, which was producing an error previously.\nThis is fully back-ward compatible ( while a new GT with more then one entry with the same tag will be readable only by this code )\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1463551769", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1463321544", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["comparison-available", "db-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "c06bc086532d7b5549095f499c2632b947e195a6", "merged_at": "1463551769", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 14507, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix for GTEntry_t hash function", "updated_at": "1463551769", "user": "ggovi"}

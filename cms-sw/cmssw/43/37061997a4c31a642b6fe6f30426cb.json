Can be plugged into a producer+analyzer module to re-emulate and then analyze the CSC trigger primitives from select chambers at P5. Can also be used to mask certain bad chambers.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles. Tested on recent ME+2/1/15 data. The data file below contains histograms from events with the ME+2/1/15 in run 345476 during which we had Phase-2 upgrade firmware enabled. After some internal communication it turned out that the chamber was still incorrectly configured, so the comparisons aren't that useful (but the filter works as expected).\r\n\r\n[CSC_dataVsEmul_CMS_Run_345476.pdf](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/files/7367034/CSC_dataVsEmul_CMS_Run_345476.pdf)\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nN/A", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 13, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1634567738", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-rejected"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "number": 35717, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 8, "state": "open", "title": "Simple CSC digi and TP filter for Run-3 studies", "updated_at": "1634903560", "user": "dildick"}

No worsening of the tracking performance in the Phase-1 reconstruction was observed following these changes ([validation plots here](https://cernbox.cern.ch/s/IRM9k1zOHcS79ZD)).\r\n- Two process modifiers have been introduced:\r\n  - `splitClustersInPhase2Pixel`, enabling an `InitialStepPreSplitting` to produce a collection of split clusters for use in the `InitialStep`;\r\n  - `jetCoreInPhase2`, enabling the JetCore iteration in the Phase-2 Tracking.\r\n- Two workflow offsets have been added:\r\n  - `0.19001` activates the `splitClustersInPhase2Pixel` process modifier;\r\n  - `0.19002` activates both the `splitClustersInPhase2Pixel` and the `jetCoreInPhase2` modifiers.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n- Compiles fine after `git cms-checkdeps -a -A`.\r\n- `export CMS_PATH=/cvmfs/cms-ib.cern.ch/ ; export SITECONFIG_PATH=/cvmfs/cms-ib.cern.ch/SITECONF/local/ ; scram b runtests`: no failing test.\r\n- `runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos`: no failing test.\r\n- Tested with step 3 on RelVals from DAS (`TTBar_14TeV` + PU and `QCD_FlatPt_15_3000HS_14` without PU), runs to completion.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

A \"Warning\" level message is now only issued if the number of non-empty payloads unpacked by a particular unpacker is less than a configurable threshold, typically 1 for data and MC standard sequences.  This handles as best as possible for now, the somewhat complicated situation in Calo packing/unpacking.  In contexts where we are e.g. unpacking Stage-2 in 2015 data (where it is unreliably available) the requirement is lowered to zero, to avoid unnecessary warnings.  Info level messages are always provided for expert use.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1463893806", "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1463746711", "deletions": 14, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-pending", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "493d55a9319a01fc5b1056d2418666bdda0c3368", "merged_at": "1463893806", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 14591, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Clean-up L1T unpacker warnings", "updated_at": "1463893806", "user": "mulhearn"}

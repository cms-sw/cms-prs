TOP/HIG with Run 2 UL campaigns. The changes replace earlier changes which affect only decay chains of exotic particles, and extends the behavior to cover all decay chains. Future development may include tweaking the FastSim decayer to be as identical to FullSim as possible. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nDistributions of all quantities in the NANO were examined for their impact in ttbar events [1]. Almost all changes are desirable, and some are very much needed, e.g., the MET [2]\r\n\r\n[1] https://www.desy.de/~beinsam/FastSim/Nano/6July2022/TTbar/\r\n[2] https://www.desy.de/~beinsam/FastSim/Nano/6July2022/TTbar/CaloMET_pt.png\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nThis PR is a backport of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/38813, which should be merged for all future FastSim productions in CMSSW_10_6_X, e.g., UL requests.

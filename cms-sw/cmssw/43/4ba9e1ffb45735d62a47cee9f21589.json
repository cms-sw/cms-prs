The purpose for this addition is motivated by a need to filter POWHEG ttbb 4f samples during generation in a way that works uniformly across every decay channel.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nValidated with the addition of the filter to a McM test script from `TOP-Run3Summer23wmLHEGS`.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nBackport of #48250 + it's later fixes. This is targeting `13_0_X` for use in 2023 Run 3 sample generation.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1770316563", "deletions": 14, "labels": ["generators-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "number": 50049, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[13_0_X] Add scalar sum to LHEPtFilter", "updated_at": "1771624844", "user": "jsamudio"}

This PR is a bug fix, since the V0 validation itself is included in trackingOnly validation.\n\nTested in CMSSW_8_1_X_2016-08-11-2300, no changes expected in phase0/phase1 full-reco workflows. In workflows using trackingOnly validation (e.g. `1325.1`, or phase2 at the moment) there should be no changes in existing histograms, only V0 efficiency and fake rate histograms should appear.\n\n@rovere @VinInn \n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1471357644", "comments": 12, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1470986756", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "c435e118ea03d94b217f0ecd868249219ec74abf", "merged_at": "1471357644", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 15444, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Include also V0 post-processor to trackingOnly postValidation", "updated_at": "1471357644", "user": "makortel"}

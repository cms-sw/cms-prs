(#38062)\r\n* runType in GEM AMC was valid in the old data format. But in the new data format, we didn't assign any bits for it.\r\n* Recently, we realized that the GEMAMCStatus arose an error because of the unused bits in the new version of format.\r\n* This PR fix the issue.\r\n* We expect small changes from the unpacked GEM digi. And the changes will propagate to GEM local reconstruction results.\r\n* A backport to CMSSW_13_0_X is needed for 2023 data taking.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n* The code format has applied with `scram build code-format` and tested with `scram build code-checks`.\r\n* The branch has tested with `runTheMatrix.py` scenarios which is using 2022 data.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1682594691", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["simulation-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_1_X", "number": 41444, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[GEM][Bug Fix] GEMAMC runType is not used in the latest data format", "updated_at": "1682595209", "user": "yeckang"}

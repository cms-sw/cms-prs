As expected, the blue histograms are always larger than the red ones - additional evens are recuperated. All other columns are related to multi-RP reconstruction, not affected by the bug neither this fix.\r\n\r\n![make_cmp](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17830858/56913664-86cfd080-6ab2-11e9-8574-40284695beed.png)\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1556649467", "comments": 14, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1556550995", "deletions": 10, "labels": ["bug-fix", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "1e6db261c37c569b49cbde0f9d85b670145b176d", "merged_at": "1556649466", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 26568, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "PPS: fix in proton reconstruction", "updated_at": "1556649467", "user": "jan-kaspar"}

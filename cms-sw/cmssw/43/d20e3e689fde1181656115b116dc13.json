With this PR, the calculated sum of the pTs of the unclustered particles is stored, and can be accessed with metSumPtUnclustered(), similar to metSignificance().\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTests passed\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nbackport of #28370 \r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "changed_files": 9, "closed_at": "1587482151", "comments": 18, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1587386020", "deletions": 24, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "backport-ok", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "42c407b2de5f03f6a6aa737e3cd4f0bf563b156c", "merged_at": "1587482151", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 29521, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 8, "state": "closed", "title": "keeping METsumPtUnclustered (backport of #28370)", "updated_at": "1587482152", "user": "danbarto"}

This is needed to produce NLO samples enriched in photons, as for tW + photons from decay (cfr. https://indico.cern.ch/event/1293201/contributions/5434786/attachments/2659639/4606878/twa_sample_generation.pdf ;\r\nhttps://its.cern.ch/jira/projects/CMSTOPMCREQ/issues/CMSTOPMCREQ-33?filter=allopenissues&orderby=cf%5B14808%5D+ASC%2C+priority+DESC%2C+updated+DESC)\r\n\r\nPR validation:\r\nI have tested that adding the GenFilter to the generation workflow does obtain the expected result of only selecting events with GenPhotons.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

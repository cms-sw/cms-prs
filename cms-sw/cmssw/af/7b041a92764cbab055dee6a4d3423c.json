It was necessary because some tracking features (related to mostly \"SeedingLayerSetsBuilder\" class) were available only from 10X onwards. And so this commit is a way around those missing features, serving the same functionality overall.", "branch": "CMSSW_9_4_X", "changed_files": 43, "closed_at": "1538072521", "comments": 34, "commits": 29, "created_at": "1537598626", "deletions": 113, "labels": ["backport-ok", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fastsim-approved", "operations-pending", "orp-approved", "pdmv-approved", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "44925caf0024775da7ff06ee7ba44181fb680551", "merged_at": "1538072521", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_4_X", "number": 24624, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 6, "state": "closed", "title": "Backport of Phase1 Tracking in FastSim to 94X", "updated_at": "1538072521", "user": "angirar"}

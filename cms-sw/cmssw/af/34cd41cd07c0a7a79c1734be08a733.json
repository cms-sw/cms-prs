It features\n- simple plugin-based interface to produce reconstructed hits\n- plugins can be restricted to certain DetIds\n- hits can be merged if SimHits are too close\n\nFor comparisons, the old producer can still be used but will be removed in the future. Currently, merging of hits is still deactivated. This will be changed in a later PR.\n\nRelated presentations from the 2nd FastSim days (https://indico.cern.ch/event/473392/):\n- https://indico.cern.ch/event/473392/contributions/1994037/attachments/1229086/1800822/2016_02_16.pdf\n- https://indico.cern.ch/event/473392/contributions/1994039/attachments/1229120/1801774/fastsim_alicecocoros.pdf\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 50, "closed_at": "1468043940", "comments": 34, "commits": 129, "created_at": "1465568072", "deletions": 2489, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "core-approved", "fastsim-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "tests-started"], "merge_commit_sha": "03041ec90c909bfba69dd7fd412f273235947b61", "merged_at": "1468043940", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 14843, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 19, "state": "closed", "title": "New FastSim Hit Reconstruction Emulation", "updated_at": "1468043940", "user": "matt-komm"}

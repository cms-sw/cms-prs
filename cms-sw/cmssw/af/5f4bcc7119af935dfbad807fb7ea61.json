This is currently only supported for the Stage-2 Era.\n\nThe intention is that the new features (supporting Stage-2 configuration via Eras) will not disrupt the legacy and 2015 RelVals, and recent successful tests indicate this is indeed working.\n\nSince it is not yet included in any rel vals, a simple test of the new L1REPACK feature is to run:\n`cmsDriver.py RepackTest -s L1REPACK:Full,RAW2DIGI --era=Run2_2016 --conditions=auto:run2_data -n 10 --data --filein=/store/data/Run2015D/ZeroBias/RAW/v1/000/260/627/00000/00A76FFA-0C82-E511-B441-02163E01450F.root --no_output --customise=L1Trigger/Configuration/customiseUtils.L1TStage2DigisSummary`\nwhich L1REPACK's followed by vanilla RAW2DIGI and a screen dump of the Stage-2 output.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 45, "closed_at": "1455532040", "comments": 50, "commits": 18, "created_at": "1455308169", "deletions": 1215, "labels": ["comparison-available", "l1-approved", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "0528e62d676d23b1bee6bbcb4faa044a66731973", "merged_at": "1455532040", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 13271, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 16, "state": "closed", "title": "Update Standard Sequences for L1T in 2016", "updated_at": "1455692077", "user": "mulhearn"}

That change is being  backed out and the specification file of DataFormats/Provenance is being resynched with the ROOT5 branch before updating for ROOT6.\nPlease merge this request as soon as convenient.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_ROOT6_X", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": "1418836862", "comments": 0, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1418836753", "deletions": 62, "labels": [], "merge_commit_sha": "a267b951bf6d4e1b7aa9773dbc3d1cdbbc72d55f", "merged_at": "1418836862", "merged_by": "davidlt", "number": 6961, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix checksums in framework", "updated_at": "1418836922", "user": "wmtan"}

I have no idea why this compiled before, because I can't find any relevant using directives or declarations.  So, this pull request adds any missing \"std::\" namespace qualifiers to instances of ifstream, vector, string, cout, endl, etc. that I could find in IOPool/Streamer.\nIn a couple of places, I also took multiple statements on the same line and put them on separate lines. \n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1378895232", "comments": 4, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1378844005", "deletions": 21, "labels": ["core-approved", "fully-signed"], "merge_commit_sha": "7701d8eff4d9866a2b1b8cccb37f707eb7fe3dde", "merged_at": "1378895232", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_0_0_pre4", "number": 771, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "add missing std:: namespace qualifiers", "updated_at": "1406901580", "user": "wmtan"}

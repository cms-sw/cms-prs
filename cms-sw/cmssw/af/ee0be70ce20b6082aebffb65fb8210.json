The schema for the campaign should be the following:\r\n\r\n#### 2022 campaign\r\n- GEN-SIM-RAW-DIGI steps run in `14_0_X`;\r\n- HLT step for 2022 run in `12_4_X`;\r\n- all the subsequent step run in `14_0_X`;\r\n- ideal pre EE issue conditions. The EE issue to be mimicked via a veto.\r\n\r\n#### 2023 campaign\r\n- GEN-SIM-RAW-DIGI steps run in `14_0_X`;\r\n- HLT step for 2023 run in `13_0_X`;\r\n- all the subsequent step run in `14_0_X`;\r\n- ideal pre BPix hole conditions. The BPix issue to be absorbed in the SF.\r\n\r\nThis setup poses some issues:\r\n- forward compatibility: CMSSW does not formally support it so `12_4_X` or `13_0_X` being able to process `14_0_X` samples is not granted. \r\n- conditions: we need to be able to have exactly the same conditions for [`140X_*preEE*` and `124X_*preEE*`] and [`140X_*preBPix*` and `130X_*preBPix*`]. Possibly having the `SimBeamSpotObjectsRcd` in them, to be able to use the BS smearing from GT mechanism at GEN-SIM step.\r\n\r\nTo make it less cumbersome (hopefully), I've split each step in a different script and have the different setups running the same bash script with different inputs. **As they are, none of the tests technically fails**. This is intentional not to have some tests that will by definition break any IB. But any suggestion there is welcome. Each script setup a working area in the `/tmp` folder, runs the HLT step in a specific target release and all the steps in the current release. \r\n\r\n_Issue (?): as they are these tests take O(100s) each (so x4)._ \r\n\r\nWe would need a back port to `14_0_X` to have it tested there.\r\n\r\nFYI: @cms-sw/alca-l2, @cms-sw/core-l2 ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "comments": 49, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1711721299", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["core-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 44578, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 24, "state": "open", "title": "Scripts to Test MC 22-23 Production (UL-like) in IBs", "updated_at": "1712596505", "user": "AdrianoDee"}

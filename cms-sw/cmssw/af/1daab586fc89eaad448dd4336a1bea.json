Could not retrieve algo bit number.\r\n```\r\nwhich can be avoided by propagating, via modifier, to 2025 workflows the same fix that was already applied to 2024 ones.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI expect those warning messages disappear in the 2025 logs \r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nIt can be backported to CMSSW_15_0_X, in case one wants to silence those warning also in the 2025 data taking and MC production releases", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1746471109", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "hold", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 48016, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Remove L1_ETT1600 also from the 2025 list, not only from the 2024 one, in DQM/L1TMonitor", "updated_at": "1746501884", "user": "perrotta"}

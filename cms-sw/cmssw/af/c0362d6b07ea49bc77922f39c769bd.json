This is clearly not invertible.\n\nMaybe in the long run there should be a change in logic of the algorithm.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1467741340", "comments": 8, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1467122018", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "67d4b4b23dbdb48b9eba1a8dfd730bd8aa368779", "merged_at": "1467741340", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 15017, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "suppress LogError for somewhat clearly bad input of TrajectoryStateCombiner (backport of #15016)", "updated_at": "1467741340", "user": "slava77"}

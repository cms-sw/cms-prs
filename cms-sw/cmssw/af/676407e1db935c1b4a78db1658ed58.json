It temporarily removes L1 monitoring until the new database tables are in place and reports the rates of all L1 tech and algo bits to be 0 (as requested by the DAQ group so as not to have to modify their scripts). The L1 physics/calibration/random value is taken from the event just as before. The prescale index and HLT paths and datasets should all be correct.\n\nThis PR is identical to #13586 (the latter was submitted to CMSSW_8_0_0_patchX instead of CMSSW_8_0_X).\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1457451601", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1457040931", "deletions": 48, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "hlt-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "eddc70e4d256ba4f572412587bc2de6d069defdc", "merged_at": "1457451601", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 13588, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Adapting JSON monitoring to L1 Stage 2 (80X version)", "updated_at": "1457451602", "user": "avetisya"}

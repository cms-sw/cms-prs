This pull request fixes that unit test to not use the removed header, thereby fixing what would otherwise be a build error.  The unit test still passes with this change.\nPlease merge as soon as convenient, if possible in time for the next IB.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_ROOT6_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1418235410", "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1418229610", "deletions": 10, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "db-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "2cbca0f6d5d5a2a0238a8f8cca889d355ed285f1", "merged_at": "1418235410", "merged_by": "ktf", "number": 6867, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Don't use removed header", "updated_at": "1418331598", "user": "wmtan"}

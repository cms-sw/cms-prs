HI have requested this be fixed retrospectively in the GT (to be followed up with AlCa).\r\n\r\nWith this fix, future L1TCalo o2o'd payloads will contain the correct values for parameters divided by 2 that take odd numbers in the HW key. \r\n\r\nNo backport required. \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1701882448", "deletions": 11, "labels": ["l1-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "number": 43510, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "L1T o2o: fix int/2 bug", "updated_at": "1701883424", "user": "bundocka"}

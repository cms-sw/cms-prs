The sizes in the definitions of the digi tables already contain the variables but the for loops that fill those tables has hardcoded numbers instead of variables. This is a fix to make the nTS modification from the configuration script to work properly. This change was originally done locally by Alexi Mestvirishvili.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI ran the script in https://gitlab.cern.ch/cmshcal/hcalpfg/hcalnanoprod/-/blob/main/test/globalrun_cfg.py with default inputs and the output file had 3 time slices for HF, as expected. I also ran the script in https://gitlab.cern.ch/cmshcal/hcalpfg/hcalnanoprod/-/blob/main/test/localrun_cfg.py the same way. I edited the line: process.hcalDigiSortedTable.nTS_HF = cms.untracked.uint32(x) with x=6, 8 and 12. The output files from these instances were created with 6, 8 and 12 time slices for HF, respectively.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1720469036", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending", "xpog-pending", "hcal"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 45406, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Make nTS loops configurable", "updated_at": "1720469058", "user": "kaderci-johannes"}

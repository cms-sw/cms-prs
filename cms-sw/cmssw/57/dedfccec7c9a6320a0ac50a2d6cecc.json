The adjustment explicitly sets the `auxi1` and `auxi2` `HcalTPChannelParameter` fields to match those currently used for Run3 Era to configure/use the OOT-PU-subtracting, prefire-vetoing trigger primitive algorithm used in HB and HE. The current HB TP algorithm being configured in Phase2 workflows is the now-legacy Run2/Run1 algorithm, which is not envisioned to be returned to in Phase2.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the pulse containment correction \"fix\" is toggled on for the Phase2 Era, as it impacts HB TPs.\r\n\r\nChanges **_are_** expected for Phase2 workflows for HB trigger primitives.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

To ensure the time distribution is sampled within 25 ns window, a delay on the global time is added depending on the sub-detector equal to: EE=-9 ns, HEfront=-11 ns, HEback=-14 ns and HFNose=-33 ns.\r\n\r\nThese time delays are checked in the following plot:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14130873/195450762-9ea91d3d-dfa3-4842-978b-0c4c4ec3e148.png)\r\n\r\nThe ToA definition is not changed at RECO level, thus the time of reconstructed HGCAL clusters and tracksters is still the time back-propagated to the center (as currently used), to simplify the review of the DIGI changes. The uncalibrated rechit algorithm takes care of the  back-propagation and the removal of the time delay.\r\n\r\nThis is part of the set of updates already announced in the HGCAL DPG meeting (see https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11AHfmXCauuNehVb7wZkH5JLHSSI_rbgjducatd0IJwU/edit?usp=sharing).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nPR was validated using the following cmsDriver command:\r\ncmsDriver.py TTbar_14TeV_TuneCP5_cfi --conditions auto:phase2_realistic_T21 -n 10 --era Phase2C18I13M9 --eventcontent FEVTDEBUG -s GEN,SIM,DIGI --datatier GEN-SIM-DIGI --beamspot HLLHC14TeV --geometry Extended2026D94 --fileout file:step12_HF.root --customise SLHCUpgradeSimulations/Configuration/aging.customise_aging_3000\r\n\r\nThe expected changes include:\r\n- Minor variations of all CMS digis due to change in number of calls to random number generator engine (correlated per event across all CMSSW).\r\n- Simulated HGCAL toa time distribution lowered to 1ns (instead of 5 ns).\r\n- Rec hit time distribution peaking at around 0 ns (before was offset to 5 ns).\r\n\r\n@pfs @rovere @felicepantaleo ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 15, "comments": 29, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1665603712", "deletions": 117, "labels": ["hlt-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "upgrade-approved", "code-checks-approved", "hgcal-dpg-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_6_X", "number": 39720, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 12, "state": "open", "title": "HGCAL: Change ToA to global time in DIGI", "updated_at": "1666132620", "user": "stahlleiton"}

EMTF will be loading new PC LUTs reflecting the real CMS geometry, and thus new LUTs and modifications to the emulator are needed to preserve data-emulator agreement.\r\n\r\nThe new LUTs have been PR-ed separately here: cms-l1t-offline/L1Trigger-L1TMuon#9\r\n\r\nThis is a \"forward port\" of a PR to 10_2_X which was made a week ago, since the Online DQM is built on 10_2_5: https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/24617  This PR is already running at P5 and shows good data-emulator agreement.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nAndrew and @jiafulow for the EMTF team\r\n\r\n[1] https://indico.cern.ch/event/758694/contributions/3146645/subcontributions/263903/attachments/1719883/2776101/2018_09_20_EMTF_alignment.pdf", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 10, "closed_at": "1539237414", "comments": 13, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1538379721", "deletions": 65, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "575c93929e81af13e6b34f190d6b6c4686a40155", "merged_at": "1539237414", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_4_X", "number": 24766, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "EMTF new LCT coordinate conversion LUTs", "updated_at": "1539237414", "user": "abrinke1"}

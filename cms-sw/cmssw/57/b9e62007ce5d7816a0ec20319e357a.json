EMTF will be loading new PC LUTs reflecting the real CMS geometry, and thus new LUTs and modifications to the emulator are needed to preserve data-emulator agreement.\r\n\r\nThe new LUTs have been PR-ed separately here: cms-l1t-offline/L1Trigger-L1TMuon#9\r\n\r\nThis is a \"forward port\" of a PR to 10_2_X which was made a week ago, since the Online DQM is built on 10_2_5: https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/24617  This PR is already running at P5 and shows good data-emulator agreement.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nAndrew and @jiafulow for the EMTF team\r\n\r\n[1] https://indico.cern.ch/event/758694/contributions/3146645/subcontributions/263903/attachments/1719883/2776101/2018_09_20_EMTF_alignment.pdf", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 10, "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1538379721", "deletions": 65, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "l1-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-started"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_3_X", "number": 24766, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "EMTF new LCT coordinate conversion LUTs", "updated_at": "1538380255", "user": "abrinke1"}

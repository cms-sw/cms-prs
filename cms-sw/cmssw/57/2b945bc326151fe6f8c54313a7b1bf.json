The tags with the 2018 JEC exist and should be uploaded very soon (tomorrow?).\r\n\r\nThis PR is a backport of #30478, which should have been prepared in July along with the original PR. This backport PR does not update the JEC for Run 3 scenarios to avoid unnecessary changes.\r\n\r\nIn addition, there is a correction to the tags for 2018 GTs that will be propagated to master in the next few days with the updated 2018 JEC. For example, in `112X_upgrade2018_realistic_v4`, the `JetResolutionRcd` with label `AK8PFchs_phi` currently uses the tag `JR_Autumn18_V7b_MC_PtResolution_AK8PFchs` (a Pt resolution tag) rather than `JR_Autumn18_V7b_MC_PhiResolution_AK8PFchs`.\r\n\r\nThe change of HLT JEC in the 2017 cosmics GTs is a purely technical change associated with an incorrectly assigned synchronization; the payload hashes for the two tags are identical. Of course, the HLT JEC are not relevant for the cosmic GT in any case.\r\n\r\nThe GT diffs for this PR are as follows:\r\n\r\n**Offline data**\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/106X_dataRun2_v29/106X_dataRun2_v30\r\n\r\n**Offline data relval**\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/106X_dataRun2_relval_v27/106X_dataRun2_relval_v28\r\n\r\n**2017 realistic**\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/106X_mc2017_realistic_v7/106X_mc2017_realistic_v8\r\n\r\n**2017 realistic cosmics (tracker deco mode)**\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/106X_mc2017cosmics_realistic_deco_v2/106X_mc2017cosmics_realistic_deco_v3\r\n\r\n**2017 realistic cosmics (tracker peak mode)**\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/106X_mc2017cosmics_realistic_peak_v2/106X_mc2017cosmics_realistic_peak_v3\r\n\r\n**2018 realistic**\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/106X_upgrade2018_realistic_v11/106X_upgrade2018_realistic_v12\r\n\r\n**2018 realistic (HEM15/16 failure)**\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/106X_upgrade2018_realistic_HEfail_v11/106X_upgrade2018_realistic_HEfail_v12\r\n\r\n**2018 cosmics (tracker deco mode)**\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/106X_upgrade2018cosmics_realistic_deco_v9/106X_upgrade2018cosmics_realistic_deco_v10\r\n\r\n**2018 cosmics (tracker peak mode)**\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/106X_upgrade2018cosmics_realistic_peak_v9/106X_upgrade2018cosmics_realistic_peak_v10\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nPlease see PR #30478 for details of the validation.

It would aid development to have these separate from CommonTools/ParticleFlow (which is focused on the \"top projection\" code).\nThe current output is set up as an intermediate stage where PFCandidates are produced along with a valueMap of four vectors. This is a stand-in until I make a migration to the ThinnedCollection, but this is better treated together rather than piecemeal.\n\nAlso adding @violatingcp and @nhanvtran to watch this.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_3_X", "changed_files": 34, "closed_at": "1416728413", "comments": 15, "commits": 18, "created_at": "1416587377", "deletions": 70, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "new-package-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "82f073291d606a3319c1e7031dc163449080641b", "merged_at": "1416728413", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_3_X", "number": 6542, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "JME 73x : Add new PU mitigation algos, update to new fastjetcontrib API, Rebase of 6496", "updated_at": "1429721114", "user": "rappoccio"}

This pull request adds them.\n\nThe file in FastSimulation looks like it was totally modified, but that is just because it was formerly in DOS format.  The only change was changing ifstream to std::ifstream in one place.\n\nIt would be very helpful to the ROOT6 effort if this request was merged in a timely manner.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 16, "closed_at": "1379018372", "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1379016159", "deletions": 885, "labels": ["alca-pending", "dqm-pending", "fastsim-pending", "l1-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "a88dfed4e975471e05e6c4bd6a86f7a75104be51", "merged_at": "1379018372", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_0_0_pre4", "number": 816, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "add missing namespaces or includes", "updated_at": "1406901660", "user": "wmtan"}

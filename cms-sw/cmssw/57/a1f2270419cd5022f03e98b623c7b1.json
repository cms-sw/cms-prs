This PR fixes few divide by 0 in DAClusterizerInZ_vect.cc to avoid generating nan.\r\n\r\nThe proposal is to check for finiteness (with `edm::isFinite` due to https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/45528#issuecomment-2276108018) for the denominator of a series of ratios exploding to NaN.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1723546523", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-rejected", "tracking"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 45693, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Fix NaNs From 0 Divisions in `DAClusterizerInZ_vect.cc`", "updated_at": "1723546796", "user": "AdrianoDee"}

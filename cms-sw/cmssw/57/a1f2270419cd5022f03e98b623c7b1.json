This PR fixes few divide by 0 in DAClusterizerInZ_vect.cc to avoid generating nan.\r\n\r\nThe proposal is to check for finiteness (with `edm::isFinite` due to https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/45528#issuecomment-2276108018) for the denominator of a series of ratios exploding to NaN.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1723573452", "comments": 10, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1723546523", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved", "tracking"], "merge_commit_sha": "aac345505f2839d72ac5a0428b43409c96ff72ce", "merged_at": "1723573452", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 45693, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix NaNs From 0 Divisions in `DAClusterizerInZ_vect.cc`", "updated_at": "1723573453", "user": "AdrianoDee"}

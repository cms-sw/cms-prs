This resets those positions correctly, and updates the lengths of each volume. This time I checked for overlaps using the Fireworks overlap tool (Thanks, Yana) and this time there are no overlaps dues to my changes.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1394530794", "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1394465048", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "ae94093cbaa7825fe5acdf6576321ed6c4b485c6", "merged_at": "1394530794", "merged_by": "nclopezo", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_1_0_pre5", "number": 2795, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "fix mistaken dims & pos of me11 gas vols", "updated_at": "1394530794", "user": "ptcox"}

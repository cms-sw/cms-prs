It makes it easier to read. Originally, the changes were in that PR, but I realized they had nothing to do with concurrent runs so I separated the changes.) \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis shouldn't affect anything. Existing tests pass.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "comments": 6, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1652815165", "deletions": 50, "labels": ["core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-rejected", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 37991, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "A little code cleanup in DataFormats/Provenance", "updated_at": "1652871520", "user": "wddgit"}

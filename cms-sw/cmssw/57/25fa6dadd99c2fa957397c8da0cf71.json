It makes it easier to read. Originally, the changes were in that PR, but I realized they had nothing to do with concurrent runs so I separated the changes.) \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis shouldn't affect anything. Existing tests pass.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1652873842", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1652815165", "deletions": 50, "labels": ["core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-rejected", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "03170134a3dfe69baa46501a47ab6ec679f41f3a", "merged_at": "1652873842", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 37991, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "A little code cleanup in DataFormats/Provenance", "updated_at": "1652873842", "user": "wddgit"}

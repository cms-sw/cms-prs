The test is based on a trivial MonteCarlo estimate of the fraction of random points contained into the pixels. This update provides just output on the STDOUT for visual inspection and does nto affect the content of the file used for comparisons in the unit test procedure. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe code has been used in the investigation of the track-hit matching efficiency in ETL, helping to understand issues with the pixel definition.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1694438727", "comments": 11, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1694156631", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["geometry-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "upgrade-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "d6ec86c8a079550de27416d2c023622d500c1c83", "merged_at": "1694438727", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_13_3_X", "number": 42739, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "MTD geometry: add test for pixel acceptance in module", "updated_at": "1694438727", "user": "fabiocos"}

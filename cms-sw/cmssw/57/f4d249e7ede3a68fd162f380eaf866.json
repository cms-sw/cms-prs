Two packages outside the framework are minimally affected.\nOther minor C++ improvements were made in a very few files that were modified anyway.\nThere are three places in the framework where use of std::auto_ptr remains in place for now, because\nmany packages outside the framework would have been affected. These are:\na) The put() interface, for Event, Run, and LuminosityBlock.\nb) The interface to the EventSetup system\nc) The use of OwnVector\nThese still support both auto_ptr and unique_ptr for now, and will be migrated solely to unique_ptr at a later time, if time permits.\nAlso, this PR adds the use of std::make_unique everywhere in the framework where it does not cause complications.\nUnrelated to the above, I also fixed a few statements that had an extra semicolon at the end.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 207, "closed_at": "1459190667", "comments": 14, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1458759810", "deletions": 948, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-available", "core-approved", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-rejected"], "merge_commit_sha": "50a3872053bf12f06b295055e2e83256ea16660c", "merged_at": "1459190667", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 13820, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 20, "state": "closed", "title": "Use unique_ptr, not auto_ptr", "updated_at": "1464230232", "user": "wmtan"}

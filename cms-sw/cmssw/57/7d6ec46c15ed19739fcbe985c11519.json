This means that a const member function of the class will no longer be able to modify the data to which the pointer points. This PR is therefore a partial implementation of issue #12840. The member pointers in the framework that are not modified by this PR are:\n1) Those in FWLite (will be done in a separate PR).\n2) Pointers to const or pointers already declared mutable (no need to modify).\n3) Those pointers whose modifications require changes that were too extensive or complex to be done in this PR. These will be dealt within a case by case basis.\nOther minor changes made in a very few places in affected code:\na) a few boost::scoped_ptr changed to std::unique_ptr\nb) a few std::auto_ptr changed to std::unique_ptr\nc) iterator loops replaced by range based for loops\nd) nullptr replaces 0 for pointers\n\nThis PR does not change any instances of boost::shared_ptr to std::shared_ptr, because most of these have already been changed in previous PR's, and the ones remaining are not trivial to change. These will be changed in subsequent PR's where feasible.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 199, "closed_at": "1454054600", "comments": 20, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1453914703", "deletions": 792, "labels": ["comparison-available", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "tests-rejected"], "merge_commit_sha": "be33cc6a310ef172972cbc00a93a7952590ef220", "merged_at": "1454054600", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 13093, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 38, "state": "closed", "title": "Implement propagate_const in the framework", "updated_at": "1454699981", "user": "wmtan"}

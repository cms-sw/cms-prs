Simplifications of dictionaries because variadic templates are not necessary anymore\r\n2.  Code simplifications because BlocksView holds views to all sublayouts\r\n\r\nIn a future PRs the code can be simplified even more because with kernels that use a BlocksView as input can work on the entire data. Hence, it is not necessarry anymore to have every sub-view as input. In this PR, however, I tried to make as few changes as possible to not blow up the PR too much.\r\n\r\n**If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

They are intended to be used on 2016 data. This new photon MVA uses CITK-based isolation calculation that caused several minor changes in EGM sequences that go outside of the new IDs themselves. This PR contains extra adjustments for using Tasks recently introduced in the framework rather than Sequences, although all old Sequences are kept as well for backward compatibility.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 16, "closed_at": "1494345967", "comments": 20, "commits": 30, "created_at": "1492035867", "deletions": 69, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_9_2_X", "number": 18348, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 4, "state": "closed", "title": "EGM-certified photon IDs for 2016 data: cut based and MVA", "updated_at": "1494345967", "user": "ikrav"}

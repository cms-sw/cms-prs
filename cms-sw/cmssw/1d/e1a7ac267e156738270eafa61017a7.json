To avoid the overlaps, the Rail3 volumes have been moved out radially by 100 m.\r\n\r\nThe updated geometry has been tested with:\r\ng4OverlapCheck2026DD4hep_cfg.py geometry=D96 tol=0.01\r\nNo overlaps have been detected.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 6, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1675776788", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["geometry-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-approved", "mtd"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "number": 40715, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "BTL geometry: fixed overlaps", "updated_at": "1675836523", "user": "casarsa"}

Previous checks had been done at 100-m tolerance. \r\n(@fabiocos @bsunanda @civanch) \r\n\r\nDuring checks for PR #40704, a small overlap between the top bar of the BTL rails and the tray volumes was found. To avoid the overlaps, the Rail3 volumes have been moved out radially by 100 m.\r\n\r\nThe updated geometry has been tested with:\r\ng4OverlapCheck2026DD4hep_cfg.py geometry=D96 tol=0.01\r\nNo overlaps have been detected.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1675926094", "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1675776788", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["geometry-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "upgrade-approved", "code-checks-approved", "mtd"], "merge_commit_sha": "96bea4a4b36f0c818660212332d8b06e8ec0b600", "merged_at": "1675926094", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "number": 40715, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "BTL geometry: fixed overlaps", "updated_at": "1675926095", "user": "casarsa"}

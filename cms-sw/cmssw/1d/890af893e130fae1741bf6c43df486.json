It clusters the final LHE particles using the anti-kt jet algorithm. A cut on the minimum pT > 350 GeV is selected. This filter is a loose pre-selection of the AK8-jet pT > 650 GeV filter at particle level used in the production of TT_AK8HT650* samples. The pre-filter selects at LHE level 99.8% of the events with a jet of pT > 650 GeV at particle level, while only 3% of the inclusive ttbar sample passes the filter. Therefore, the number of events that have to be showered before the filter decision is drastically reduced.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTests have shown that this pre-filter reduces the the run time per event from ~1.3s to ~0.2s.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 730, "closed_at": "1566300530", "comments": 6, "commits": 902, "created_at": "1566223548", "deletions": 9829, "labels": ["alca-pending", "analysis-pending", "code-checks-rejected", "comparison-pending", "core-pending", "daq-pending", "db-pending", "dqm-pending", "fastsim-pending", "generators-pending", "geometry-pending", "hlt-pending", "l1-pending", "new-package-pending", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending", "upgrade-pending", "visualization-pending", "xpog-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27795, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Toplhefilter", "updated_at": "1566300530", "user": "ohindrichs"}

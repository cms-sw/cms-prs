In this PR all 3 PPS SDs are updated:\r\n  1. No more run time checks on physics volumes names, because geometry is fixed and depth in geometry structures is also fixed (all other sub-detectors do not use names in run time).\r\n  2. Corrected signatures of methods: which are public/private/protected according to the base class.\r\n  3. Removed unused methods and variables.\r\n  4. Renamed variables to follow code guidelines.\r\n  5. Make all 3 SD classes uniform.\r\n  6. Check energy deposition at a step and any run time processing is performed only if it is above zero.\r\n  7. Improved debug printouts. \r\n  8. Removed obsolete classes.\r\n\r\nNo change is expected in testing.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nprivate\r\n\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR: \r\n\r\nno backport is expected\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 16, "closed_at": "1651660918", "comments": 22, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1650556768", "deletions": 687, "labels": ["simulation-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "f2e7577571b5f10342ae57f1b538c593ea6aa804", "merged_at": "1651660918", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 37648, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "PPS Geant4 sensitive detectors", "updated_at": "1651660918", "user": "civanch"}

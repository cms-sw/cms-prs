The MCTruth package has a lot of code which has not been adapted to the consumes interface, so I have just copied the PSimHitMap class that MuonCSCDigis needs into MuonCSCDigis and  then adapted it with the consumes interface. MuonCSCDigis still compiles and builds. But not properly tested - I am just trying to keep this package alive for potential future use. On the positive side this removes a dependence on the MCTruth package. \n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "changed_files": 10, "closed_at": "1397732985", "comments": 21, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1397479763", "deletions": 13, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_7_1_0_pre7", "number": 3327, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Finish consumes for Validation/MuonCSCDigis", "updated_at": "1397732985", "user": "ptcox"}

Special code for this case has been added.\n\nI believe the special case is missed because the circular dependency checker\nonly finds 'base cycles' and not all cycles in the graph. The full cycles\nalways contain the 'back edge' for a 'base cycle'. However, in this particular\ncase the base cycle in question is determined (correctly) to be a false positive.\nIt is only one of the full cylces containing that same 'back edge' which\nactually has an unrunnable schedule.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_DEVEL_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1475091591", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1475083252", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-rejected"], "merge_commit_sha": "eb3441fe9e04dccfeefbfcfe3a91fee6a045c11c", "merged_at": "1475091591", "merged_by": "smuzaffar", "number": 16017, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Extend the unrunnable schedule checker for a case being missed", "updated_at": "1478674912", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

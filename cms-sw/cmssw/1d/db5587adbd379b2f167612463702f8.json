The only requirement for these tracks is that they have at least 4 hits (that covers T5s with a potential loss of a layer during fitting). The latter requirement is configurable.\r\nb) Passthrough for all tracks. No requirement is applied on the tracks. This is exploited in the single iteration configurations running LST seeding, as these configurations have a very low fake+duplicate. Running the high purity module unifies the configuration and enables the correct usage in downstream objects, in case they require tracks with high purity ID.\r\n\r\nThe above updates enable a large simplification of the HLT tracking configurations, which is done also in this PR. Below, the relevant procModifier combinations have been validated. The current configuration is in blue and the configuration proposed in this PR is in red:\r\n\r\n1. `trackingLST`, falling under option a) above\r\n<img width=\"1317\" height=\"734\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f776034c-8403-442e-aab7-5e9be101f421\" />\r\n\r\n2. `trackingLST,seedingLST`, falling under option a) above\r\n<img width=\"1317\" height=\"732\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3bac2841-fabf-4eef-808e-b1e5dbdd6988\" />\r\n\r\n3. `singleIterPatatrack,phase2CAExtension,trackingLST`, falling under option a) above\r\n<img width=\"1317\" height=\"732\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/314b193f-793b-4f76-bb0f-ac1a1b2c3112\" />\r\n\r\n4. `singleIterPatatrack,phase2CAExtension,trackingLST,seedingLST`, falling under option b) above\r\n<img width=\"1317\" height=\"732\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2feb128c-2911-4dfc-a225-4c2c9e1df016\" />\r\n\r\n5. `phase2CAExtension,singleIterPatatrack,trackingLST,seedingLST,trackingMkFitCommon,hltTrackingMkFitInitialStep`, falling under option b) above\r\n<img width=\"1317\" height=\"732\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/acd63eb9-1e36-4766-a6be-f53d65de4deb\" />\r\n\r\n### Comments on the physics perfomance:\r\n- Configurations 1, 2, 3 utilize the TrackListMerger module in a different way (cleaning tracks within the same collection instead of separate collections). This leads to a small increase of the efficiency and either some small decrease of fake rate (for the two iteration setup) or some increase of fake+duplicate rate (in the single iteration setup, where it still remains below 2.5% in any  range).\r\n- Configurations 4, 5 remain unchanged: before they were using built tracks in the general track collection, while they now use the high purity ID tracks, with the passthrough option enabled, in the general track collection, and these two configurations are fully equivalent.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 29, "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1763032976", "deletions": 191, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "dqm-pending", "hlt-pending", "operations-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending", "tracking"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_0_X", "number": 49382, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Update high purity ID and simplify HLT LST configurations", "updated_at": "1763033002", "user": "VourMa"}

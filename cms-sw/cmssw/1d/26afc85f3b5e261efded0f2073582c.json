This new plugin is, in a way, the counterpart of `EvFFEDSelector`, which instead requires the list of FEDs to keep.\r\n\r\nOne use case for this plugin is HIon's \"RawPrime\", which includes a `FEDRawDataCollection` without SiStrip FEDs (right now, an hard-coded list of \"all FEDs but the SiStrip ones\" is used in a `EvFFEDSelector`; it would arguably be better to have a `EvFFEDExcluder` with the list of SiStrip FEDs).\r\n\r\nThis was discussed in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/39863#discussion_r1006485795 and https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/39863#discussion_r1013955672.\r\n\r\nNames (e.g. \"excluder\") are tentative. I chose different names for the plugin's parameters with respect to `EvFFEDSelector` (`InputTag -> src`, `fedList -> fedsToExclude`) thinking that this reduces the chance of using `EvFFEDExcluder` instead of `EvFFEDSelector` (or viceversa) by mistake.\r\n\r\nA cfg file is added to `test/` for testing purposes (if not useful, it can be removed).\r\n\r\nNo changes expected, as this PR is basically insensitive to PR tests.\r\n\r\n_Note_ : no backports are planned. The intention is simply to add this new plugin for development purposes (could be useful in 2023).\r\n\r\nFYI: @mmusich\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nChecks based on `testEvFFEDSelectors.py`.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

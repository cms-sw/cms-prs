The update is highly related to previous PR https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/48398 i.e. here we introduce scouting egamma part into HLT Scouting DQM online client for the DQMOnlineScoutingstream. This progress has been mentioned in the [scouting meeting at 28 Aug 2025.](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1579341/contributions/6655674/subcontributions/568712/attachments/3124961/5542266/ScoutingEGamma_Report_DPNote_2025Aug28.pdf)\r\n\r\nThis is the backport of the approved PR for CMSSW_15_1_X: [cmssw#48850 Include scouting EGM in Online DQM stream](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/48850)\r\n\r\n#### Description of the current change\r\n\r\n- Add options useOfflineObject in the config files under the original `HLTriggerOffline/Scouting`. In online stream, we could choose not to use any offline object by such options.\r\n\r\n- Add EGM part to online stream config file accordingly.\r\n- **Note**: The current file `HLTriggerOffline/Scouting/python/HLTScoutingEGammaPostProcessing_cff.py`, which corresponds to the DQM Harvester, uses offline objects to achieve more accurate Tag-and-Probe measurements. Therefore, this postprocessor is not included in the online DQM sequence. (Similarly, in previous PR, for scouting muons, the harvester defined in `HLTriggerOffline/Scouting/python/ScoutingMuonMonitoring_Client_cff.py` is not used in Online DQM.) This is mentioned here for completeness.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nThis PR is prepared under `CMSSW_15_0_13_patch2`\r\n```\r\nscram project CMSSW_15_0_13_patch2\r\ncd CMSSW_15_0_13_patch2/src/\r\ncmsenv\r\ngit cms-rebase-topic --old-base  CMSSW_15_1_X_2025-08-27-2300 tihsu99:ScoutingOnlineDQM\r\nscram b && scram b code-checks && scram b code-format && scram b\r\n```\r\nand run with \r\n```\r\n runTheMatrix.py -l 145.314\r\n```\r\n\r\n[c.c. @mmusich @rseidita @silviodonato @patinkaew ]", "branch": "CMSSW_15_0_X", "changed_files": 7, "comments": 5, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1757425130", "deletions": 79, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "hlt-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "backport-ok"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_0_X", "number": 48878, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[BackPort CMSSW_15_0_X] Include scouting EGM in Online DQM stream ", "updated_at": "1757425874", "user": "tihsu99"}

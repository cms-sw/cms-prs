This PR joins 28626 and 28629 + the requirements discussed in them. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nBuilds for both cmsdist/master (production \"old\" geant) and cmsdist/geant4 (10.6 geant)\r\n\r\nThe previous two cmssw PRs discussion suggests to use int counters to avoid the original build error and from other concerns. This PR builds with both master of cmdist and geant4 branch (works with both geant versions)\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 15, "closed_at": "1576745842", "comments": 19, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1576580934", "deletions": 43, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "requires-external", "simulation-approved", "tests-started"], "merge_commit_sha": "fb33c6418678f84e1a3b60afaea203bdeae61aa0", "merged_at": "1576745842", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 28637, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "[Geant4] Code adjustment for new Geant4 version", "updated_at": "1576788619", "user": "mrodozov"}

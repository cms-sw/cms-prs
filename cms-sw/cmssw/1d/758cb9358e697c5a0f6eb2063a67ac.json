RECO and FEVT was never updated to keep  recoPFClusters_particleFlowClusterHF. \n  - this at some point affected  running recoMET_pfClusterMet_cfg.py in RecoMET/METProducers unit tests which was first mitigated in #10818  in the test itself (instead of adding clusters to RECO). The METProducers kept running thanks to rather inclusive fastsim event content \"keep *_particleFlow*_*_*\", until the fastsim event content was cleaned up in 80X in #13090 . \n  - A more appropriate fix is to keep HF PFClusters and not attempt to remake them in recoMET_pfClusterMet_cfg.py\n- Missing  recoPFClusters_particleFlowClusterHF in RECO was also reported by FSQ.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1455687610", "comments": 11, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1455651466", "deletions": 12, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "b3e064d1b3d0558a09ebe4a907808e20b1f70e39", "merged_at": "1455687610", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 13309, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "recover particleFlowClusterHF in event content", "updated_at": "1455687610", "user": "slava77"}

If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nNot a backport, we will decide on the final integration of this PR after seeing it in production.\r\n\r\n\r\nFYI @mmusich @gennai @dzuolo @sikler ", "branch": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1657119795", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 38618, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[Do Not Merge (yet)] Update errorScale for BeamSpot Legacy DQM client and change tag name", "updated_at": "1657119819", "user": "francescobrivio"}

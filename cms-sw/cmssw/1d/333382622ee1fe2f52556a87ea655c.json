For the moment they are a copy of what we run currently for 2024 with the idea that once 2025 parameters (conditions, HLT) come  we will simply need to fill the dummy ones (keeping them in sync one with the other). Here I add also:\r\n\r\n- `@relval2025` pointing to `GRun` as a copy of `@relval2024`;\r\n- `auto:phase1_2025_*` symbolic GTs;\r\n\r\nThe era is `Era_2025` that for now is simply a copy of `Era_2024`. A TTbar 2025 noPU wf is added to the limited matrix to be tested with PRs.\r\n\r\nThe rationale is that I would like to avoid (with some anticipation) that we fall again in a situation such as https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/44028 or https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/41410. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nNew wfs run.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 8, "comments": 38, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1729254277", "deletions": 47, "labels": ["hlt-pending", "alca-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "hold", "pdmv-pending", "tests-started", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_2_X", "number": 46445, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 16, "state": "open", "title": "2025 Wfs Skeleton", "updated_at": "1730064739", "user": "AdrianoDee"}

Currently, only the latter is being matched and used in the PPS offline reconstruction.\r\nAdditionally, a few `get` prefixes were stripped from the `TotemTimingConversions` accessors, in preparation for the future CMS coding conventions matchings to the PPS code (see #25690 and CTPPS#40).\r\n\r\nCurrently, the new payload has not been uploaded to the conditions DB, hence the test in `RecoCTPPS/TotemRPLocal/test/totemTiming_reco_cfg.py` has been adapted to use the JSON in the meantime. This behaviour will be adapted in a later review stage of this PR.\r\n\r\ncc: @nminafra", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 12, "comments": 18, "commits": 15, "created_at": "1549349190", "deletions": 297, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_5_X", "number": 25858, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "open", "title": "DB usage for Totem/PPS timing local reconstruction", "updated_at": "1549392629", "user": "forthommel"}

The file Trajectory.cc present at FastSimulation/SimplifiedGeometryPropagator/src featured an expression that puts a threshold beyond which the tracks were assumed straight(Huge Radius!). This expression was causing troubles for the high pT tracks beyond 1.2 TeV. I removed the condition and observed reconstructed pT in order with the simulated Gen pT. \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1713251027", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["fastsim-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 44748, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "High pT Tracks resolved: Fitting each track as a Helix!

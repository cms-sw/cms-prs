See PR #39804. Originally I proposed deleting these modules).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nNote that there are no unit tests or RelVal tests of these modules and nothing in CMSSW uses them that I am aware of besides the standalone test configurations also modified by this PR. Those test configurations did not work before the changes in this PR and will need some work on issues unrelated to JetCorrectors to execute successfully. There are some comments added in the test configurations indicating at least some of the problems that would need to be fixed. I did not address issues unrelated to JetCorrectors in this PR.\r\n\r\nI hacked around with this code and made temporary changes (commenting out parts) as a test to be able to see that the JetCorrector parts of it are parseable by Python and the JetCorrector producers execute (verified in Tracer output).\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 10, "comments": 0, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1669240684", "deletions": 28, "labels": ["alca-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_6_X", "number": 40139, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "JetCorrector migration in DiJetAnalyzer, GammaJetAnalysis", "updated_at": "1669240705", "user": "wddgit"}

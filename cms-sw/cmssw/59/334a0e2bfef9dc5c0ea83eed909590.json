It also slightly changes the ALCARECO workflow to be more DRY and have overlapping code for PCL and standalone calibration workflows.\n\nI also added several [unit tests](https://github.com/CMSTrackerDPG/cmssw/blob/newStripSW_v2/CalibTracker/SiStripCommon/test/run_tests.sh) to check in the IBs whether some upstream code changes may break our code and act promptly. Would it be possible to add this script to the jenkins stack?\n\nInterested people: @dimattia @jlagram\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 42, "closed_at": "1454501968", "comments": 29, "commits": 15, "created_at": "1453973840", "deletions": 1251, "labels": ["alca-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "8cc9000e1e72efee5fe884fd1c1bb255ac93a9a7", "merged_at": "1454501968", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 13101, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 4, "state": "closed", "title": "SiStrip Calibration common framework revamp", "updated_at": "1454501968", "user": "mverzett"}

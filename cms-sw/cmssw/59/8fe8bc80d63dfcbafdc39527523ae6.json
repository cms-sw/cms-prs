Any problems with either would show up in FE bend and stub width.\r\nChange range of stub bend to accommodate half- and quarter-integer values. Makes RelVal comparison easier since there are no more \"border cases,\" like 0.5, that could fall into two different bins.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nVerified the code compiles and runs successfully.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\nNot a backport.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1610633002", "comments": 8, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1610568701", "deletions": 33, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "eb134e644ee5255fc0656f1e4181bfca7203306e", "merged_at": "1610633002", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 32663, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "L1 Tk DQM, plot range", "updated_at": "1610633098", "user": "emacdonald16"}

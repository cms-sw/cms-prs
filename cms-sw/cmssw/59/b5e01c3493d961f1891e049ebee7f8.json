Increase by about  a strip width at each edge, so this is a small correction (about 2% increase in linear dimensions.)\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 86, "closed_at": "1391441088", "comments": 1, "commits": 32, "created_at": "1391440883", "deletions": 755, "labels": ["core-pending", "dqm-pending", "fastsim-pending", "generators-pending", "geometry-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_7_0_0", "number": 2274, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Increase me11 sensitive regions", "updated_at": "1391775697", "user": "ptcox"}

In ROOT 6, this causes unnecessary header parsing, which increases memory use.  It is also significantly slower, in ROOT 5 as well as ROOT 6.\nIt is easy to do this without introspection.\nThis pull request is for ROOT 6.  The same change will be done for ROOT 5 (in another pull request) for code commonality, unless it causes problems in ROOT 5.\nPlease merge this request as soon as convenient.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_3_ROOT6_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1414095607", "comments": 0, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1414095558", "deletions": 43, "labels": [], "merge_commit_sha": "ee3f83c7965508d29b1b52212f3709dcf600df85", "merged_at": "1414095607", "merged_by": "davidlt", "number": 5974, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Don't use introspection in MVAComputer", "updated_at": "1415108970", "user": "wmtan"}

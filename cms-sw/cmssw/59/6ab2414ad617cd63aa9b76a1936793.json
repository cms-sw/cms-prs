An update to the data GT will be necessary at some point in the future, prior to the re-miniAOD of the HI data, but we will wait until the release and strategy for that re-miniAOD is available prior to performing that update. This is the plan that was agreed upon with HI experts in the AlCaDB meeting of July 27, 2020.\r\n\r\nThe GT diffs are as follows:\r\n\r\n**2018 heavy ion**\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/112X_upgrade2018_realistic_HI_v1/112X_upgrade2018_realistic_HI_v2\r\n\r\n**2021 heavy ion**\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/112X_mcRun3_2021_realistic_HI_v5/112X_mcRun3_2021_realistic_HI_v6\r\n\r\nAttn: @mandrenguyen \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nPlease see the [presentations](https://indico.cern.ch/event/942206/#27-updated-2018-and-run-3-hi-c) at the July 27, 2020 AlCa/DB meeting for details of the validation.

E.g. `ticlTrackstersHFNoseEM` uses `EMn`.\r\nThis means that the uninitialized `TrackstersProducer::iterIndex_` is used to set the tracksters iteration. This leads to non-repeatable changes in this variable in the data outputs.\r\n\r\nThis PR sets the value to a somewhat inconvenient default of 0 to restore repeatable results in reco comparisons.\r\n\r\n Some better solution may be needed; to be done by some HGCAL experts \r\n@cms-sw/hgcal-dpg-l2 \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1629522399", "comments": 12, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1629457361", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "upgrade-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "8124e8c517fb4fe8b601a95b38d4857985157fed", "merged_at": "1629522399", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "number": 34962, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "initialize TrackstersProducer::iterIndex_ to 0", "updated_at": "1629522400", "user": "slava77"}

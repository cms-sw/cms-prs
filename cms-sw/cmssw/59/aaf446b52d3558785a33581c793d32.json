This doesn't test the full functionality as we don't have muon shower copies outside of a global run and currently there are no unpacked showers from EMTF, however no crashes etc. were observed so I think this could go in for further validation at P5 and once we have EMTF unpackers.\r\n\r\nattn: @vukasinmilosevic \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 8, "closed_at": "1644884736", "comments": 19, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1644513350", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "13b14e230d42841496e229f042f325b04bd00d3e", "merged_at": "1644884735", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 36928, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add muon shower comparison plots", "updated_at": "1644884736", "user": "dinyar"}

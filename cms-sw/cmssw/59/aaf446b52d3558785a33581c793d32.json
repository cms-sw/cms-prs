This doesn't test the full functionality as we don't have muon shower copies outside of a global run and currently there are no unpacked showers from EMTF, however no crashes etc. were observed so I think this could go in for further validation at P5 and once we have EMTF unpackers.\r\n\r\nattn: @vukasinmilosevic \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 8, "comments": 9, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1644513350", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 36928, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Add muon shower comparison plots", "updated_at": "1644693905", "user": "dinyar"}

The veto threshold is taken from the `auxi2` field of the `HcalTPChannelParameters` object for robust control of the veto threshold online and offline. \r\n\r\nSmall change in logic is incurred at L519 of HcalTrigPrimAlgo, where `check_sat` is now only defined by saturation in BX0 or BX1.\r\n\r\nN.B.: The veto thresholds have yet to be uploaded to the conditions database. So, the `overrideDBvetoThreshold` is set to `True` thereby keeping the veto disabled for now. A simple PR to flip the switch can be performed.\r\n\r\nATTN: @Michael-Krohn, @abdoulline, @jhakala\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

For the comparison, 100 events of 14TeV ttbar production have been reconstructed in the tilted geometry.\n\nNo changes expected for phase0/1.\n\n@VinInn @rovere @boudoul @delaere @kpedro88 for your information.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1472481494", "comments": 15, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1472135024", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved", "urgent"], "merge_commit_sha": "9571b5f380cf81c85106e95b0fc9ea0226e038c1", "merged_at": "1472481494", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 15608, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix ordering in Phase2OTEndcapRing", "updated_at": "1472481520", "user": "ebrondol"}

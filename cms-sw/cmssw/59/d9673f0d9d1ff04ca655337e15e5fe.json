Before this information was only available by calling `SoA::ParametersTypeOf_COLOMNNAME`. This means it was only available by name and it was not possible to iterate over this information.\r\n\r\nAlso at the moment the  `ConstDescriptor` and the `Descriptor`-struct hold colomn information wrapped in `std::span`, where for example the `scalar`-type information of `Eigen`-objects is extracted. This means it is not possible to get back to the original `Eigen`-object that is defined as `SOA_COLOMN`. The information like the number of rows can not be obtained in this way.\r\n\r\nTo the PR a SoA copy example is added as test case, which copies two smaller Collections to a larger one. The idea for the copy method, which unrolls the colomns of the SoA at compile time, is taken from [SiPixelRecHitExtendedAlpaka](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/RecoLocalTracker/SiPixelRecHits/plugins/alpaka/SiPixelRecHitExtendedAlpaka.cc)\r\n\r\nFYI @felicepantaleo @borzari ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 22, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1769784407", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "heterogeneous-approved", "tests-ib-failure", "ngt"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_1_X", "number": 49990, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 9, "state": "open", "title": "Extension of SoA Descriptors", "updated_at": "1770283274", "user": "Electricks94"}

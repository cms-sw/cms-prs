So it's copying some wrong portion of memory. This was noted in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/40604 and this solves it.\r\n\r\nThis fix is quick and dirty, given also this CUDA to legacy copy will be dropped soon.\r\n\r\nThis is a back-port to `13_0_X` of #40869. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRun 11634.59x.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1677223306", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "heterogeneous-pending", "tracking"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "number": 40870, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[13_0_X] Fix `cudaMemcpyAsync` for `localCoordToHostAsync`", "updated_at": "1677223327", "user": "AdrianoDee"}

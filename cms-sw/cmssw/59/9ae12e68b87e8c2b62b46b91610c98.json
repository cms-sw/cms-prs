This request replaces the last use of Reflex::CollFuncTable with the ROOT class TVirtualCollectionProxy.\n\nIt is not yet known whether the relvals will now pass, or fail on a later error.\n\nNOTE:  The changes to StlContainerHandler.\\* are much less extensive than they appear here.  This is because the files were also converted from DOS to UNIX format by removing the trailing carriage returns.  Using the \"-b\" flag with git diff will show the actual changes.\n\nPlease merge this before the next ROOT6 IB unless there are obvious problems.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_ROOT6_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1391034698", "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1391034084", "deletions": 1325, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "db-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "fca022de821acf0e32759b063aaca2408ee10005", "merged_at": "1391034698", "merged_by": "davidlt", "number": 2233, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Remove last use of Reflex::CollFuncTable", "updated_at": "1460378064", "user": "wmtan"}

This PR is to make a clear cut between production and relvals with DIGI and DIGI:pdigi_valid respectively. To run in production mode, we need to adapt `digitizers_cfi.py` to include Calo MCTruth for HGCAL in DIGI.\r\n\r\nNo change is expected for relvals as pdigi_valid will be used as before. The change is only the size of events in production mode. With PU200 ttbar, it can save more than 30MB/events as MergeTrackTruth will not be stored.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nGet proper cmsDriver(s) when use\r\n`runTheMatrix.py --what upgrade -l 23234.0,23234.21,23434.21,23434.9921 --dryRun`\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\nNot a backport, and no need for backport", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1622428599", "comments": 22, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1622026711", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "pdmv-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "f77cffe5dc0b190c55e4cd92ba64056c2f573849", "merged_at": "1622428599", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "number": 33847, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 4, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix prodlike workflow to use DIGI instead of DIGI:pdigi_valid", "updated_at": "1622428600", "user": "srimanob"}

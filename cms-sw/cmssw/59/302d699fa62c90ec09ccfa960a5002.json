The cuts mimic the one we already have. And in order to test this the `*.406` Alpaka PixelOnly triplets wf is added to test it. This could be useful for the 14 FPix1 module failures. \r\n\r\nLeaving it has a draft for the moment. \r\n\r\nIf this connection is not needed I would at least introduce the new wf removing the changes to the topology.\r\n\r\nThe 14_0_X backport is in #45479. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested with `runTheMatrix.py -w upgrade -l 12834.406 `", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 10, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1721201895", "deletions": 11, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "hlt-pending", "geometry-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-rejected", "tracking"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 45478, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 14, "state": "open", "title": "Allowing Jumping BPix2->FPix2 For Pixel Doublets (and Alpaka Pixel Triplets `*.406` wf)", "updated_at": "1724739016", "user": "AdrianoDee"}

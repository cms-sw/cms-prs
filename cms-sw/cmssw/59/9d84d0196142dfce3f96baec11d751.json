However, Config.py does not actually use anything in Utilities.py, so the circular dependency is bogus, and removing one import statement removes the circular dependency.\nI wasted a lot of time figuring this out, because I assumed that \"Utilities\" should be the lowest level package given its name. I suggest that Utilities.py be renamed to something else to avoid future confusion.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1450844548", "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1450741185", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["comparison-available", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "6e897c89256eeb084babe27fe52e1e775b5ef965", "merged_at": "1450844548", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 12838, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "remove unnecessary circular python dependency", "updated_at": "1454700018", "user": "wmtan"}

Just like before, the lepton has IP info both computed wrt the PV and wrt the beamSpot (though the 3D impact paramtere wrt the beam-spot IMHO makes no sense).\n- ioread rules are implemented for this impact parameter change, and tested reading 7.2.X from 7.4.0.pre8\n\nStill investigating two other minor but orthogonal points, one if the `numberOfHits` can be removed ( https://hypernews.cern.ch/HyperNews/CMS/get/physTools/3316.html ), and whether the muon HO energy should be added.\n\nA 75X request will also be added\n\n@arizzi\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 11, "closed_at": "1426095201", "comments": 8, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1425912574", "deletions": 215, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "8fd8b31e86ed2792ba2904c8eda1e408ec7e8177", "merged_at": "1426095201", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 8156, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "MiniAOD lepton updates (74X)", "updated_at": "1443642371", "user": "gpetruc"}

Previously, the const\nmethod 'correct' was using a member data for a temporary buffer\nwhich was being changes on each call to 'correct'. To make the\nroutine thread safe we now use a buffer on the stack if only a small\nbuffer is needed and use a std::vector if a larger buffer is needed.\n\nThis problem was caught by the static analyzer.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1425462250", "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1423684764", "deletions": 10, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "fcc07710895e6aefe0d960ea146ea5efdfeccfe4", "merged_at": "1425462250", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 7682, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Made FFTJetCorrector thread safe", "updated_at": "1428429706", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

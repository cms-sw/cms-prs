Since the later have much less events as they only run in fat events, only the ones from the l1tstage2 client are desired. With the removal of the ratio plots the l1tstage2emulator version of the histograms are not needed anymore and could be removed.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1525544453", "comments": 16, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1525072614", "deletions": 8, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "c87923c9eb58d07b4e6325ad6342682ce6335231", "merged_at": "1525544453", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 23096, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "L1T DQM Retire unneeded caloLayer2 data-emulator ratio plots", "updated_at": "1525544453", "user": "thomreis"}

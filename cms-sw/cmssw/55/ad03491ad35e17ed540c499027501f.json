This should alleviate the output size and the burden on disk and operation teams.\r\nThis is proposed in this PR. As a new  `eventSetupPathsKey`  (= `TkAlJetHTHLT`) is introduced here a new set of `AlCaRecoTriggerBitsRcd` tags:\r\n   * `AlCaRecoHLTpaths_2017_offline_v6` which is a superset of the production tag `AlCaRecoHLTpaths_2017_offline_v4`, but will all IOVs substituted by new payloads adding the `TkAlJetHT` key (used in `auto:run2_data*`)\r\n   * `AlCaRecoHLTpaths_2021_offline_v2`  which is a superset of the production tag `AlCaRecoHLTpaths_2021_offline_v1`, but will all IOVs substituted by new payloads adding the `TkAlJetHT` key (used in `auto:run3_data*`)\r\n\r\n##### Global Tag Changes:\r\n\r\n**run2_data**\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts//123X_dataRun2_v4/123X_dataRun2_v3\r\n\r\n**run2_data_HEfail**\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts//123X_dataRun2_HEfail_v4/123X_dataRun2_HEfail_v3\r\n\r\n**run2_data_relval**\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts//123X_dataRun2_relval_v5/123X_dataRun2_relval_v4\r\n\r\n**run3_data**\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts//123X_dataRun3_v9/123X_dataRun3_v7\r\n\r\n**run3_data_relval**\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts//123X_dataRun3_relval_v8/123X_dataRun3_relval_v6\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRun successfully the Tier-0 testing workflow:\r\n```console\r\nrunTheMatrix.py -l 1000.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nverbatim backport of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/38254\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "changed_files": 8, "closed_at": "1654852336", "comments": 16, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1654757776", "deletions": 7, "labels": ["alca-approved", "dqm-approved", "operations-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "backport-ok", "trk"], "merge_commit_sha": "4c2aa55d6b2be3ae49b9abbec88f7a80882b07ee", "merged_at": "1654852336", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 38297, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "[12.3.X] Introduce `TkAlJetHT`", "updated_at": "1654852336", "user": "mmusich"}

This part deals with most of the CSC customisations.  #7500 and #7503 are associated but are for different packages.  Each of these pull requests can be merged individually.\n\nNote that none of these changes have any effect unless the run2 era is explicitly used. Details on how to do that are on #7500.\n\nThere are still some CSC customisations to move from the helper customisation to the era.  I need to check the overlap with trigger code and I'll move those in a subsequent pull request.  As mentioned on #7500, the changes in the first commit (22f41e2) are just to update for external changes to the customisations in the last week, and not strictly related to this change (but still required).\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 8, "closed_at": "1422999120", "comments": 7, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1422896934", "deletions": 59, "labels": ["alca-pending", "comparison-available", "geometry-approved", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-pending", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "f7de0f1068b66add74f612b34810b6b96b1b7d5a", "merged_at": "1422999120", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 7506, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add most CSC changes to the run2 era", "updated_at": "1423154111", "user": "mark-grimes"}

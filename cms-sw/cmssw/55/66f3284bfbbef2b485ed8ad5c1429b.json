The new name gave a clearer idea what this function did, which is to return a chi2/dof (also known as reduced chi2) that was formed from the stub bend information.\r\nHowever, at that time a duplicate function with the original name was retained in TTTrack, to avoid breaking anyone's code. \r\n\r\nThis PR finally finally deletes function stubPtConsistency(), and updates the few classes that had not yet migrated to the new function name.\r\n\r\nThis has no effect on L1 tracking performance, since it is only a name change,\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 16, "comments": 8, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1765046913", "deletions": 48, "labels": ["l1-pending", "dqm-approved", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "trk"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_1_X", "number": 49565, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 6, "state": "open", "title": "Delete obsolete TTTrack::stubPtConsistency function", "updated_at": "1770811432", "user": "tomalin"}

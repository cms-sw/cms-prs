This involves three changes that I'm introducing in  this PR:\r\n\r\n- Fix test scripts multi-threading after changes introduced in #43042.\r\n   - Add tests for multi-treading in both scripts\r\n- Allow for Express processing of directly from streamer files, as this is the default mode of operations in Tier-0\r\n   - Add test for this new feature \r\n- Use '+' as separator for `RunAlcaSkimming.py` and `RunAlcaSkimming.py`, as is already done with the other test scripts\r\n   -  Update related automatic tests.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRunning `scram b runtests` shows no issues\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 11, "closed_at": "1727952246", "comments": 10, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1727102862", "deletions": 13, "labels": ["operations-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "cc3a20ce0f9c73659320cb1776e7695d721b5911", "merged_at": "1727952246", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_14_2_X", "number": 46103, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "Update data processing tests generation Tier-0 configurations", "updated_at": "1727952247", "user": "germanfgv"}

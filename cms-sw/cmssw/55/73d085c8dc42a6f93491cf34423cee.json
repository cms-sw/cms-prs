If another package is using Xerces at the same time, Xerces cleanup will be called when the use count goes to zero, crashing the other package.  This PR moves the calls to xercesTerminate() from RPCPacManager to the destructors of the classes that call xercesInitialize() so the calls will be matched.\r\n\r\nAFAICT, this bug has been there since the beginning of time, but only matters with the multi-threaded framework and multiple packages using Xerces at the same time.

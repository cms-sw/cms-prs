However, these calls do not work if called from setRunAndLumiInfo(), unless the run or lumi number changed, in which case the call is not needed.\nThis pull request ensures that a call to setNewRun() or setNewLumi() will cause a new run or new lumi transition.\nThis fix is needed by LHESource to process LHE input files with different headers in the same job.\nThis pull request needs normal testing and signature requirements.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1394698804", "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1394660978", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "fdff0bfd979a0dfcbf1130083db239f80bd37e44", "merged_at": "1394698804", "merged_by": "nclopezo", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_1_0_pre5", "number": 2834, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "setNewRun() and setNewLumi() should work always", "updated_at": "1395418534", "user": "wmtan"}

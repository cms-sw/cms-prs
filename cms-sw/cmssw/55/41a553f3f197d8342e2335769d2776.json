To simulated FED bad channel the scenarios from Pixel PCL payloads are utilised. The approach was presented at the last simulation meeting  https://indico.cern.ch/event/777956/contributions/3239525/attachments/1765581/2866399/tanjaSim_04112018.pdf.\r\nThe PR  introduces the novel `SiPixelFEDChannelContainer` and `SiPixelQualityProbabilities` Condition formats.\r\nThe changes proposed here are:\r\n   - added `SiPixelFEDChannelContainer` and `SiPixelQualityProbabilities`;\r\n   - added corresponding records for the `EventSetup`, respectively `SiPixelStatusScenariosRcd` and `SiPixelStatusScenarioProbabilityRcd`;\r\n   - added serialization tests for the new objects;\r\n   - added payload writers and readers for the new `CondFormats`;\r\n   - added utilities to import/fetch and dump payloads of the new type;\r\n\r\nCaveat: `SiPixelFEDChannelContainer` is essentially a wrapper around `PixelFEDChannel`, which being a `DataFormat` necessitates its own (trivial) serialization/deserialization rules (implemented in `CondFormats/External`). As we don't foresee to ever have to change the content of the `DataFormat` schema evolution is implicitly avoided.\r\n\r\nThe changes are introduced in the SiPixelDigitizer, where in each event one scenario is randomly chosen and the bad components contained in the chosen scenario are killed. The information about killed components is propagated to the the tracking via SiPixelRawToDigi.\r\nThe new feature is switched off by default.\r\n\r\n@mmusich @veszpv \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 36, "comments": 7, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1544483761", "deletions": 28, "labels": ["alca-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "db-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_4_X", "number": 25466, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Stuck tbm from cmssw 10 4 x 2018 12 07 2300", "updated_at": "1544512093", "user": "tsusa"}

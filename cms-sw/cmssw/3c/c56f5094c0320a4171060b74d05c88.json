It schedules the application of energy regression and the 2020Nov28 ID model by using the modifier logic run2_miniAOD_UL.\r\n\r\n  - This PR raises the minimum pT of input tracks considered by the ElectronSeed step from 0.5 to 1.0 GeV for the bParking era. Performance details are provided in the PR description for https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/33589. This change and it's motivation was presented recently to [XPOG](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1019415/contributions/4278490/attachments/2235130/3788280/210428_LowPtElectrons_XPOG.pdf), slides 8 and 9.\r\n\r\n  - This PR adds a new ID weights file (2021May17) for use with a BParking UL re-RECO or re-MINIAOD campaign. There is no appreciable CPU load (w.r.t. the original model), the memory footprint will reduce (due to the smaller weights file), and the RECO/AOD event size is unaffected. The 2021May17 performance can be found in the right plot of slide 5 [here](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1034467/contributions/4344267/attachments/2248230/3813485/LowPtElectrons_PPDMay21.pdf).\r\n\r\nAll non-RECO related changes listed above are included in the 10_6_X back port PR https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/33589. \r\n\r\nThis PR depends on cms-data/RecoEgamma-ElectronIdentification#21, which adds the weights file for the 2021May17 model. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n  - This PR has been tested locally with wfs 1304.182, 1325.518, 136.88811, 136.898. \r\n  - The behaviour for the \"no-change policy\" logic (~bParking & run2_miniAOD_UL) has also been tested locally.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1622694798", "comments": 36, "commits": 9, "created_at": "1620913500", "deletions": 16, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "67f6b890c36edbefcb95da190631e27efaf73e2e", "merged_at": "1622694798", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "number": 33725, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 7, "state": "closed", "title": "LowPtElectrons: support for UL re-MINIAOD and BParking UL RE-RECO", "updated_at": "1622694798", "user": "bainbrid"}

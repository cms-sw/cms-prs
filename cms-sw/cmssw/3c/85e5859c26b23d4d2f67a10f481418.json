DeepCSV is activated in its place.  Finally, an electron fix for 2018 reMiniAOD is also removed that is no longer necessary. \r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested 159, 140.5611 and 158.01\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1658849130", "comments": 24, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1657653137", "deletions": 34, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "pdmv-approved", "orp-approved", "upgrade-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "61a96f0a08f842805d9f8f71ac9965f32d92dd3f", "merged_at": "1658849130", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 38711, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Don't recluster jets in HI miniAOD for Run 3 ", "updated_at": "1658849131", "user": "mandrenguyen"}

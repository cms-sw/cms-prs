DeepCSV is activated in its place.  Finally, an electron fix for 2018 reMiniAOD is also removed that is no longer necessary. \r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested 159, 140.5611 and 158.01\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "comments": 10, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1657653137", "deletions": 34, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 38711, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Don't recluster jets in HI miniAOD for Run 3 ", "updated_at": "1657815054", "user": "mandrenguyen"}

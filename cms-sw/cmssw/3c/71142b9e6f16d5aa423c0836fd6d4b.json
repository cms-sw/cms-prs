Since their [default values for Phase-1](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/193041033d0c1947b0f942d8c086a73d6954b3c6/RecoLocalTracker/SiPixelClusterizer/plugins/SiPixelRawToClusterCUDA.cc#L129-L132) are valid for Run 2 (and not for Run 3), the Run-3 HLT menus became silently misconfigured as a result. This PR fixes that with a customisation function. The HLT menus will eventually be configured correctly in `ConfDB`, once HLT-menu development moves to the `13_2_X` cycle.\r\n>\r\n>In addition, the configuration parameter `isRun2` is removed from the plugin template `SiPixelRawToClusterCUDAT`, as #41632 made it unnecessary.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n`addOnTests.py` passed.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

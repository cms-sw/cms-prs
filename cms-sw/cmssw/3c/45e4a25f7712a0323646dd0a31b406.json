This PR has fixes for DDShapes classes. Conversions of angles from the degrees returned by DD4hep to the radians expected in CMS code are added. The `DDTruncTubs` class is corrected so that it returns correct values for its parameters.\r\n\r\nFor now, `DDPseudoTrap` is commented out as the need for this class is still under discussion.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis code was tested as described in #27674.\r\n\r\nNo backport is needed.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1565420280", "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1565364547", "deletions": 17, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "ef3ec84abc8410c9cd80ad36e836266aabf65fdf", "merged_at": "1565420280", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27740, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fixes for DDShapes to support DD4hep migration", "updated_at": "1565420281", "user": "cvuosalo"}

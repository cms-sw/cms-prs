Also ran `runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos` and no failures were seen.\r\n\r\nChanges in this PR have been already approved in [42348](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/42348)", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "comments": 0, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1690886019", "deletions": 68, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_3_X", "number": 42437, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Removal of StringCutObjectSelector from Muon trigger DQM", "updated_at": "1690886042", "user": "caruta"}

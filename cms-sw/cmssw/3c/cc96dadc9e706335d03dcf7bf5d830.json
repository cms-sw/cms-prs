I did include both changes from the PR for simplicity (the factory and the SUEP plugin itself), but I can take the former out of the code if deemed more appropriate as it is just a backport.\r\n\r\n## Original PR description\r\n\r\nThis PR includes two main changes:\r\n- A mechanism to add UserHooks to Pythia8Hadronizer through the usage of a PluginFactory (thanks to @kpedro88 for the idea and pointers on how to), so the source code of the main pythia plugin does not need to be modified when adding user modifications. This idea can be used in the future to migrate the current implementation of several UserHooks that are currently hard-coded.\r\n- A module dedicated to soft unclustered energy pattern (SUEP or soft-bombs)-like decays, following the description of 1612.00850. It can be used to decay an SM particle through a soft-bomb shower.\r\n   - The suep shower code (header and source) is taken directly from Simon Knapen's implementation and adapted to cmssw's code standards.\r\n   - The module uses the previously discussed PluginFactory to be included inside the Pythia8Hadronizer and can be used for decays of ME obtained from either pythia or a LHE producer such as madgraph. An example of its usage can be found here. It's usage is based on the inclusion of the following lines inside the process.generator inside the fragment:\r\n\r\n>\r\n        UserCustomization = cms.VPSet(\r\n           cms.PSet(\r\n             pluginName = cms.string(\"SuepDecay\"),\r\n             idDark = cms.int32(999999), # pdgId of the dark meson\r\n             idMediator = cms.int32(25), # pdgId of the mediator\r\n             temperature = cms.double(2) # Temperature of the thermal distribution\r\n           )\r\n\r\n## PR validation\r\n\r\nUnit tests passed.\r\nTests using a local config file show that the SUEP module properly decays the Higgs boson.\r\n\r\n## Backporting:\r\n\r\nBackport of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/36238", "branch": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "changed_files": 9, "closed_at": "1640015485", "comments": 16, "commits": 13, "created_at": "1639590786", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["generators-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "backport-ok"], "merge_commit_sha": "940adfed88f97c51f9f5f1f3c171fb23eff5c3af", "merged_at": "1640015485", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 36509, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Backport of Factory for adding UserHooks to PythiaHadronizer and SUEP decay pythia Hook", "updated_at": "1640015485", "user": "cericeci"}

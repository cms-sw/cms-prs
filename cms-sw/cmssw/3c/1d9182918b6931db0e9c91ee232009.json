In addition, there is no longer a need to have calorimeter-specific Phase2 Eras (since we now only support C3), so the Phase2C2\\* Eras are renamed to Phase2\\*.\r\n\r\nTwo new geometries are added: D19 to preserve a timing layer configuration, and D20 to preserve a flat tracker configuration. (The flat tracker is not expected to persist too much longer, but is needed in the short term.)\r\n\r\nNow that we are converging on the \"final\" Phase2 simulation geometry and have moved to a new development branch (9_3_X), I have made the decision to allow the runTheMatrix workflow numbers to change. This means that the 2023D17 workflows start at 20000, and so on.\r\n\r\n@ianna, I think I found all the places where auxiliary geometry-related files need to be changed, but please let me know if I missed anything.\r\n\r\nattn: @boudoul @calabria @jshlee @cseez @lgray @bsunanda ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 36, "closed_at": "1498660548", "comments": 11, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1498574707", "deletions": 972, "labels": ["comparison-available", "db-pending", "geometry-approved", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved", "visualization-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "0f37c81cae4c1562cf58fee4a186c0973aefaf66", "merged_at": "1498660548", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_3_X", "number": 19452, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "Remove unneeded Phase2 geometries, workflows, Eras", "updated_at": "1498660548", "user": "kpedro88"}

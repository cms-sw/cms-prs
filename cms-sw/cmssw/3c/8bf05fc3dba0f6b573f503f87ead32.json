It does some finishing touches on top of #22375 :\r\n* Add PU definition to the workflow parameters\r\n* Drop DIGI2RAW from the workflow steps\r\n* Customize `PREMIX` event content to include digis\r\n   * Here I'm unsure if it would be better to defined another event content (e.g. `PREMIXDIGI`) and use that\r\n\r\nI can't exclude further changes on the stage1 workflow, but this setup turned out to be enough to get work on stage2 workflow started. I think it is in good-enough shape now to be tested regularly in IBs.\r\n\r\nTested in CMSSW_10_1_X_2018-03-05-2300, no changes expected in existing workflows.\r\n\r\n@mdhildreth @kpedro88 ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 0, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1520428017", "deletions": 3, "labels": [], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_1_X", "number": 22510, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Enable premixing stage1 workflow for phase2", "updated_at": "1520428029", "user": "makortel"}

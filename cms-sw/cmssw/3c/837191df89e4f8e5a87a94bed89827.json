The change extends the module's usage from only handling 2 Jet + 2 Tau events to also handling 2 Jet + 1 Tau events. This change depends on no other PRs and affects code used by one existing HLT path, and would allow the implementation of a future HLT path.  \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nIn the course of estimating rate and gain for the proposed VBF Single Tau path, the same metrics were also computed for the VBF DiTau path with the module extension in place and no differences were found in past and current behavior of the path. \r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 4, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1678269344", "deletions": 13, "labels": ["hlt-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "number": 40990, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "open", "title": "extended existing HLT module to handle 2Jet + 1Tau events in addition", "updated_at": "1678271654", "user": "brallmond"}

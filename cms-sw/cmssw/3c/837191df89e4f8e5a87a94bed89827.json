The change extends the module's usage from only handling 2 Jet + 2 Tau events to also handling 2 Jet + 1 Tau events. This change depends on no other PRs and affects code used by one existing HLT path, and would allow the implementation of a future HLT path.  \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nIn the course of estimating rate and gain for the proposed VBF Single Tau path, the same metrics were also computed for the VBF DiTau path with the module extension in place and no differences were found in past and current behavior of the path. \r\n\r\n#### Backport \r\nmaster PR is https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/40993\r\nIt's necessary to Backport this change as current testing and HLT development is taking place in CMSSW_13_0_0", "branch": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 16, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1678269344", "deletions": 18, "labels": ["hlt-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "backport-ok"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "number": 40990, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "open", "title": "extended existing HLT tau-jet correlation module [13_0_X]", "updated_at": "1678394223", "user": "brallmond"}

If I saw something that looked bad\r\nin the vicinity of the shadowing fixes.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis relies on existing tests. Nothing should change in the externally\r\nvisible behavior of the code.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 46, "closed_at": "1569324330", "comments": 36, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1568837638", "deletions": 1169, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "5beb80d333d8b5c0a3efba07ac3990f40e1144cd", "merged_at": "1569324330", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 28022, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 32, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix GCC 9 shadowing compiler warnings in Core (2nd try)", "updated_at": "1569324331", "user": "wddgit"}

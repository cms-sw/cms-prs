This uses the same (now generalized) method that is use in the Phase-0/1 simulations. For now it's set to False by default.\r\n\r\nThis is a DRAFT PR to seek comments:\r\n * for now I didn't touch the late charge reweighting, I believe it's not (yet) relevant for Phase-2\r\n * general comments on the implementation\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n`20834.0` ran fine with the default `False` value.\r\nAfter the compilation issue for Phase-1, I also ran `250202.184` which tests the late charge rew (this failed with some input error), and `11634.0` which is for realistic 2021.\r\n\r\nI plan to run with LA trees and show the charge vs depth profiles with the `True` option next (and then will move the PR away from being a draft)\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nNot a backport and no backport is needed.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 9, "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1672686597", "deletions": 126, "labels": ["simulation-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "number": 40417, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[Draft] Include charge reweighting for Phase-2 IT", "updated_at": "1672766011", "user": "tvami"}

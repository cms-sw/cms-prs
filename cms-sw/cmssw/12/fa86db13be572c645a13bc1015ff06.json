This uses the same (now generalized) method that is use in the Phase-0/1 simulations. For now it's set to False by default. For now I didn't touch the late charge reweighting, I believe it's not (yet) relevant for Phase-2\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n`20834.0` ran fine with the default `False` value.\r\nAfter the compilation issue for Phase-1, I also ran `250202.184` which tests the late charge rew (this failed with some input error), and `11634.0` which is for realistic 2021.\r\n\r\nwhen `UseReweighting = True`, I used the `20834.0`  wf but modified the step2 to \r\n```\r\ncmsDriver.py step2 -s DIGI:pdigi_valid,L1TrackTrigger,L1,DIGI2RAW,HLT:@fake2 --conditions 125X_mcRun4_realistic_Candidate_2023_01_03_23_47_45 --datatier GEN-SIM-DIGI-RAW -n 10 --eventcontent FEVTDEBUGHLT --geometry Extended2026D88 --era Phase2C17I13M9 --filein file:step1.root --fileout file:step2.root\r\n```\r\nwhere `125X_mcRun4_realistic_Candidate_2023_01_03_23_47_45` contains the 2D templates needed for the charge reweighting. This runs fine as well.\r\n\r\nRun LA trees and showed the charge vs depth profiles with the `True` option, the outcome looks as expected.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

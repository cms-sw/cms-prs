This mode is not turned on by default.\n\n(b) Flags to expose the Fourier orders that are going to be subtracted. This was inadvertently hard-coded before.\n\nThe changes are merged due to otherwise conflicting diffs.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 44, "closed_at": "1444832397", "comments": 20, "commits": 26, "created_at": "1443090135", "deletions": 2397, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "core-pending", "hlt-pending", "l1-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 11452, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 16, "state": "closed", "title": "Heavy ion Vs algorithm same event subtraction", "updated_at": "1444832397", "user": "yslai"}

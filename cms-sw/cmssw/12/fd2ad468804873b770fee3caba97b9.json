The fix is simple, just calculate E in a way without ratios involved. This should be a fix for #41397\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nChecked that the crash and nan candidate are removed. The mass scaling works properly now.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

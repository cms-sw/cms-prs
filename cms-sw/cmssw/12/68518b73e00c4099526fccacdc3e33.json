This is done via CaloParamsHelper class which ensures the backward compatibility of GlobalTags.\n- Introduce a new calo configuration file caloStage2Params_2016_v3_3_HI_cfi, which configures the above parameters as for HI run needs, but also changes the `egShapeIdLUTFile` to a DUMMY LUT effectively bypassing egShapeID cut in the EG Layer2 emulator.\n- Still keep the p-p default calo configuration in hackConditions as caloStage2Params_2016_v3_3_cfi.  This will probably be changed to the v3_3_HI or similar, pending confirmation from the HI community.\n\nInstructions for HI users provided at this issue: https://github.com/cms-l1t-offline/cmssw/issues/432\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 12, "closed_at": "1478154347", "comments": 17, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1477784265", "deletions": 9, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "a863bcee7355c0b22e9d53c322b0cbe7c7dea877", "merged_at": "1478154347", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 16390, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "pr80x_HI-configurable-CaloLayer2-emulator ", "updated_at": "1478154347", "user": "rekovic"}

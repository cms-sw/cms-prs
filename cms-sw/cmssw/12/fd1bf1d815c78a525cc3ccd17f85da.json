Overall this should increase the number of tracks reconstructed by the Legacy client so that it can fit PVs and eventually the Beamspot.\r\n- Fixed a typo in the name of the Legacy BeamSpotOnline tag\r\n\r\n**[Important Note]** \r\nThis PR contains an additional commit to remove the following customization in the BeamSpot Legacy DQM client:\r\n```\r\nprocess.pixelTracksTrackingRegions.RegionPSet.ptMin = 0.1\r\n```\r\nThis customization was used in 12_0_X during PilotBeam 2021 data taking due to the special collision conditions, but should not be applied for standard collision.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nValidated with DQM playback system and also during data-taking, see https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/35918#issuecomment-956087758 and https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/35918#issuecomment-956119341 for the outcome of the data-taking.\r\n\r\n#### Backport\r\nA backport to 12_0_X is provided in #35918\r\nA backport to 12_1_X is provided in #35935\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1635864724", "comments": 13, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1635759464", "deletions": 13, "labels": ["dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "requires-external", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "715a334fea836330cdb7bc520b6cf3589be904ca", "merged_at": "1635864724", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_2_X", "number": 35932, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Improve DQM beamspot clients", "updated_at": "1635876121", "user": "francescobrivio"}

By default both parameters are set to 8 as specified in the GEM TDR and Muon Upgrade TDR.  Both GEM chambers (`GEMChamber`) and ME0 chambers (`ME0Layer`) are designed to send out max 8 clusters of 8 neighboring trigger pads. In case there are more than 8 clusters, the algorithm selects the first 8. The cluster selection procedure is expected to be optimized later.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1504282879", "comments": 28, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1501548953", "deletions": 22, "labels": ["code-checks-pending", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "a9c9ffa855c857d482ec73fc286d6cf5572be639", "merged_at": "1504282879", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_3_X", "number": 19986, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 11, "state": "closed", "title": "Restrict GEM/ME0 cluster size and max N clusters", "updated_at": "1504286748", "user": "dildick"}

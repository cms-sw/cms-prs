When a wrong BDT tree is loaded, the number of variables in the BDT tree may differ from what is carried by the event data. This can cause out-of-bounds accesses in the particular vector (`e->data`) that stores the event variables.\r\n\r\nThe suggestion from @smuzaffar has been implemented. For further details, please refer to #29332 .\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis was checked with the ASAN release (`CMSSW_11_2_ASAN_X_2020-05-22-2300`) using:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrunTheMatrix.py -i all --ibeos -t 4 -l 1330.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nBefore the fix, there was an AddressSanitizer error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n1 0 0 0 0 tests passed, 0 1 0 0 0 failed\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter the fix:\r\n\r\n```\r\n1 1 1 1 1 tests passed, 0 0 0 0 0 failed\r\n```", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1591723438", "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1590774645", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "l1-pending", "orp-approved", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "b96c9a32c667f246380b2fd4039f941056bba352", "merged_at": "1591723438", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 30051, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "EMTF: Prevent out-of-bounds access in BDT event data", "updated_at": "1591723438", "user": "jiafulow"}

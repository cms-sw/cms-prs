This has been a known issue for quite a while but has come up again during tests of the Phase 2 3D pixel integration ([link](https://indico.cern.ch/event/988841/contributions/4324847/attachments/2227951/3774435/LocalRecoTemplatesIn3D_and_planars.pdf)). \r\n\r\nIn general these template reconstruction errors are quite rare, so the overall effect of these changes is expected to be quite small. \r\n\r\n### PR Testing\r\nTesting has been done on phase 1 workflows with TTbar + Pu with 2024 conditions. The difference in hit residuals and tracking performance is very minor. \r\nSlides [here](https://oamram.web.cern.ch/oamram/work/pixel/slides/template_LA_fix.pdf)\r\nFull tracking validation plots [here](https://oamram.web.cern.ch/oamram/work/pixel/template_LA_fix_tracking_val/)\r\n[Link to Pixel Offline (virtual) meeting slides](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1000807/#12-validation-for-pr33495-virt)\r\n\r\nBecause of the update to the HLT configuration, the addOnTests have been run as well. \r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 9, "closed_at": "1619590343", "comments": 19, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1619034237", "deletions": 95, "labels": ["bug-fix", "code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "hlt-approved", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "13aea0f28d92e4f4aa95e8c0e904c579181bb95a", "merged_at": "1619590343", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "number": 33495, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 18, "state": "closed", "title": "Use Lorentz Angle from data base for pixel template CPE's in case of error ", "updated_at": "1619590344", "user": "OzAmram"}

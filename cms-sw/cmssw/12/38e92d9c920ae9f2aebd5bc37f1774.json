It is similar to T21/T24, with the main changes occurring in TFPX and TEPX, and a minor change in the OT (updated TB2S module spacing). All sensors in the IT are 25x100 um2 planar \r\n\r\nThe changes in TFPX and TEPX are:\r\n- More realistic TFPX module placement (global shift in z positions of the disks, increase in dphi between the modules around 90 degrees, small rotation of modules around global z axis, dependent on the module position)\r\n- Re-ordering of the module placement on the dees in TFPX\r\n\r\nAs a consequence of the last point, a new hierarchy level (subdisk) has been introduced for the forward pixel to address issues observed in the tracking (not all hits from one TP entering the same track, leading to a high prevalence of additional tracks with only a few hits). This new hierarchy level required the addition of a new detID schema, which is used both in TFPX and TEPX, where the same approach is useful.\r\n\r\nMore information, and validation of these changes, can be found [in these slides](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1072175/contributions/4649242/attachments/2362724/4033640/TFEPX_AdW_1012.pdf).\r\n\r\nNote: the new hierarchy level, and associated further changes to the code, is only used in TX1 for the moment. All other tracker geometries use the already existing phase 2 detID schema and are not affected by the changes implemented here.\r\n\r\n@emiglior FYI\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n- Checked runTheMatrix workflows run without errors (including workflows not using the new detID schema)\r\n- Checked position of the modules matches that expected in the mechanical design\r\n- Analysis of tracking validation plots and other diagnostic tests as detailed [here](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1072175/contributions/4649242/attachments/2362724/4033640/TFEPX_AdW_1012.pdf)\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nNot a backport\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 43, "comments": 11, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1641807260", "deletions": 21, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "l1-pending", "alca-pending", "geometry-pending", "operations-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 36660, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Phase2 tracker: add TX1 (geometry with more realistic TFPX)", "updated_at": "1642438531", "user": "adewit"}

Also changed (the value of the deviation from the expected timing above which bad quality is triggered) to 1.0.", "branch": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1493287075", "comments": 12, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1490351050", "deletions": 8, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "cab107641c8e8478c1b1747cd838b5f24c209bd4", "merged_at": "1493287075", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "number": 18069, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Adding Timing vs BX plots, and modifying thresholds for laser quality", "updated_at": "1493288915", "user": "tanmaymudholkar"}

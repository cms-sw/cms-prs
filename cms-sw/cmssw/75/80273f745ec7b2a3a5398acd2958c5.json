It adds an EventSetup-consumes migrated code path to `TrackTransformer` helper class to allow getting (closer to) full migration of some Muon EDModules (IIRC this effort started form `MuonKinkFinder` helper class). Removing the non-ESGetToken code path is not feasible at this time, because `TrackTransformer` is used in Alignment in an EDLooper (which, as of today, can not declare consumption of ED nor ES products #31745).\r\n \r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 17, "closed_at": "1603257657", "comments": 15, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1602889647", "deletions": 181, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "51d30bfb549fed10621c574b08f86f4981acdf11", "merged_at": "1603257657", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 31833, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "Add EventSetup-consumes-migrated code path to TrackTransformer, use it in some Muon code", "updated_at": "1603257657", "user": "makortel"}

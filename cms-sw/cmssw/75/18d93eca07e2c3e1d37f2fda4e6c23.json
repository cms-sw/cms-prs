However, with the removal of CSVv2 from MINIAOD, the `pfSecondaryVertexTagInfos ` collection is no longer produced in the MINIAOD step, so the `bTagSVDQM ` module  would crash. \r\n> \r\n> This problem has not been revealed so far because in `bTagMiniDQM_cff.py`, the `miniAOD_skip_trackExtras` (part of `run2_miniAOD_UL_preSummer20`) modifier was used to exclude the `bTagSVDQM` module. However, since the default MINIAOD no longer has `pfSecondaryVertexTagInfos`, the `bTagSVDQM` module should also be removed in the default configuration too. \r\n> \r\n> #### PR validation:\r\n> \r\n> Tested with `runTheMatrix.py -w nano --ibeos -l 2500.2601,2500.2701`.\r\n> \r\n> #### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

When job completes successfully or with another error, that temporary element is not written. The new error was added to edm::errors.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles, framework unit tests pass. \r\nNOTE: some of the unit test results had to be changed from the original PR. Reason unknown.\r\n\r\nBackport of #41124. Needed for workflow management parsing of framework job reports.\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "changed_files": 19, "closed_at": "1692211249", "comments": 10, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1692125760", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "6f67be209487a243e0b14e8870330b1172bd52b1", "merged_at": "1692211249", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "number": 42576, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add temporary failure element to Framework Job Report [13_0]", "updated_at": "1692211249", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

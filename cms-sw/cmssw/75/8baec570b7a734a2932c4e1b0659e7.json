The problem was a spurious delete of `theRegionProducer` in `halt()` (called from `PixelTrackProducer::endRun()`), while it is constructed now in the PixelTrackReconstruction constructor. The bug was introduced in 4f569be1 (probably by mistake in rebase or something).\n\nThe `theMerger_` would have suffered from the same problem, so I changed it too to `std:unique_ptr`.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1392977143", "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1392966419", "deletions": 9, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "f5e1284a4c53d7b3301978adfc554bf0e016b662", "merged_at": "1392977143", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_1_0_pre5", "number": 2571, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix segfault in PixelTrackReconstruction", "updated_at": "1476951378", "user": "makortel"}

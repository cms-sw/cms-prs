We stop it by sending a SIGINT signal, however `ExternalLHEProducer` is throwing an exception if not all events were processed. This will be used for the Monte Carlo request validation purposes, so we don't care if we miss some events.\r\n\r\nThis PR enables us to suppress the exception by setting a `VALIDATION_RUN` environment variable (naming topic is open for suggestions) before running `cmsRun`.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n - `scram b runtests` tests succeeded\r\n - Tried a `cmsRun` with same changes, but in 10_6 release and it worked as expected\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nNot a backport, but backports will be needed.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1620212046", "comments": 9, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1620144860", "deletions": 9, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "generators-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "e1e024fb5fcb5aa6591ab8a0baab29d529758d9e", "merged_at": "1620212046", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "number": 33624, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Allow to suppress ExternalLHEProducer exception if not all events were processed", "updated_at": "1620212046", "user": "justinasr"}

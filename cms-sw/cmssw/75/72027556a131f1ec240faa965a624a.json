The idea is to separate the genuine data certification code related to Tau DQM from mc validation which is in the Validation/RecoTau package. Common part of the data & mc code are kept in the DQMOffline/PFTau and will also be used by mc validation.\nThese changes have been approved by TauPOG and you can see the slides here for more details,\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/565857/contributions/2285741/attachments/1328124/1994864/TauDQM_29Aug16.pdf\n\ncc: @roger-wolf \n\nAutomatically ported from CMSSW_8_1_X #15744 (original by @amodakgit).", "branch": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "changed_files": 44, "closed_at": "1487433099", "comments": 2, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1479286255", "deletions": 66, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "dqm-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "number": 16642, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Tau DQM code relocation from Validation/RecoTau area", "updated_at": "1487433099", "user": "cmsbuild"}

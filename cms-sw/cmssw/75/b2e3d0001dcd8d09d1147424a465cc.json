The LUTs were deployed at P5 on October 6th, but they are not used in the emulator yet. \r\n\r\nThis PR needs the LUTs in https://github.com/cms-data/L1Trigger-L1TMuon/pull/23 to work.\r\n\r\nWe see improvement in EMTF performance at P5 with these new LUTs, so changes to muon efficiencies etc are expected when testing the re-emulation workflows from recent runs (after October 6th). Otherwise this PR shouldn't change anything in the emulator.\r\n\r\nThis PR should be backported to 12_4 if there is an opportunity to run this at P5 to improve data/emulator comparisons in DQM. If data taking with 12_5 is expected we should also backport it there. \r\n\r\nThis has no effect on MC production so MC campaigns do not matter for the purpose of this PR.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with a description of the feature proposed or problem addressed, specifying:\r\n  - what changes are expected in the output if any, \r\n  - what other PRs or externals it depends upon if any,\r\n  - link to any additional material useful to provide a documentation for this PR (slides, JIRA tickets, related pull requestes, hypernews, TWiki or Indico pages)  -->\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n`runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos` has no failures.

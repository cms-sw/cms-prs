The initial guess is to treat the new quadruplet iterations as the (current) triplet iterations. @bachtis @arizzi @gpetruc feel free to double-check.\n- `LhcTrackAnalyzer` is supposedly not used, and is thus modified to throw if it encounters a track with phase1-specific algo, as agreed with alignment (@tlampen @mschrode).\n- `AdHocNtupler` was straightforward to migrate.\n\nTracking validation and DQM will be migrated separately (need the phase1 era for that, see e.g. #12806).\n\nTested in 8_0_0_pre4, no changes expected in Run2 workflows.\n\n@rovere @VinInn \n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 9, "closed_at": "1450844533", "comments": 7, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1450550330", "deletions": 24, "labels": ["alca-approved", "analysis-pending", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "fe41cc4ee21492f885199da9fc9792bd2f4ef9b4", "merged_at": "1450844533", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 12834, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Set phase1 track algorithms properly", "updated_at": "1476957068", "user": "makortel"}

These seemed to be caused by the processing of EDAliases and SwitchProducers for ConditionalTasks being repeated for all the Paths of the HLT menu (e.g. the SwitchProducer loop has N(paths) x N(modules)  overall complexity).\r\n\r\nThis PR attempts to speed up the job startup time by processing the EDAliases and SwitchProducers for ConditionalTasks only once for all Paths, leading to > 10x improvement in the `StreamSchedule` constructor\r\nhttps://mkortela.web.cern.ch/mkortela/cgi-bin/navigator/issue38725/hlt_ConditionalTask_36_perf/12\r\nbringing the time close to what it would be if the HLT menu would use Tasks instead of ConditionalTasks\r\nhttps://mkortela.web.cern.ch/mkortela/cgi-bin/navigator/issue38725/hlt_Task_06_perf/12\r\n\r\nResolves #38725\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nFramework unit tests run.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1657852625", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1657738052", "deletions": 95, "labels": ["core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "23f159eadb2ce443c56a2ab06e37ca5c53b7a9fc", "merged_at": "1657852624", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 38730, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 9, "state": "closed", "title": "Preprocess EDAlias and SwitchProducer information for ConditionalTask", "updated_at": "1657852625", "user": "makortel"}

After propagation from pixel layer to DT the very large uncertainty spreads to all parameters (typical cov values of 1E14). This then fails numerically in the KF update.\nSome truncation of uncertainties to improve numerical stability could be done.\nThe issue appears rather rarely and is expected to be more frequent for poorly measured tracks.\nSo, the physics benefits of better numerical behavior in similar cases is marginal.\n\nthe fix should affect only events that would otherwise crash in processing\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1466746520", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1466712559", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "2461c323f7362246fed293bfed24e3794493f8fe", "merged_at": "1466746520", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 14967, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "check if updated TSOS is good in DYT to avoid a crash", "updated_at": "1466746521", "user": "slava77"}

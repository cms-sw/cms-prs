Sorry @perrotta there were a ton of conflicts, so I decided to start over. \r\n\r\nVerbatim:\r\nAdding MC workflows to test --era Run2_2017 with --scenario Heavyions.\r\nAdding wfs are 150, 150.1, 150.2 and 150.3\r\nThe latter 3 are migrated from Run 1 wfs 140.1, 140.2 and 140.4\r\nAll Hydjet MinBias wfs have been changed to Hydjet impact parameter = 12 fm, which will take care of the memory limitations in running heavy-ion events in relval.\r\nThe event overlay wfs (300-302) have not been migrated yet. This will wait for when b=12 GEN-SIM has been produced in a pre-release relval.\r\n\r\nThe validation and DQM sequences also had to be brought into sync with their pp Phase I equivalents.\r\nTo get these sequences to run I modified the heavy-ion HCAL local reco such that it now runs both hbheprereco and hbhereco, as is the case in pp.\r\nI'm not really sure why this was ever different in the first place though.\r\nFeedback on this would be appreciated.\r\n\r\n@igv4321 @hatakeyamak @deguio please take note of comments from @kpedro88 \r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 10, "closed_at": "1498627121", "comments": 70, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1496585022", "deletions": 42, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-pending", "generators-pending", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-approved", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "2c4ba78794b870b6e721ef231ad19acf522cc15f", "merged_at": "1498627121", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_3_X", "number": 19089, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 9, "state": "closed", "title": "Add Phase I heavy-ion relval wf (take 2)", "updated_at": "1499769939", "user": "mandrenguyen"}

This is corrected by adding the `cond::payloadInspector::SINGLE_IOV` template specification.\r\nI profit of the PR to add a slightly improved display of the IoV since (including the run number and LS of the `cond::Time_t since`).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe unit tests of this package run correctly.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nNot a backport, not meant to be backported.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 4, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1752233915", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["db-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 48534, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "minor improvements and bug-fixes to `LHCInfo` PayloadInspector", "updated_at": "1752234591", "user": "mmusich"}

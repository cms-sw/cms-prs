Run2 and Run3 ones). For testing and validation puposes it's important for PPS to be able to process both Run2 and Run3 data and simulation. This PR removes the old files and allows to manage the detector topology via the EventSetup, so that the same code can be used to processed data taken or simulated with different pixel detectors. The corresponding setup is chosen by means of the Era mechanism.\r\n\r\nNo changes in the output are expected.\r\n\r\nThis PR will be followed by the implementation of the new (Run3) detector Geometry.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nPrivate tests with real data and simulation show no difference in the output of PPS detectors.\r\nrunTheMatrix tests are successful.\r\n\r\nNo backport is expected.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 36, "closed_at": "1614066090", "comments": 26, "commits": 8, "created_at": "1612965584", "deletions": 439, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "db-pending", "dqm-approved", "geometry-approved", "orp-approved", "pdmv-approved", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "d84d78bc7708ed8c0329b18d892956661b2ef6fd", "merged_at": "1614066090", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 32868, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "PPS pixel topology", "updated_at": "1614066090", "user": "fabferro"}

To get a reasonable rate, new kinematic constraints on the dimuon events need to be placed at the HLT.\r\n  - Added options to make a selection on the minimum angle required between L3 muons in the trigger\r\n  - Added option to invert the mass window cut on the invariant mass of L3 muons \r\n  - This is based on the presentation at https://indico.cern.ch/event/1090283/#33-level-3-paths-for-singlet-t\r\n\r\n  - Sam James Harper noticed that error management in the module can be improved.\r\n  - It is ideal to throw an exception at the constructor level when that error renders the module of no use. This enable catching the error in the build phase instead of having to wait for a message from cmsRun.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with a description of which tests have been performed to verify the correctness of the PR, including the eventual addition of new code for testing like unit tests, test configurations, additions or updates to the runTheMatrix test workflows -->\r\n\r\n  - Standard set of checks performed at https://cms-sw.github.io/PRWorkflow.html were done and passed.\r\n  - A trigger was made with the suggested changes. We observed expected behavior from this trigger of interest. \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 6, "commits": 11, "created_at": "1637850882", "deletions": 56, "labels": ["hlt-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-rejected"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_2_X", "number": 36250, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 17, "state": "open", "title": "Add option for invert mass window cut and Delta R for HLTMuonDimuonL3Filter", "updated_at": "1637936664", "user": "arsahasransu"}

Suggestions to achieve this is welcome.  \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nrunTheMatrix.py -l 1325.7,10042.0,10024.0,10224.0,10824.0,10224.15,11024.15,25202.15  -i all --ibeos\r\ngave no error (those are workflows where the NANOAOD step is run, the last three with custom JME configuration). \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1600078884", "comments": 19, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1599866043", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved", "xpog-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "17bb5eeb08da1883bbe3c04eacd2cad0415c2fb9", "merged_at": "1600078883", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 31446, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "HF shower shape fix for custom JME NanoAOD workflow", "updated_at": "1600095012", "user": "lathomas"}

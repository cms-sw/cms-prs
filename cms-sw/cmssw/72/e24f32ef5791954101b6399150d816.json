Added elements are the 6 fine grain bits occupancy readout at uHTR/layer1 and their comparison, and the single LLP feature bit output expected vs emulated.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nValidated by running offline DQM on past commissioning runs, expected plots are produced. It has also been included in the online DQM production release based on 12_6_3 (https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/40737) and tested online during MWGR on 9 Feb. Test went fine, so this PR to master is to make it permanent.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1676365733", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1676146486", "deletions": 45, "labels": ["dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved", "hcal"], "merge_commit_sha": "d32bfd821fd0a23b7eebb354fc51b2f7917962b9", "merged_at": "1676365733", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_13_1_X", "number": 40751, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "HCAL Fb DQM monitoring at layer1", "updated_at": "1676365733", "user": "hftsoi"}

One concerned the ranking of seed types, which had been accidentallly disabled for displced tracks. The other concerned the \"inventStubs\" option, Which had incorrectly assumed L2L3D1 seeds use L2D1 to determine the r-z helix params, whereas it is really L2L3. The inventStubs option has also been disabled until we've understood if it causes a memory leak.\r\n\r\nIt also includes a tidy up of the code in PurgeDuplicate::getInventedCoordsExtended() from @aehart .\r\n\r\nOn ttbar+200PU, the performance of the extended L1 tracking is:\r\n\r\n# Before bug fix:\r\n\r\nefficiency (for pt > 3 GeV) = 96.46 +- 0.14%\r\ntracks/event = 350\r\n\r\n# After bug fix:\r\n\r\nefficiency (for Pt > 3 GeV) = 96.72 +- 0.14%\r\ntracks/event = 262\r\n\r\nThe PR also includes minor changes to a ROOT plotting macro.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "comments": 11, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1711651839", "deletions": 62, "labels": ["l1-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 44574, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Fix bug in L1 track duplicate removal for displaced tracking", "updated_at": "1712748452", "user": "tomalin"}

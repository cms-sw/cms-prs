Therefore, this PR also modifies Runs 2&3, by including the new record. Anyway, for the moment no new parameters are introduced. We will take care setting the new parameters describing big pixels to dummy values for the geometries before phase-2.**\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n-  compilation ok after git cms-checkdeps -a\r\n- scram b code-checks, code-format\r\n- checked on ph-2 w/f 25610\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

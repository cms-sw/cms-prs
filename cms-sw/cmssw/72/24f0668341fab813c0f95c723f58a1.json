I don't know how important the migration of these modules to streamer ones is. For any case, I have migrated the modules and verified that HLT runs and gives the same rates before and after the migration. Similar PRs will be made for 76X and 80X.\n\nI am cc'ing TSG experts for comments.\n\n@mandrenguyen @fwyzard @Martin-Grunewald \n\nCheers,\nKrisztian\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1447690941", "comments": 10, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1447430583", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["comparison-available", "daq-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "be42936d3e970f28e28611a50b33045ada18e016", "merged_at": "1447690941", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 12415, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Migration of modules used in PbPb HLT to do ZeroSuppression to stream modules in 75X", "updated_at": "1447690942", "user": "kkrajczar"}

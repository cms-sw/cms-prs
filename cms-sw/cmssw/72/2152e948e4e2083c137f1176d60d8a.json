More recently, a comment by @Dr15Jones (https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/20666#issuecomment-365267856) helped me realize how to avoid calling `updateGeometry()` unnecessarily. I also removed unnecessary copying of objects in `HcalShapes`. With these changes, @ianna confirms that `HcalDigitizer` CPU usage is reduced.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "comments": 1, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1520538676", "deletions": 63, "labels": ["code-checks-pending", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_1_X", "number": 22538, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Improve event setup usage in HCAL digitization", "updated_at": "1520538697", "user": "kpedro88"}

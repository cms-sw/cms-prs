More recently, a comment by @Dr15Jones (https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/20666#issuecomment-365267856) helped me realize how to avoid calling `updateGeometry()` unnecessarily. I also removed unnecessary copying of objects in `HcalShapes`. With these changes, @ianna confirms that `HcalDigitizer` CPU usage is reduced.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1520695740", "comments": 11, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1520538676", "deletions": 63, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "58a31df1b63c835cbfba31dc27e888c69ccb9d79", "merged_at": "1520695740", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_1_X", "number": 22538, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Improve event setup usage in HCAL digitization", "updated_at": "1520695741", "user": "kpedro88"}

Rather, this pull request includes cleanups of `DQMStore` before embarking on implementing concurrent booking in earnest:\r\n\r\n- Quite a bit of tidying using modern C++\r\n- Removing the global `IBooker`/`IGetter` global members of `DQMStore` in favor of creating local ones on the fly whenever transaction booking takes place\r\n- Improving the RAII usage\r\n\r\nThere was an uninitialized data member for one of the `DQMStore` constructors.  That has been fixed by relying on default-value (i.e. in-class) initialization, and by using a forwarding constructor.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 33, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1521040594", "deletions": 254, "labels": ["code-checks-pending", "comparison-pending", "dqm-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_1_X", "number": 22614, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "DQMStore cleanup in preparation for concurrent booking", "updated_at": "1521482717", "user": "knoepfel"}

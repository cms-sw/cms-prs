The HGCal digitizer has also been made to retain less memory, though peak usage is still about the same.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 46, "closed_at": "1476452986", "comments": 81, "commits": 15, "created_at": "1475098796", "deletions": 555, "labels": ["alca-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved", "urgent"], "merge_commit_sha": "d25d9586b50c3c670b921819db4f217f1dd56078", "merged_at": "1476452986", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 16022, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 23, "state": "closed", "title": "Introduce BH to HGCal Reconstruction workflows", "updated_at": "1476453102", "user": "lgray"}

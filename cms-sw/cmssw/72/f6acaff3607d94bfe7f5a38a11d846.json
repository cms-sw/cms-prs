Branching can be avoided by forcing the evaluation of both expressions, so a new function is introduced to accomplish this. Two cases found in #40611 are addressed.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nAbsence of jump instructions is confirmed via godbolt (see discussion in #40611). Code compiles.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nIntended to be backported to every open release since #40611 was merged.

This complicates the interface though, and has absolutely no impact on perf (less than ~0.01 s in initialization loop), hence did not go for that option.\r\n\r\n@civanch @cvuosalo @ianna ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1615617849", "comments": 8, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1615570057", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "eb3302bf11ef70dedaf67001c24a08463a78efca", "merged_at": "1615617849", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 33164, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix G4 logical volumes assignments to production cuts regions with DD4hep", "updated_at": "1615617849", "user": "ghugo83"}

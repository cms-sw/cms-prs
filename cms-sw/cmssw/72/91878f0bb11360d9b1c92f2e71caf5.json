The filtered list is fed into the jet reconstruction (akCs4PFJets), as well as the packed PF candidate collection.  The filtered out particles are stored in the following collection, which is stored in miniAOD\r\npatPackedCandidates_packedPFCandidatesCleaned__PAT\r\nThe slimmedMuons use both the kept and discarded packed candidates, as input.  \r\nDiscarded charged hadrons will end up in both packedPFCandidatesCleaned and lostTracks, but the cost of this double storage is small, as bad particles are rare.   \r\n\r\nDetails of the studies used to tune the selection cuts for bad particles may be found here:\r\nhttps://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/pub/CMS/HiHighPt2019/JetReco_MAN_291710.pdf\r\nhttps://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/pub/CMS/HiJetReco2019/JetReco_MAN_191010.pdf\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested with 140.5611\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore submitting your pull requests, make sure you followed this checklist:\r\n- verify that the PR is really intended for the chosen branch\r\n- verify that changes follow [CMS Naming, Coding, And Style Rules](http://cms-sw.github.io/cms_coding_rules.html)\r\n- verify that the PR passes the basic test procedure suggested in the [CMSSW PR instructions](https://cms-sw.github.io/PRWorkflow.html)\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 17, "closed_at": "1603299207", "comments": 163, "commits": 16, "created_at": "1601900154", "deletions": 19, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "operations-pending", "orp-approved", "pdmv-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved", "urgent"], "merge_commit_sha": "11c67e50f3cfbfb811435cd96cbcc7041a933ecc", "merged_at": "1603299207", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 31668, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 47, "state": "closed", "title": "Bad PF candidate filter for 2018 PbPb data", "updated_at": "1603889377", "user": "mandrenguyen"}

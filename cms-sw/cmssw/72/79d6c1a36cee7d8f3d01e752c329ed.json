Even after this PR is merged, it will still be possible for a stream to just run begin stream lumi and end stream lumi with no events. \r\n\r\nThis new behavior will be a performance improvement when one event takes a very long time to process. Before this PR, the stream processing that event cannot process any subsequent lumis and those lumis cannot complete until after the event completes. If the limit on the number of lumis is reached, all other work might become stuck until the slow event completes.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nAll pre-existing unit Core unit tests pass except for 2 (and those likely fail because of a lumi being skipped, the tests need an update probably). I wanted some feedback on this before devoting more time to testing.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "comments": 17, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1701976439", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["core-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "number": 43522, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 6, "state": "open", "title": "Allow a stream to skip a lumi if all events processed [RFC]", "updated_at": "1702573633", "user": "wddgit"}

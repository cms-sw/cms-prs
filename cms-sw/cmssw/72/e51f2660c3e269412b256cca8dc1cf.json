The effects are especially prominent if we compare MiniAOD with RECO, since the calculation of the PFJetID is done in slightly different ways, more details can be found in \nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/294180/contribution/4/material/slides/0.pdf\n\nslide 9 before the fix.\nslide 11 illustrates the feature \nslide 12 shows the expected agreement between RECO and MiniAOD formats, and the expected increase of the passFraction for forward Jets.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1417623193", "comments": 4, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1417543162", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "comparison-pending", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "aff9b85c90745f05f458c6bccaee36a4c2731c26", "merged_at": "1417623193", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 6744, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "fix in PFJetID calculation due to change in PFJet fraction calculation", "updated_at": "1417623194", "user": "webermat"}

This has been traced to be caused by fixed size arrays and hardcoded constants. In this PR we fix several of these instances with the goal of unblocking the usage of v19 geometry \r\n\r\n[1]  https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/47968\r\n[2] https://indico.cern.ch/event/1529650/contributions/6435641/attachments/3039546/5368577/Phase2-Talk146.pdf\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nLocally we have validated this so far with \r\n\r\n`runTheMatrix.py -l 34034.0`\r\n\r\nAt the time of pushing the PR we haven't however finished our tests and we would like to profit from the centralized CI/CD to spot additional uncovered failures.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 22, "comments": 2, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1749564583", "deletions": 50, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "l1-pending", "hlt-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 48287, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Fix crashes in HGCAL DIGI+ with v19 geometry", "updated_at": "1749564616", "user": "pfs"}

Migrate the existing phase1 tracking (Phase1PU70) to `trackingPhase1` era\n2. Update `trackingPhase1` era to the configuration in #13149, and move Phase1PU70-tracking to `trackingPhase1PU70` era\n\nTested in CMSSW_8_0_X_2016-02-11-2300, no changes expected.\n\n@rovere @VinInn \n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1455780250", "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1455284121", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 13266, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "[RFC] Add eras to select tracking configuration for 2017 detector", "updated_at": "1455786839", "user": "makortel"}

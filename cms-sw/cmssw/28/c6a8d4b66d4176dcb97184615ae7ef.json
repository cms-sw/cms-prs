Thus, the code has been restructured to facilitate future migration steps by DPGs.\r\nThe DT Geometry builder can be taken as an example.\r\n\r\n* EventSetup geometry-related records have been moved to a Geometry/Records package\r\n* Muon numbering related code has been moved to Geometry/MuonNumbering package\r\n\r\nNote for discussion: in order to keep both DD CMS and DD4hep based code in the same package the latter classes are placed as follows:\r\n```\r\nGeometry/MuonNumbering/interface/DD4hep_DTNumberingScheme.h\r\nGeometry/MuonNumbering/interface/DD4hep_MuonNumbering.h\r\n```\r\nAlternative suggestions are welcome.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe RelVal tests and the unit tests are run by default\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\n\r\nThere is no need to back-port it.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 28, "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1553183355", "deletions": 245, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-notrun", "geometry-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-rejected"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 26231, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "DD4hep: Merge Development to a Usual Geometry Structure", "updated_at": "1553247237", "user": "ianna"}

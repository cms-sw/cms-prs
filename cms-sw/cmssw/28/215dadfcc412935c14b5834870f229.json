It also adjust properly raw2digi module to the new hardware\r\nsettings for SAMPIC readout for PPS diamond sensors.\r\nThe bug was recently discovered and is a blocker for data readout and\r\nreconstruction in PPS, see for example crash reported here:\r\nhttps://cmsweb.cern.ch/dqm/dqm-square/tmp/tmp/content_parser_productionPARSER_run352682PARSER_job5.log\r\n\r\nThis patch is needed for PPS alignment run foreseen on 19 July 2022.\r\n\r\nThe PR can be tested locally using data from run 352682 available on EOS\r\n(`/eos/cms/store/t0streamer/Data/ExpressCosmics/000/352/682/`).\r\nThe test was based on standard PPS reconstruction.\r\n\r\nThe backport to 12_4 (and 12_3 if necessary) will follow shortly.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 1, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1654182457", "deletions": 10, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "alca-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-rejected"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 38208, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Fix for hardcoded subdetector id in PPS reconstruction code", "updated_at": "1654182856", "user": "ChrisMisan"}

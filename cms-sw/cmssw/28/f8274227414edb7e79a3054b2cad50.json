This causes problems with the `find()` function of the `edm::DataFrameContainer`, which only works for sorted detector IDs.\r\nSorting the collections produced by `EcalCPUDigisProducer` fixes this.\r\n\r\nThis also adds some code simplifications to `HLTEcalPhiSymFilter`, which is the module for which the issue manifested itself first.\r\n\r\nAddresses https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSHLT-2335\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe digis collection stored by `hltEcalPhiSymFilter` matches between CPU and GPU machines after sorting the collections.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 9, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1654872788", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "hlt-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 38321, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "ECAL - Sort digis collections coming from GPU unpacking", "updated_at": "1654930609", "user": "thomreis"}

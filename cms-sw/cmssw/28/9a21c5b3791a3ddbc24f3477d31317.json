Apply track-MTD quality matching criteria, using a cut on the MVA>0.5 corresponding to what was added in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/28815\r\nIf this criteria is not satisfied, the PFCandidate is not assigned a time (ie treated as though no timing information is available.)\r\n\r\n2.  Don't propagate timestamps from PFClusters to neutrals in the SimPFProducer (used for the realistic simcluster-based HGCal reconstruction) since this information is not reliable/consistently filled.  (Timing for neutral PFCandidates in HGCal is being revisited as part of migration to TICL-based reconstruction for PF.)\r\n\r\nThese changes should simplify downstream use of MTD timing information by POGs for phase 2 offline and HLT.\r\n\r\nSince the PFCandidate timestamps are not used downstream yet in any of the standard workflows, the expected change is only in the PFCandidate and PackedCandidate times and timeErrors, with a larger fraction of candidates having no timestamp assigned (and timeError = -1.0)\r\n\r\n@hatakeyamak @pmeridian @parbol @rovere @felicepantaleo \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1586499284", "comments": 22, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1585768867", "deletions": 14, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "d8ede6634f55c043c6d1d373b338c3929df79f2c", "merged_at": "1586499284", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 29374, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 4, "state": "closed", "title": "Restrict timestamps in PFCandidates to reliable cases", "updated_at": "1586499285", "user": "bendavid"}

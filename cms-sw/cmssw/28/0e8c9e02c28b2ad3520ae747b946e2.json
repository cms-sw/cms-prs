If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nThis PR is not a backport.  \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 10, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1738575108", "deletions": 206, "labels": ["core-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-rejected", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "ngt", "allow-rsreds"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_0_X", "number": 47248, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Extend edmEventSize to measure leaf sizes", "updated_at": "1738672861", "user": "rsreds"}

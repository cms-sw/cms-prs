Support for PhaseI and PhaseII has been added, more or less transparently. Currently the PhaseII workflow will fail with an assert, a clear indication that, once again, the material description for the PhaseII detector is still wrong (due to XML reg-exp search of elements being wrong). A fix is available, but not included in this PR, that would remain pure \"development\".\nAs a possible improvement, I'd suggest to run the few shell scripts that are included in this PR either while testing every PR or as part of every PreRelease validation: this would have spotted all the problems we had for PhaseI and still have for PhaseII immediately.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 41, "closed_at": "1476538761", "comments": 20, "commits": 58, "created_at": "1475754417", "deletions": 1470, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "102ea8d7d3295b756a554a797dd8c766165c9e6e", "merged_at": "1476538761", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 16116, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 7, "state": "closed", "title": "Improve reco material code", "updated_at": "1476538762", "user": "rovere"}

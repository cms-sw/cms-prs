Main improvements are\n- Remove dependence on event content of HLTMON stream (works even with AOD now)\n- Replace \"automatic configuration\" tool for selecting actual HLT paths with regular expressions explicitly specified in the python configuration\n- Consumes-API migration\n- Complete overhaul of histograms, e.g.\n  - Monitor tau efficiencies for each path, and for L2 and L3 separately\n  - Consistent trigger object - offline object (deltaR) matching in all relevant histograms\n  - Improve binning, axis labels etc.\n\nAlso the tau trigger release validation configurations have been updated to reflect these changes. The commits are rebased on top of CMSSW_7_0_0_pre4.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 36, "closed_at": "1380869376", "comments": 5, "commits": 52, "created_at": "1380264597", "deletions": 2947, "labels": ["dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "32022860542a7de3a95ee2f284ab782cbd0e9f09", "merged_at": "1380869376", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_0_0_pre6", "number": 937, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Update on tau trigger DQM tool", "updated_at": "1476951343", "user": "makortel"}

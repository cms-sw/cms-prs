This is intended to avoid to have the algorithm unintentionally broken as it happened recently with PR #28622.\r\nA new `MonitorElement`, `EventStats` is added to the module `SiStripGainsPCLWorker` to collect the number of events, tracks and clusters used by the calibration.\r\nThe content of this newly added ME is subsequently used to check in the new unit test `checkMultiRunHarvestingOutput` that the number of events effectively used coincides with the expectations. An hint is offered to the user in case it appears only the first run has been processed.\r\nThis PR is meant as a companion of the fix for the to the `EDMtoMEConverter` in #28934.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI tested this branch to fail (as expected) in `CMSSW_11_1_X_2020-02-18-2300` while it works correctly when merging commit 2972d1d0c46fc73dd65466834b1f5f0b4441775e locally. \r\nIt also passes `runTheMatrix.py -l 1001.0 -t 4 -j 8 --ibeos`.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nThis PR is not a backport and no backport is meant to be submitted.\r\n\r\n**N.B.:  This PR shall be tested together with #28934 to succeed integration tests.**\r\n\r\ncc:\r\n@schneiml @pieterdavid @robervalwalsh \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 9, "closed_at": "1582879238", "comments": 21, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1582100335", "deletions": 17, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "requires-external", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "081e2c8e428382515f610764d534ed5011bc4a0f", "merged_at": "1582879237", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 28994, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "SiStrip Gains Calibration: add unit test for Multi-Run Harvesting", "updated_at": "1582879238", "user": "mmusich"}

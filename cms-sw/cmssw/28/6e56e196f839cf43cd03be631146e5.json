It is the first step, and then we will need to update conditions.\r\nReported issue: https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/35707\r\n\r\nThis PR includes:\r\n- Era: Update Run3 era to include dd4hep, update Run3_dd4hep for compatibility, introduce new Run3_DDD for DDD workflow\r\n- Introduce .914 workflow for DDD\r\n- Update short matrix, exclude .912 (DD4hep DB) as it becomes default (.0) now. Add .914.\r\n- Update AutoCondModifiers to include all Run-3 autocond GT.\r\n\r\nAfter this PR,\r\n- When GT uses DD4hep by default, we will need to revisit AutoCondModifiers and change to DDD modifier instead.\r\n\r\nWhen GT migration is done, the migration should be transparent to all users. Nothing will change in cmsDriver. No need of `--procModifier`, no change in `--era` and `--condition `with autoCond GT.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n`runTheMatrix.py --what upgrade -l 11634.0,11634.911,11634.914 --wm init`\r\ngive proper configuration.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\nNo need of backport AFAIK.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 11, "comments": 33, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1634801182", "deletions": 42, "labels": ["simulation-pending", "alca-pending", "geometry-pending", "operations-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "number": 35761, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 7, "state": "open", "title": "Migration of DD4hep as default for all Run-3 workflow", "updated_at": "1634980004", "user": "srimanob"}

These are less-useful now that Xrootd reads\nfrom multiple servers (and possibly multiple sites) at a time!\n\nCurrently, this has to be enabled manually and only outputs\nto the FJR.  Long-term, we plan on adding additional statistics\nand additional output mechanisms (correcting the now-broken\nStatisticsSenderService reports we send to the Dashboard).\n\nNOTE: there is some trickery here due to the fact that the service\nregistry is only available on CMSSW-managed threads.  In order to\nmake the service available from the callback threads, the service\npointer is cached by the request manager object.\n```\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 8, "closed_at": "1423553682", "comments": 22, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1420574712", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "e6d70991cbdd3f51f9cdcc897b34574d7c2f51c5", "merged_at": "1423553682", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 7056, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 12, "state": "closed", "title": "Xrootd per site statistics", "updated_at": "1423553682", "user": "bbockelm"}

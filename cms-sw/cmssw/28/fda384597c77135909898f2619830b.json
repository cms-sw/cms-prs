Both should be tested together. \r\n- no changes to the output are expected. The alignment binaries written by  the new Mille version are 1:1 compatible to the existing format. \r\n- Documentation of changes / new features: [slides Alignment weekly 26.01.26)](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1628654/#49-millepede-ii-updates).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n- unit tests (`scram b runtests use-ibeos`): passing\r\n- `runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeo`: all tests passing except for few failures unrelated to the PR (missing datasets for e/gamma 136.X, DAS errors for 2022.00X-2025.00X)\r\n- alignment campaign with a local build of the modified CMSSW + externals: successful and identical output to existing codebase.  \r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

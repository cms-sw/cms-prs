Before this information was only available by calling `SoA::ParametersTypeOf_COLOMNNAME`. This means it was only available by name and it was not possible to iterate over this information.\r\n\r\nAlso at the moment the  `ConstDescriptor` and the `Descriptor`-struct hold colomn information wrapped in `std::span`, where for example the `scalar`-type information of `Eigen`-objects is extracted. This means it is not possible to get back to the original `Eigen`-object that is defined as `SOA_COLOMN`. The information like the number of rows can not be obtained in this way.\r\n\r\nTo the PR a SoA copy example is added as test case, which copies two smaller Collections to a larger one. The idea for the copy method, which unrolls the colomns of the SoA at compile time, is taken from [SiPixelRecHitExtendedAlpaka](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/RecoLocalTracker/SiPixelRecHits/plugins/alpaka/SiPixelRecHitExtendedAlpaka.cc)\r\n\r\n**If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

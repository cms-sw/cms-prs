This is because the function, under certain conditions, does a shallow copy (It is poorly named).  The pointer is never used to modify any member.\nThis pull request (for thread safety) changes the function to return a pointer to const, and propagates the const qualifier through another package so that everything compiles.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1383672528", "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1383670791", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["alca-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_7_0_0_pre8", "number": 1339, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "Const function must return const ptr for thread safety", "updated_at": "1406907290", "user": "wmtan"}

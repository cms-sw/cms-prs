Recently, PR updating TP algorithm to recover a saturation threshold for HE with |ieta| >= 21 in PR #37196 was submitted. However, we want the PR #37196 to be reverted since it is not yet implemented in f/w and we need matches between s/w and f/w in production release now. The comparison between recontructed TP energy with MAHI rechit energy was performed and can be found in this [slide](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/files/8422269/Comnissioning_1TS_Scheme_22Apr06.pdf). The problem of the sharp cutoff at 64 GeV in HE(|ieta| >= 21) is well understood now, and TP algorithm will be updated both in f/w and s/w to recover the same TP energy threshold of 128 GeV in HE(|ieta| >= 21) in later PR. \r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nA basic technical test was performed in CMSSW_12_3_X_2022-04-05-1100 : runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nThis PR is a backport of PR #37471 to 123X, as we need matches between s/w and f/w in production release now. \r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1649193322", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["l1-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 37472, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[Backport of] HCAL: fix on HCAL TP saturation algorithm to synchronize s/w TP algorithm with f/w", "updated_at": "1649253873", "user": "TaeunKwon"}

It can happen to loopers . In this case an exception was thrown in linking . NOw we link those specific  tracks as well but only using  the first point they did hit ignoring the exit point . Ignoring the exit point just results in more strict linking which doesnt really matter because those are really low pt tracks.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1452774471", "comments": 10, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1452693830", "deletions": 9, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "64dda6561fdb81b20262ec26bae5fd536a83f1ef", "merged_at": "1452774471", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 12930, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix issue with weird linking case crashing reprocessing", "updated_at": "1452774471", "user": "bachtis"}

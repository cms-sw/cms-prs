This means it is limited to a size of 10MB. There are histograms which are bigger than this (specifically HLT paths vs bx) and thus can exceed this limit and crash the client. We encountered this when running the full menu of 800+ paths.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nDQM team report successful playback\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nbackport of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/38112\r\n\r\nneeded for P5 DQM release series (aka 12_3, 12_4)", "branch": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 3, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1653917857", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "backport-ok"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 38122, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Fixing Memory Coruption for large histograms in DQMFileSaverPB : 12_3_X", "updated_at": "1653920360", "user": "Sam-Harper"}

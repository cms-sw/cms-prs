The reason for the failure was that `customiseForRunI()` was not migrated to the new reco sequence structure introduced.\n\nI also added the traceback to the error report in `RunExpressProcessing.py`, because without it I had no clue what was going wrong (in case somebody else has to debug similar stuff later).\n\nTested in CMSSW_8_0_X_2015-12-09-1600, no other changes expected.\n\n@rovere @VinInn \n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1449730031", "comments": 6, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1449688399", "deletions": 7, "labels": ["comparison-available", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "5646d94f42265ab792f141017b758468cddc88e9", "merged_at": "1449730031", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 12730, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix customiseForRunI for tracking-only reco sequence", "updated_at": "1476957020", "user": "makortel"}

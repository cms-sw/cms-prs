For nearly all changes I ran a recursive search-replace.\r\n\r\nI renamed `CSCCLCTData` in `EventFilter/CSCRawToDigi` to `CSCComparatorData`, because it does not actually contain the CLCTs. It only contains comparator digis. In fact, CLCTs are kept in `CSCTMBHeader`\r\n\r\nI removed `CSCComparatorDigiFitter` in `L1Trigger/CSCTriggerPrimitives`. It was originally meant to be used in the CLCT processor, but it was never properly integrated, and the CCLUT algorithm will be doing that in the near future (see various PRs with tag `CCLUT`).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles. Tested with WF 26634.0.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nN/A", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 91, "closed_at": "1589286506", "comments": 21, "commits": 12, "created_at": "1588949302", "deletions": 3490, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-pending", "l1-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 29782, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 4, "state": "closed", "title": "CMS code rules for CSC digi and trigger objects", "updated_at": "1589286506", "user": "dildick"}

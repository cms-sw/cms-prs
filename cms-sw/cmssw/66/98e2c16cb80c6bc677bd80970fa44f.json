Instead, they only stored such arrays as if they were one dimensional\nequal to the first dimension. In this case, only the first 4 array elements\nwere ever stored. With versions 5.34.20 and beyond this was fixed, however\nit means the data stored in the conditions database is no longer readable.\nChanging HcalCholeskyMatrix to match what ROOT did in the old versions allows\nus to read the old data. If a value outside of the stored range is requested,\nthe code returns the value of 0 which matches the old behavior.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_2_DEVEL_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1411324122", "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1411320328", "deletions": 16, "labels": ["alca-pending", "comparison-pending", "db-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "c8badec6fae609a79e0afc864b338a8a3e91c820", "merged_at": "1411324122", "merged_by": "davidlt", "number": 5460, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Make HcalCholeskyMatrix compatible with new ROOT", "updated_at": "1440592790", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

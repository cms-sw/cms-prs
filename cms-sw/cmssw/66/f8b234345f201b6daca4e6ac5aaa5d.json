Such a functionality is needed in the GPU pixel tracking work. Because the change implies recompiling ~half of the universe, I submit it here already now so that we could benefit getting it to a CMSSW pre-release (thus avoiding the aforementioned private recompilation).\r\n\r\n~~The \"copying\" is implemented as the following pattern~~\r\n~~`edmNew::DetSetVector<T> copy;`~~\r\n~~`copy.replaceFrom(original);`~~\r\n~~to allow putting the the `copy` to an `std::unique_ptr<T>`, and still keeping the copy constructor and assignment operator disabled (to prevent accidental copies).~~\r\n\r\nTested in 10_2_0_pre3, no changes expected.\r\n\r\n@fwyzard @felicepantaleo @VinInn ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 36, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1527242974", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 23333, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "open", "title": "Add copy constructor to edmNew::DetSetVector", "updated_at": "1527523441", "user": "makortel"}

There are caveats, of course, and you should not expect to have **exactly** the same reconstruction code that we had in 53.\n- All the architectural changes have been kept, like the sane usage of EDProducers instead of the insane use of ES quantities.\n- In general all C++ related changes have been kept\n- JetCore iteration and ClusterSplitting have been removed\n- The order of the iterations has been restored\n- The Muon specific iterations have been kept but, if you want, you can use the `earlyGeneralTracks` that are produced **before** running these iterations\n- The usage of MVA has been disabled and the old selector cuts have been restored, taken from 5_3_27 (module human errors in diff-ing configuration files)\n- PixelVertices and PixelTracks have been both restored\n\nIn order to use the Run1-like tracking, please either add:\n\n```\n--customise RecoTracker/Configuration/customiseForRunI.customiseForRunI\n```\n\nto `cmsDriver.py` command, or:\n\n```\nfrom RecoTracker.Configuration.customiseForRunI import customiseForRunI\n\n#call to customisation function customiseForRunI imported from RecoTracker.Configuration.customiseForRunI\nprocess = customiseForRunI(process)\n```\n\ndirectly into your final python configuration file.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 8, "closed_at": "1429529260", "comments": 10, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1428590472", "deletions": 115, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "02f85a6595da92c227fcccaa19186c4d8bd84d65", "merged_at": "1429529260", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 8691, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 5, "state": "closed", "title": "Run 1 reco tuning", "updated_at": "1429529260", "user": "rovere"}

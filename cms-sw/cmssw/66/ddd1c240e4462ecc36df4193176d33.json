It functions as both a global tagger and a mass regression model for AK8 jets and can also be utilized as a pre-trained model. The hidden layer neurons (with dimension 256) are stored in MiniAOD, providing the capability to resume all output scores. Further details can be found in the slides.\r\n\r\nIn summary, the integration overview (the new AK8 jet features added to MiniAOD and NanoAOD) is illustrated below.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"600\" alt=\"glopart-integration\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b33106e5-eafd-41b7-b510-1ce9830c212c\">\r\n\r\nPlease test this PR with https://github.com/cms-data/RecoBTag-Combined/pull/62.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n - The PR passes the unit test `test_globalpart_cfg.py` and is also validated under the AODSIM->MINIAOD->NANOAOD workflow.\r\n - Profiling performance in cmssw is delivered and shown in the slides above (see pp.89-93).\r\n - The output scores produced via ONNX in the cmssw workflow are validated to match those in the PyTorch workflow.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 12, "comments": 28, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1730101880", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "requires-external", "code-checks-approved", "xpog-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_2_X", "number": 46523, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 6, "state": "open", "title": "Add GloParT inference facility", "updated_at": "1730493275", "user": "colizz"}

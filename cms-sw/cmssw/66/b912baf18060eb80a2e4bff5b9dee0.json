This pattern is repeated for all the plugins. I would suggest to simplify this by having the plugins all inherit from `EcalClusterFunctionBaseClass` directly. Like this, the `RecoEcal/EgammaCoreTools/plugins` directory looks radically simpler and it would really help for understanding the code and future refactors. For example, one can now just do `git grep EcalClusterFunctionBaseClass` to find all the plugins that inherit from it. This PR doesn't make any actual changes to the code, it just reshuffles some lines.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCMSSW complies and local matrix tests pass.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\n\r\nNo backport intended.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 33, "closed_at": "1573287531", "comments": 23, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1572617920", "deletions": 1054, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "1c116f60f74cd7edb26d4c67b82da009ec38f866", "merged_at": "1573287531", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 28332, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 14, "state": "closed", "title": "Simplify inheritance hirachy of EcalClusterFunctions", "updated_at": "1573287531", "user": "guitargeek"}

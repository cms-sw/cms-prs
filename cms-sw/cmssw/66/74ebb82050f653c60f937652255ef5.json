In a similar way, the offset with pixel detectors is used to properly display the tomography. \r\n- Updated tests to cope with PR 22264", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 13, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1520167229", "deletions": 117, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "dqm-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-started"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_1_X", "number": 22447, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "CTPPS: updated DQM for 2018 data taking", "updated_at": "1520261715", "user": "nminafra"}

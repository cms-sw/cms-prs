In a similar way, the offset with pixel detectors is used to properly display the tomography. \r\n- Updated tests to cope with PR 22264", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1522765101", "comments": 40, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1520167229", "deletions": 117, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "72f31aee93eae8165de78c5623b3d9d3a3b512eb", "merged_at": "1522765101", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 22447, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "CTPPS: updated DQM for 2018 data taking", "updated_at": "1522765101", "user": "nminafra"}

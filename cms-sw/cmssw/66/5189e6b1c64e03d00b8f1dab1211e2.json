This bug led to failures in a few RelVals [*] after the integration of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/43300 (first HLT menus using the buggy plugin).\r\n>\r\n>The issue is that in\r\n>https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/9e9d289e9d02ac5302347670783e608f8d12179e/HLTrigger/JetMET/plugins/HLTL1TMatchedJetsVBFFilter.h#L174\r\n>`jetIndices.size() - 1` is converted to `unsigned int`, so it becomes `(uint) -1` (i.e. `4294967295`), which is unintended.\r\n>\r\n>In this particular case, it is sufficient to remove the `-1` in the loop range: this removes the bug, and does not change the overall behaviour of the plugin. (The extra cost of the additional iteration when `size > 0` is mostly likely minuscule.)\r\n>\r\n>To be backported down to `13_2_X` (where the buggy plugin was introduced).\r\n>\r\n>Merely technical. No changes expected.\r\n>\r\n>[*] RelVals with seg-faults in `CMSSW_14_0_X_2023-11-17-2300` and `CMSSW_13_3_X_2023-11-17-2300`\r\n>```\r\n>141.001,141.008,141.008505,141.008511,141.008521,141.11,141.112\r\n>```\r\n>These RelVals did not fail in `CMSSW_13_2_X_2023-11-17-2300`, because in that cycle the same RelVals use the frozen HLT menu \"2023-v1.2\" (which has not changed recently, and does not use the buggy plugin).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nNone beyond the check done for #43324.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

No physics change expected.\r\nIt cleans up 2 things:\r\n1) Phase2 EGM HLT moved from TICL V3 to V4 some time ago (https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/39820). But some remnants of TICL V3 had remained in EGM configs, which I did not notice before. Removing them now.  \r\n2) Removing the obsolete and unmaintainable config `RecoEgamma/EgammaHLTProducers/python/HLTEgPhaseIITestSequence_cff.py`. It was useful when it was introduced (in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/32519), as it allowed to test Phase2 specific code which was being used only in HLT, which was otherwise not testable as the Phase2 HLT menu was not part of CMSSW at that time. Now that we have the Phase2 HLT menu in release, there is no point of having this additional Egamma Phase2 HLT config, which anyway became obsolete very quickly.

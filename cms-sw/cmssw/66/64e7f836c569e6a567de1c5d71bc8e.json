Motivation for this PR is to avoid further wait for the fix in ROOT to be merged and backported to 6.14 (if the backport ever happens) in the production jobs that are stuck in this problem.\r\n\r\nResolves #33361 (really works around it), resolves https://github.com/makortel/framework/issues/139 .\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nFramework unit tests run. Example case in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/33361 does not terminate in an exception, and the printout is visible.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nIntentionally submitted to 10_6_X only.

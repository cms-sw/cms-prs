The reconstruction sequence is modified to run these producers and keep them in the output. There is a fix in the BuildFile for the issue discussed here:\nhttps://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/14862#issuecomment-226190302\nThese producers were initially developed and tested for PbPb collisions and pp collisions with HI reconstruction in MB and dijet embedded samples in CMSSW_7_5_8_patch3, here are some links to validation plots:\nhttps://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/pub/CMS/HiJetReco2015/160317_RCPeripheralCorr.pdf\nhttps://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/pub/CMS/HiJetReco2015/160317_RCPeripheralCorr.pdf\nIn pp collisions a small dijet sample was produced with 112 option of the matrix with additional customizations for pPb to test the producers in CMSSW_8_1_X with pp reconstruction.\nWe would like to merge it to the IB in order to use it for 2016 pPb runs planned to be reconstructed with CMSSW_8_0, and future PbPb runs.\n\n@mverwe @mandrenguyen @yetkinyilmaz\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 8, "closed_at": "1468935827", "comments": 24, "commits": 8, "created_at": "1466968898", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-rejected"], "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 14985, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 8, "state": "closed", "title": "rho analyzer and empty area correction added to customize", "updated_at": "1468935827", "user": "dgulhan"}

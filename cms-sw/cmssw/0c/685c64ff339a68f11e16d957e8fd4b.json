This is motivated by the noticeable improvement reported in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/38339. Since the number of photon xml files are much smaller than electron, it could very well be that the improvement brought in by this PR won't be as noticeable. But I'm curious to see the effect of this PR, taking advantage of the profiling options of the bot. If the improvement is negligible, then.. oh well. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nTested with workflow `11834.21`.\r\n\r\nThis PR is not a backport.\r\nBackport not necessary.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1656509472", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "requires-external", "code-checks-approved", "egamma"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 38556, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[EGM MVA ID] xml.gz to root conversion for photons", "updated_at": "1657189272", "user": "swagata87"}

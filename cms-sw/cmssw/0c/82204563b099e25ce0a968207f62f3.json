The solution to recover the b-tagging performance when using CS jets was to use instead the unsubtracted particles in the b-tag info producers.\r\n\r\nSo this PR implements a jet matcher by deltaR that allows to match CS jet collections to unsubtracted jet collections and creates an association map between these two collections. This map is then later added to the Deep Boosted, Deep Flavour and the Particle Transformer tag info producers to access the unsubtracted jet associated to the CS jet and use the unsubtrated particles instead. The logic is defined such that if the map is not provided (default behavior), the particles of the input jet collection is always used as currently done.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis PR was validated in CMSSW_13_2_10 using a TTbar sample.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

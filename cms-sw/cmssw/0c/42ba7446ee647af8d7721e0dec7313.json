This allows us to start building an ME0 local trigger.\r\n* ME0 strip/pad digi is similar to GEM strip/pad digi. \r\n* ME0PadDigi is a fat digi built from ME0DigiPreReco for now. This will change in the future\r\n* ME0TriggerDigi is a trimmed down version of CSCCorrelatedLCTDigi. Also this may change in the future.\r\n* A skeleton ME0 TMB was implemented to build ME0TriggerDigi from ME0PadDigi\r\n* There should be no differences in the standard tests since no existing producers were modified. No new producers were enabled in the standard DIGI chain.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 29, "closed_at": "1493020428", "comments": 47, "commits": 24, "created_at": "1491430599", "deletions": 10, "labels": ["comparison-available", "l1-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "f3357ba5c7ad89ba01988c94c0a95ba368a222b6", "merged_at": "1493020428", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_1_X", "number": 18229, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 32, "state": "closed", "title": "Realistic ME0 digi and stub data formats; skeleton ME0 local trigger", "updated_at": "1493393217", "user": "dildick"}

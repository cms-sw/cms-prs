That efficiency drop was traced to [PR47160](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/47160) which includes changes in the RPC geometry for Run 4.\r\n\r\nWe have found one (unintentional) change in the modified RPC geometry (v4) used by [PR47160](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/47160) that we suspect is the cause. This is the reverse rotation direction on RE4 Ring2&3 (RTXURTXUR), which we believe could potentially cause a mismatch. Therefore, we propose to roll back the rotation direction to the same as in v3, while keeping the other changes.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces:\r\n1. Modified RPC Endcap geometry version 2030/v6/rpcf.xml\r\n- Based on the existing v4 definitions\r\n- Revert RE4 Ring2&3 chamber rotations (same as v3):\r\n```xml\r\n<!-- before -->\r\n<String name=\"ChildName\" value=\"RTXUR\"/>\r\n<!-- after -->\r\n<String name=\"ChildName\" value=\"RTXU\"/>\r\n```\r\n- No other elements from v4 are changed (i.e. not a full rollback to v3)\r\n\r\n2. Update Run 4 scenarios to use v6\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected impact:\r\n- Restores L1 muon matching efficiency in Phase 2 endcap (RECO/GEN matching) without affecting any other detector geometry or reconstruction.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n- Geometry overlap checks: no new overlaps detected.\r\n- Local runTheMatrix.py: no issues detected.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nNot a backport, Nothing special\r\n\r\n@bsunanda @jhgoh @mrcthiel @mileva\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 52, "comments": 5, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1747815058", "deletions": 53, "labels": ["geometry-rejected", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 48136, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Modify All Run4 scenarios to include modified RPC geometry", "updated_at": "1747824702", "user": "eigen1907"}

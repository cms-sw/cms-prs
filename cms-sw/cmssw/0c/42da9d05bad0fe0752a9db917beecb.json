This is replaced by using the new ModuleCallingContext.\nThere should be no change in behavior. The only interface change\nin the HLTrigger code is that the Event is an added argument\nto some functions. These functions are only used in a few\nplaces and all uses are fixed. Also in the Framework, the\nPlaceInPathContext class is added and used. Removed the unused\nfilling of TriggerResults for end paths. Some other minor\nFramework cleanup and unit tests.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 29, "closed_at": "1377175734", "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1377011243", "deletions": 156, "labels": ["core-approved", "fully-signed", "hlt-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "e71fbd93f2ff343146506840e7270554f8dc44bb", "merged_at": "1377175734", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_0_0_pre3", "number": 576, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Remove CurrentProcessingContext from HLTrigger", "updated_at": "1403401494", "user": "wddgit"}

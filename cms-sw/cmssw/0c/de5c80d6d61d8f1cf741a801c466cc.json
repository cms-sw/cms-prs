There updates are used in MTD-related developments.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles and runs, if activated. The update in \"SimG4Core/Notification\" is needed to get the code compiling, since the original version produces:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/gpfs/cms/users/cossutti/Timing/digi/CMSSW_13_0_0_pre4/src/SimG4Core/Notification/src/SimTrackManager.cc: In member function 'void SimTrackManager::cleanTracksWithHistory()':\r\n/gpfs/cms/users/cossutti/Timing/digi/CMSSW_13_0_0_pre4/src/SimG4Core/Notification/src/SimTrackManager.cc:344:23: error: expected ';' before '<' token\r\n  344 |   for (unsigned int it < (*m_trksForThisEvent).size(); ++it) {\r\n      |                       ^~\r\n      |                       ;\r\n/gpfs/cms/users/cossutti/Timing/digi/CMSSW_13_0_0_pre4/src/SimG4Core/Notification/src/SimTrackManager.cc:344:24: error: expected primary-expression before '<' token\r\n  344 |   for (unsigned int it < (*m_trksForThisEvent).size(); ++it) {\r\n      |                        ^\r\ngmake: *** [config/SCRAM/GMake/Makefile.rules:1740: tmp/el8_amd64_gcc11/src/SimG4Core/Notification/src/SimG4CoreNotification/SimTrackManager.cc.o] Error 1\r\ngmake: *** [There are compilation/build errors.

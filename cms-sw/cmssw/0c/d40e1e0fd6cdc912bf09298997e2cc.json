This PR changes the JME scouting DQM (`jetMETDQMOfflineSourceScouting`) to use Task. In this way the crashing module (`ak4PFScoutingL1FastjetCorrector`) will run only when requested by the JME scouting module (`jetDQMAnalyzerSequenceScouting`), ie. when scouting objects exists. In this way we avoid the crash.\r\nNote-2: `egmGsfElectronIDsForScoutingDQM` will use `gedGsfElectrons` instead of `slimmedElectrons` to be compatible with RECO without AOD (cc @tihsu99)\r\n\r\nThis PR simply adds scouting DQM to the trigger DQM sequence. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI'm having some problems with the validation (https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/49331). I would like to check that all corner cases are covered (in particular I suspect that a re-reco of a non-scouting dataset might have problems)\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nTo be defined\r\n\r\n(previous attempts #49350  #49336)\r\n\r\nFYI @patinkaew @etzovara @cms-sw/hlt-l2 with the fix in the JME DQM scouting sequence we might not need anymore of the customization function https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/49084 . Using Task, the crashing module does not run in events without scouting objects", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 3, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1762789118", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_0_X", "number": 49358, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": " Run Scouting DQM in RelVals (+ change in JME scouting DQM sequence)", "updated_at": "1762789287", "user": "silviodonato"}

This PR changes the JME scouting DQM (`jetMETDQMOfflineSourceScouting`) to use Task. In this way the crashing module (`ak4PFScoutingL1FastjetCorrector`) will run only when requested by the JME scouting module (`jetDQMAnalyzerSequenceScouting`), ie. when scouting objects exists. In this way we avoid the crash (cc @etzovara).\r\nNote-2: `egmGsfElectronIDsForScoutingDQM` will use `gedGsfElectrons` instead of `slimmedElectrons` to be compatible with RECO without AOD (cc @tihsu99)\r\n\r\nThis PR simply adds scouting DQM to the trigger DQM sequence. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI'm having some problems with the validation (https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/49331). I would like to check that all corner cases are covered (in particular I suspect that a re-reco of a non-scouting dataset might have problems)\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

It is fixed now. \n\nThe threshold of 1e-6 has been modified to zero too.\nAutomatically ported from CMSSW_7_4_X #7674\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 0, "closed_at": "1426231999", "comments": 6, "commits": 0, "created_at": "1424172242", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "generators-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "967472dabfb5ffd4f9f9544173e50e14ec40afe8", "merged_at": "1426231999", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 7788, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Change the way total cross section is computed in GenXSecAnalzyer and fix the print out in LHERunInfo.cc", "updated_at": "1426231999", "user": "cmsbuild"}

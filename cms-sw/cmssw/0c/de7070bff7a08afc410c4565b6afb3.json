Now we setup to have the UnscheduledProductResolver have direct access to the Worker and therefore invoke it directly without any lookup or extra virtual calls.\nThis refactoring is needed for work to allow asynchronous calling of unscheduled EDProducers.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 20, "closed_at": "1460781583", "comments": 22, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1460655560", "deletions": 255, "labels": ["comparison-available", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "68e7b629abae5f4561f9180f14208b0c12d6a0bb", "merged_at": "1460781583", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 14081, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Streamline calling of unscheduled EDProducers", "updated_at": "1463138368", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

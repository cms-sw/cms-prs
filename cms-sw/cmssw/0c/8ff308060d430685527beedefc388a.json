The aim is to increase the trigger efficiency and cut down on the rates by using the GEM or RPC hits as substitutes for missing ALCTs or CLCTs. \n\nAdditions/modifications to code:\n- ME1/1: enabled in 2023Muon upgrade scenario\n  <br>ALCT-GEM stubs with high quality and straight pattern in ME1/a and ME1/b\n  <br>ALCT-CLCT-GEM stubs with with high quality in ME1/a and ME1/b\n- ME2/1: enabled in 2023Muon upgrade scenario\n  <br>ALCT-GEM stubs with high quality and straight pattern \n  <br>ALCT-CLCT-GEM stubs with with high quality\n- ME3/1-ME4/1: Not enabled yet\n  <br>First version of CSC-RPC local integrated trigger. \n  <br>ALCT-CLCT-RPC stubs with with high quality \n\nTo be done (not urgent)\n- Enable LCT ghost busting algorithms. Should see a small improvement in the CSCTF efficiency\n- Debug new integrated LCT dataformat and transmission to CSCTF\n- Clean-up sort functions in ME11\n- Hide LUTs for GEM-CSC-RPC matching in the geometry helper class\n- Implement CSC-RPC bending angle\n- Clean-up debug statements\n- Develop integrated GEM-CLCT trigger patterns\n", "branch": "CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "changed_files": 34, "closed_at": "1398416884", "comments": 7, "commits": 47, "created_at": "1398171645", "deletions": 505, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "generators-pending", "l1-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "77b0f6c340afd06b7c119f89cdb470f052bd18bd", "merged_at": "1398416884", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "number": 3432, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "GEM-CSC-RPC integrated local trigger update", "updated_at": "1404804293", "user": "dildick"}

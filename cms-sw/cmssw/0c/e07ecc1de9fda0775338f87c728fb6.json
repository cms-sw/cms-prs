This means it is limited to a size of 10MB. There are histograms which are bigger than this (specifically HLT paths vs bx) and thus can exceed this limit and crash the client. We encountered this when running the full menu of 800+ paths.\r\n\r\nThis PR moves it to the heap.  Feel free to use a different preferred way of doing it. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe firstCollisions v2.0 no longer crashes the P5 DQM workflow when done offline. Further validation to be done by the DQM group. \r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 7, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1653751333", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 38112, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Fixing Memory Coruption for large histograms in DQMFileSaverPB", "updated_at": "1653755995", "user": "Sam-Harper"}

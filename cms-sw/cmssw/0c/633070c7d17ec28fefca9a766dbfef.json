This have been created after in pull request #48678 the tests that were manually analyzing that the values introduced by the writer are the same ones as returned to tester. The tests defined for this one are instead more generalized, where we want to print the result and check that the number of fields for CondFormats/RunInfo/interface/LHCInfoPerFill.h is correspondent to the number of lines from the print. \r\n\r\nThe number for assertion for the testcase in writer (one analyzed) for PerFill is 31 lines, due to the print of both the IOV and the line *LHCInfoPerFill retrieved:\\n* \" with the content for  **\"CondFormats/RunInfo/interface/LHCInfoPerFill.h\"** for the specific case.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile for PerLS the number of lines is 2 as we test the csv format\r\n\r\nThe PR is also related to issue [ts-coordination#26](https://gitlab.cern.ch/cms-ppd/technical-support/ts-coordination/-/issues/56)\r\n\r\nAlso the test is named in BuildFile.xml\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nFor validation, the tests were run, where the values that are inserted are through writer and obtained later from the SQLite file that is created. The results were working.\r\n\r\nThe number of lines requested was modified (as to test if it produced a mistake) to confirm that the exceptions were handled correctly for both files, which produces an output like this):\r\n\r\n\r\n## Failure Test Case For PerFill:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[asalgado@lxplus976 test]$ /bin/sh ./test_lhcInfo_analyzer.sh\r\nBegin processing the 1st record.

This contains code which is TTree/RNTuple agnostic.\r\n- Moved storage related code out of FWCore/Services to FWStorage/Services to better isolate external dependencies.\r\n\r\nThis work is based on the discussion here https://github.com/cms-sw/framework-team/issues/1256#issuecomment-3617363107\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nFramework tests mostly work. The ones that fail are because of an incompatibility between CMS partial builds and how ROOT handles its rootmap files. When ROOT parses the rootmap files,  it lumps all lib*.so files from different directories into the same list and complains if there are overlaps. Therefore if we move a dictionary from one package to a different one, ROOT will see both placements, one in the user work area and the other coming from the CMSSW release area. Scram avoids this problem by taking into account LD_LIBRARY_PATH ordering but ROOT does not appear to do that.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 188, "comments": 11, "commits": 9, "created_at": "1765382648", "deletions": 261, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "core-pending", "alca-pending", "generators-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "new-package-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-pending", "changes-dataformats"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_0_X", "number": 49594, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Moved storage related code to FWStorage subsystem", "updated_at": "1765386628", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

It shouldn't impact Run2 and Run3 reconstruction, but improves phase2 reconstruction. Before this PR, tracks and HF clusters in |eta|=3-4 region have been heavily double-counting charged particles in this region, which will be largely remedied in this PR. This PR introduces kdtree-based linking between tracks and HF clusters, and links are utilized in mostly createCandidatesHF of PFAlgo.\r\n\r\nAlso, the propagator is fixed to make the track propagation to HF to work for particles with pt<3 GeV also (which was broken in the past, as it didn't matter).\r\n\r\nAlso, the HF face is updated to be in agreement with the actual geometry.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nSee the original PR #28442 \r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\n\r\nThis is a backport of #28442 \r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "changed_files": 35, "closed_at": "1576786071", "comments": 14, "commits": 33, "created_at": "1576688994", "deletions": 250, "labels": ["backport-ok", "comparison-available", "fastsim-pending", "hlt-approved", "orp-approved", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "2947757f7fae8205c2f010dc596b0cafff4f9921", "merged_at": "1576786071", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 28650, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "(Backport) PFlow in the HF region for phase2", "updated_at": "1576786072", "user": "hatakeyamak"}

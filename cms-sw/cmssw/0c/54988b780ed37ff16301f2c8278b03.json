The purpose of this association is to map from `uint32_t`-type keys (\"ones\") to a set of associated object of templated type `index_type = I` (\"many\"). \r\nHowever, in two of the functions, the input `b` (which corresponds to a \"one\") is has the wrong type `I` instead of `uint32_t`.\r\n\r\nThis bug limits the type `I` of the \"many\" that can be stored by the association to integer-types as the code of the function does not compile otherwise. As far as I can tell this issue was never discovered since all the applications that are currently in release associate integers to integers.\r\n\r\nNo changes in the output are expected.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nFor validation, I ran `scram b runtests` in `HeterogeneousCore/AlpakaInterface` to verify the CUDA and serial backends. I also ran the alpaka pixel tracking in HLT Phase-2 (which uses these associations) and checked that the output is identical.\r\n\r\nFor a validation at larger scale, I think the usual PR tests should be sufficient.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 10, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1769699040", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "tests-rejected", "orp-pending", "bug-fix", "code-checks-approved", "heterogeneous-pending", "ngt"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_1_X", "number": 49975, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Fix function input type in the OneToManyAssoc of the alpaka interface", "updated_at": "1770025282", "user": "JanGerritSchulz"}

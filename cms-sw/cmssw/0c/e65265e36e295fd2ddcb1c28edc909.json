However, `EventSetup::get` has been deprecated in favor of methods that take `ESGetToken` as an argument, such as `EventSetup::getHandle`. As a result, `GEMCSCSegment` reconstruction throws `MustUseESGetToken` exception. Therefore, this PR migrates to using `EventSetup` with `ESGetToken`.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nThe GEMCSCSegment reconstruction is not included in RECO. So, we can't verify this PR with any wf. So, I added it to step3 of 11850.0 for testing and ran [RecoLocalMuon/GEMCSCSegment/test/TestGEMCSCSegmentAnalyzer.cc](https://github.com/seungjin-yang/cmssw/blob/Fix-GEMCSCSegmentProducer-Geometry-Loading__from-CMSSW_12_3_0_pre2/RecoLocalMuon/GEMCSCSegment/test/TestGEMCSCSegmentAnalyzer.cc).

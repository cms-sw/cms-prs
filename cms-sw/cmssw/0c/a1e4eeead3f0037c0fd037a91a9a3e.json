We had to move the top-tagging algorithms and dataformats from AnalysisDataFormats/TopObjects and TopQuarkAnalysis/TopPairBSM into RECO-accessible packages, DataFormats/JetReco, RecoJets/JetProducers and RecoJets/JetAlgorithms.\n2. Currently only a few jet collections are being monitored, AK5, AK5CHS, CA8, CA8 pruned, and CA8 top tagged. more to follow. \n\nSo I think we've now required 8 people to sign off on these changes. Sorry ;). \n\nCheers,\nSal and Maral\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 15, "closed_at": "1383219916", "comments": 10, "commits": 8, "created_at": "1382630554", "deletions": 36, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "37d3a1f3c4f933e8c2107d798cd8e12c68940102", "merged_at": "1383219916", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_0_0_pre8", "number": 1170, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Adding first implementation of the B2G DQM Modules", "updated_at": "1389115679", "user": "rappoccio"}

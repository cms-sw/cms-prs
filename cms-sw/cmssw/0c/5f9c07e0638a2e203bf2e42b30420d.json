This is not in itself a bug, because the analogous Reflex function did the same.  However,the conditions  code as written for ROOT6 assumes that the original type will be returned if the type is not an array or a pointer.  The easiest way to fix this for now is to have toType() return the original type.\n2) The conditions code assumed incorrectly that TypeWithDict::size() returns the number of elements in the array if the type is an array.  It does not. The correct function to call is TypeWithDict::arrayLength().\nThis pull request changes the call to use arrayLength().\nPlease merge this promptly unless there are problems.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_ROOT6_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1393675605", "comments": 1, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1393624215", "deletions": 7, "labels": ["core-pending", "db-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "ac9c32d9ea72ec29cf43635efe23b10f1a505aa3", "merged_at": "1393675605", "merged_by": "ktf", "number": 2682, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Two more root6 relval fixes", "updated_at": "1394047810", "user": "wmtan"}

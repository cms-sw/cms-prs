This causes problems with the `find()` function of the `edm::DataFrameContainer`, which only works for sorted detector IDs.\r\nSorting the collections produced by `EcalCPUDigisProducer` fixes this.\r\n\r\nThis also adds some code simplifications to `HLTEcalPhiSymFilter`, which is the module for which the issue manifested itself first.\r\n\r\nAddresses https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSHLT-2335\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe digis collection stored by `hltEcalPhiSymFilter` matches between CPU and GPU machines after sorting the collections.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nBackport of #38321 needed for ECAL calibrations", "branch": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 12, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1654872989", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["hlt-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "backport", "ecal"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 38322, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "ECAL - Sort digis collections coming from GPU unpacking - 123x", "updated_at": "1655112244", "user": "thomreis"}

The last used working version was [CMSSW_10_6_28](https://github.com/KIT-CMS/cmssw/tree/embedding_UL_10_6_28).\r\nThe changes also serve as preparation for the production of RUN 3 tau embedding samples.\r\n\r\nThe tau embedding method is used to estimate the genuine di-tau background from data. It is a common method used in analyses with tau leptons. More information about tau embedding can be found in the paper: https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-0221/14/06/P06032\r\nIn principle, one can split the method into 4 steps, but technically there are at least 6 steps that have to be executed.\r\n\r\nIn the past, the production of tau embedding samples was always done with a private fork and with institute computation resources. As a long term solution the production will be integrated in central CMS production.\r\n\r\nThe changes were already presented at tau CQM meetings:\r\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/1366561/#34-integration-of-tau-embeddin\r\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/1301309/#26-tau-embedding-integration-i\r\nAnd will be presented at a RECO meeting:\r\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/1377565/#15-integration-of-state-of-the\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n4 unit tests were added which make sure all steps run through for the 4 different data taking periods in RUN 2 UL. At the moment the event files used for this are stored in a private eos directory.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 40, "comments": 18, "commits": 57, "created_at": "1707145515", "deletions": 860, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 43871, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 13, "state": "open", "title": "Tau Embedding update and integration", "updated_at": "1711216172", "user": "winterchristian"}

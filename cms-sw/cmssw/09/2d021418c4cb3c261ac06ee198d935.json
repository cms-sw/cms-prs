The request was signed-off by PPD, PC, and O&C.\r\nThe plan is to include the change in the master branch to have those collections available from 133X so that it will be part of the campaigns for the TSG 2024 preparation and next year PPD operation.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nThe effect of the change on the event size was tested with a 2023 MinBias, a 2023 ttbar sample, and a 2022 ttHbb sample using a recent 13_3_X release (@kelmorab).\r\nThe summary finding is that the average event size (measured with the disksize.pl script from [SWGuidePATEventSize](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/SWGuidePATEventSize )) depends on the process:\r\n- **MinBias**: 5.6 kb of Scouting Content \r\n- **ttbar**: 11.7 kb of Scouting Content\r\n- **ttHbb**: 8.5 kb of Scouting Content \r\n\r\nThe PR has been prepared starting from CMSSW_13_3_X_2023-09-25-1100:\r\n```\r\ncmsrel CMSSW_13_3_X_2023-09-25-1100\r\ncd CMSSW_13_3_X_2023-09-25-1100/src\r\ncmsenv\r\ngit cms-init\r\ngit cms-addpkg Configuration/EventContent\r\nscram b && scram b code-checks && scram b code-format && scram b\r\n```\r\n\r\n[cc: @missirol @goys @simonepigazzini @jordan-martins]", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1695684568", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["operations-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_3_X", "number": 42863, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Adding the scouting event content to MINIAODSIM", "updated_at": "1695707882", "user": "elfontan"}

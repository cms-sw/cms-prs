The GT differences are as follows:\r\n\r\n**2016 pre-VFP MC**\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/110X_mcRun2_asymptotic_preVFP_v4/110X_mcRun2_asymptotic_preVFP_v5\r\n\r\n**2016 post-VFP MC**\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/110X_mcRun2_asymptotic_v7/110X_mcRun2_asymptotic_v8\r\n\r\n**2016 deco-mode cosmic MC**\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/110X_mcRun2cosmics_startup_deco_v6/110X_mcRun2cosmics_startup_deco_v7\r\n\r\nFor the first two tags, the GT differences with respect to the 10_6_X ultra-legacy GTs already in use are as follows:\r\n\r\n**2016 pre-VFP MC**\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/106X_mcRun2_asymptotic_preVFP_v8/110X_mcRun2_asymptotic_preVFP_v5\r\n\r\n**2016 post-VFP MC**\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/106X_mcRun2_asymptotic_v13/110X_mcRun2_asymptotic_v8\r\n\r\nNone of these differences are relevant: they include moving the AlCaReco trigger bits to the GT, adding the tau payloads to the GT and removing three obsolete pixel records.\r\n\r\nAttn: @jiafulow @hjkwon260 @davignon @dinyar \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThese tags are already in use in the run 2 UL production. More details can be found in the documentation for issue #29237.\r\n\r\nIn addition, a technical test was performed:\r\n\r\n`runTheMatrix.py -l limited,1325.516 --ibeos`\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nThis PR is not a backport but will be backported verbatim to 11_1_X and 11_0_X, which is the reason for retaining the GT prefix \"110X\". In addition, a 10_6_X backport that includes all other remaining UL updates will be generated.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1591765253", "comments": 34, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1591625445", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "4993ab6479480b784b532293c617c18c05793d86", "merged_at": "1591765253", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 30151, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Updated L1T tags to address CMSSW issue #29237", "updated_at": "1591765254", "user": "christopheralanwest"}

Stores the four components: charged hadron, neutral hadron, photon, and pileup.\r\n\r\n- Add a collection of new class pat::IsolatedTrack (inherits from reco::LeafCandidate). Picks out packed PF candidates that satisfy: charged, pT>5,  (fromPV>1 || abs(dz)<0.1), (trackIso<5 GeV || relTrackIso<0.2 || relMiniTrackIso<0.2). Stores p4, pdgId, charge, dz, dxy, and the four components of both regular (dR=0.3) and mini isolation. Also a reference to the original packed candidate.\r\n\r\n- Tested on a sample of DY MC and validated the isolation values. In total, the additions add just over 100 bytes/event on average.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 18, "closed_at": "1495525486", "comments": 56, "commits": 16, "created_at": "1493749034", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "c1ebfd3f7e3f4ead96f6516b8e8f7f6b72c3c7fd", "merged_at": "1495525486", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_2_X", "number": 18548, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 41, "state": "closed", "title": "Add mini-isolation for leptons and a new collection of Isolated Tracks in MiniAOD", "updated_at": "1495525486", "user": "bjmarsh"}

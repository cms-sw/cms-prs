The changes involve moving functionality back to the `interface` and `src` directories. Utility methods defined in `LowPtGsfElectronFeatures.h` guarantee the correct extraction of features (from both AOD and MINIAOD data tiers) for both evaluation (in CMSSW and outside) and training purposes (using workflows defined outside the cms-sw repo).\r\n\r\n3) These changes require the following external: cms-data/RecoEgamma-ElectronIdentification#14, which contains a \"placeholder\" model for the time being. The model weights will be updated again in a future PR once MC samples are available (in progress) for a final retraining. \r\n\r\nValidation has been performed with the \"placeholder\" model and the performance is consistent with our expectations. \r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": "1597794476", "comments": 48, "commits": 10, "created_at": "1596733645", "deletions": 259, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "requires-external", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "6d1ee3282674a444ad729199d1a821a4a0bada03", "merged_at": "1597794475", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 31080, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 20, "state": "closed", "title": "LowPtElectrons: updated BDT model and code base for ID", "updated_at": "1597794476", "user": "bainbrid"}

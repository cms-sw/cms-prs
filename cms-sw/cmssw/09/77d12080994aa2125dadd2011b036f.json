When support for concurrent runs is added to the Framework in the near future, it will become possible for streamBeginRun and streamEndRun to run concurrently with other transitions. There is special code in this module which would be broken by this additional concurrency.\r\n\r\nThis should not affect the output of this module or its externally visible behavior. Results should be the same before and after this is merged.\r\n\r\n@Dr15Jones and @makortel Could you take a look at this also? This is more a technical change related to Framework support of concurrency than a generator issue.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nGiven that this does not change the output or behavior of this module, I am relying on existing tests. The unit tests pass. I also ran existing tests under the debugger and with print statements manually added to verify things were working as expected.\r\n\r\nIf there are any additional tests that generator experts have available, it would be great if someone could run them to verify that I didn't inadvertently break something.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 18, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1663013608", "deletions": 43, "labels": ["generators-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_6_X", "number": 39374, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 18, "state": "open", "title": "Upgrade ConcurrentHadronizerFilter and ConcurrentGeneratorFilter to support concurrent runs", "updated_at": "1663334483", "user": "wddgit"}

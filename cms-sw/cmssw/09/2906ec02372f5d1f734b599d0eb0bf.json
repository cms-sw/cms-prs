GEMs will be enabled starting Run3 (GE1/1), with (possibly) an extension in Phase2 (GE2/1). ME0 will only be enabled starting Phase2. Including GEMs in the Run2_2017 era may be done in the future if the GE1/1 slice test goes well. \n- This PR is purely technical\n- It introduces \"Run3\" and \"Run3_GEM\" in which GE1/1 customizations are applied\n- Phase2 and Phase2_dev include \"Run3_GEM\" and ME0 customizations\n- The baseline or other eras should not be affected. \n\nHGCal and DT fail at the DIGI and L1 step respectively in the simulation unfortunately. However, the simple cmsDriver command below does produce a syntactically correct configuration (see https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/13880#issuecomment-204279041)\n\n<PRE>\ncmsDriver.py SingleMuPt100_cfi  \\\n--conditions auto:upgradePLS3 \\\n-n 10 \\\n--eventcontent FEVTDEBUGHLT \\\n-s GEN,SIM,DIGI:pdigi_valid,L1,DIGI2RAW,RAW2DIGI,L1Reco,RECO,VALIDATION \\\n--datatier GEN-SIM-RECO-RAW-VALIDATION \\\n--geometry Extended2023Muon,Extended2023MuonReco \\\n--era Phase2 \\\n--magField 38T_PostLS1 \\\n--no_exec \\\n--fileout file:out_all.root\n</PRE>\n\n\n@calabria, @jshlee\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 14, "closed_at": "1462013630", "comments": 119, "commits": 15, "created_at": "1459947552", "deletions": 89, "labels": ["comparison-available", "core-approved", "dqm-pending", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-pending", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "32d75103480438180a64f60a037a881a403d336f", "merged_at": "1462013630", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 13963, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 26, "state": "closed", "title": "Split up GEM and ME0 customizations", "updated_at": "1462020924", "user": "dildick"}

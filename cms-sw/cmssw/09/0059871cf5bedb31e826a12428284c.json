This PR proposes a small fix to have them labelled as \"2022\" wfs.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nMaybe useful to backport this down to `12_4_X` that is the data taking release for 2022 (@cms-sw/orp-l2 ?).

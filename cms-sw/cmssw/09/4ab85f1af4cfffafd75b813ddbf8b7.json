This PR contains only the proposed changes to the template CPE algorithm that are simpler, and beneficial for long clusters in heavily irradiated pixel sensors (right-most columns in [slides 23 onwards](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1554785/contributions/6550922/attachments/3081344/5455226/20250605_TOO-PixelCalibAndLocalReco.pdf)). The proposed changes to the algorithm are gated behind a process modifier.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nThe following two plots are showing the RecHit-SimHit distribution in extended-end-of-run-3 muon gun simulation. As expected, the effect is more pronounced in the high eta region.\r\n\r\n![recHitYResLayer1_tracking_central_Template](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb0b6368-7d64-41c4-a382-522404a3d1ff)\r\n![recHitYResLayer1_tracking_forward_Template](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/91eaa333-e4d1-4227-86cd-283276875186)\r\n\r\nAlthough the logic of the code does not change when the `goodEdgeAlgo` flag is set to false, minute differences w.r.t reference were observed in many workflows. We hypothesize it originates from the changed footprint of the `SiPixelTemplate` class. This [draft PR](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/48146/files) contains minimum edit that produces similar differences.\r\n\r\nPR passes the basic battery of tests\r\n```\r\n50 49 48 42 21 1 1 1 1 1 1 tests passed, 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 failed\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Backport\r\nTo be backported to 15.0.X. \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 13, "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1750229998", "deletions": 21, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "db-pending", "operations-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-pending", "trk"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 48356, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Adapt template pixel cpe algo to better handle shortened or broken clusters", "updated_at": "1750230026", "user": "mroguljic"}

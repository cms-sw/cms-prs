This allows `gcc -msse3` to convert loops with floating point operations into `simd` instructions. \r\n\r\nUnder EL8 use system provided mvec which implements vectorized trig functions.  Under sl7, Intel's svml library must be linked to get the same performance. \r\n\r\n\r\nBelow is quoted the data from running the stand alone mkFit executable. This shows the improvements from this PR and the improvements from using AVX and AVX2 instructions sets as well as the improvements from using libmvec on el8.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 45, "commits": 17, "created_at": "1652105289", "deletions": 195, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "tracking"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 37868, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 10, "state": "open", "title": "RecoTracker/MkFitCore: factorize loops to allow gcc -msse3 to vectorize loops", "updated_at": "1652364631", "user": "gartung"}

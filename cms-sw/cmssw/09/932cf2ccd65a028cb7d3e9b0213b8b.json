At 200 pileup it saved ~70Mb memory, there are plots on #9203.  Presumably at lower pileup the savings aren't as good.\n\nNote that this is from empirically checking where the memory was being used - there could be other subclasses of `VirtualJetProducer` that would benefit from a similar fix.  I didn't want to touch the `fjClusterSeq_` object in the base class because I didn't know how the other subclasses use it - for FastjetJetProducer I can see that it's recreated anew with every event.\n\nAt 200 pileup 1/7th of the memory saving was from swapping out the work vectors, and 6/7th was from freeing the `fjClusterSeq_` object.\n\n@rappoccio, @lgray\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1432446395", "comments": 19, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1432212686", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "a0626b74d3f1802164c2d299e0875fbaed5edee8", "merged_at": "1432446395", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 9206, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Trim FastjetJetProducer memory (forward port #9203)", "updated_at": "1433931215", "user": "mark-grimes"}

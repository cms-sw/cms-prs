In order to remove this last vestige of boost::shared_ptr,\nusers of EventSetup need to be converted to std::shared_ptr. This PR does this for Reco packages.\nAlso, std::make_shared is implemented where it makes sense, because it simplifies the code and saves a memory allocation.\nPackages TrackingTools/Gsf\\* are not done in this PR because there is another PR from Vincenzo Innocente making some of the same changes, and I wish to avoid a confluct with that PR.\nThis PR is totally technical.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 92, "closed_at": "1459799696", "comments": 12, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1459604052", "deletions": 295, "labels": ["alca-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "6eb160c627fe56da965f7136b9defd7c4588502d", "merged_at": "1459799696", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 13898, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "use std::shared_ptr and std::make_shared (EventSetup in Reco)", "updated_at": "1464230128", "user": "wmtan"}

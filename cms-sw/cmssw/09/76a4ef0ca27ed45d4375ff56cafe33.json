These variables are useful for displaced e/gamma HLT path. In phase2, we would like to add some displaced e/gamma paths where we would like to cut on these variables. This PR is to enable such studies easily for Phase2 HLT. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n`runTheMatrix.py -l 24834.0` worked fine.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, checked that we are getting reasonable values for sMajor, sMinor. This check was done from Phase2 EGamma HLT setup, using this root file:  \r\n```\r\n/store/mc/Phase2Spring23DIGIRECOMiniAOD/DYToLL_M-10To50_TuneCP5_14TeV-pythia8/GEN-SIM-DIGI-RAW-MINIAOD/noPU_131X_mcRun4_realistic_v5-v1/30000/66eea162-e0cd-4752-a295-5bbca4bd8363.root (1000 events)\r\n```\r\nThese are the histograms for sMajor and sMinor, for barrel, at HLT\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/assets/5052706/90475bb6-80e7-4cfb-9b7c-406ff8e2c1bc\" width=\"350\"> <img src=\"https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/assets/5052706/7da10d61-dad6-44b2-a786-797fc40b5162\" width=\"350\">\r\n\r\nPS: Took this opportunity to do some cleanup.

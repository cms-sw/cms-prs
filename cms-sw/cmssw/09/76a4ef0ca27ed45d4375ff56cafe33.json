These variables are useful for displaced e/gamma HLT path. In phase2, we would like to add some displaced e/gamma paths where we would like to cut on these variables. This PR is to enable such studies easily for Phase2 HLT. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n`runTheMatrix.py -l 24834.0` worked fine.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, checked that we are getting reasonable values for sMajor, sMinor.

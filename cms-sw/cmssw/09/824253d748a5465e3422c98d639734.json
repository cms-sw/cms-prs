The gun generates a Higgs boson at the center of the detector and decays it to two long-lived particles. The long-lived particles are then propagated to their decay vertex and decay to two muons each. The pairs of muons resulting from these decays are then injected into the event as two separate vertices.\r\n\r\nA few groups within the L1Trigger have shown interest in this generator for their own machine learning projects, and I've used it to train machine learning algorithms for a displaced dimuon search at CMS (work in progress).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI've checked the muon distributions generated by this gun, and they match my Python simulation fairly well.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "comments": 3, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1769111927", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["generators-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_1_X", "number": 49901, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Implemented HTo2XTo4LGunProducer", "updated_at": "1769143515", "user": "omiguelc"}

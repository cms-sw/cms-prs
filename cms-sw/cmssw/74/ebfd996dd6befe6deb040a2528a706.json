The production vertex of the extra muon is located at (-x, -y, -z) of the primary muon. \r\n* Along z-axis muon, muon vertex z is generated according to a gaussian. \r\n* Muon momentum along xy and z is generated such that muons are not flying back to the beamspot (pxy * Lxy > 0 and pz * Lz > 0) \r\n* Muons that are produced at too large vz but small Lxy are vetoed. Such muons are not likely to be triggered.\r\n\r\n@dildick, @tahuang1991 @kpedro88 ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1491211871", "comments": 29, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1488632884", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "generators-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "eeb320bc78d642c97f7c69f4c6fca90633952893", "merged_at": "1491211871", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_1_X", "number": 17775, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 6, "state": "closed", "title": "Add new displaced muon gun", "updated_at": "1491211871", "user": "dildick"}

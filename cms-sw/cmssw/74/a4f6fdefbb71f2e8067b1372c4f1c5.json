It temporarily removes L1 monitoring until the new database tables are in place and reports the rates of all L1 tech and algo bits to be 0 (as requested by the DAQ group so as not to have to modify their scripts). The L1 physics/calibration/random value is taken from the event just as before. The prescale index and HLT paths and datasets should all be correct.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_0_patchX", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1457288354", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1457039186", "deletions": 48, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "hlt-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-rejected"], "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_0_patchX", "number": 13586, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Adapting JSON monitoring to L1 Stage 2", "updated_at": "1457288372", "user": "avetisya"}

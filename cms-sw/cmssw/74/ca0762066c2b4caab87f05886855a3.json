One such use case in our data formats is `edm::RefToBase<T>` that internally uses dynamic-polymorphism based type erasure. The straightforward migration path is towards [`edm::Ptr<T>`](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/SWGuideEDMRef).\r\n\r\nPrevious PR #43055 covered the first case on the list.\r\n\r\nAnd this PR covers the second case : \r\nIt contains the set of `edm::RefToBase<T>` that the referenced-to class appear to be unused.\r\nThe unused code, the dictionaries and/or type aliases are removed.\r\n\r\nAs described in #42737, \r\n- Clean up the unused `reco::WMuNuCandidatePtr` and `reco::WMuNuCandidate`.\r\n\r\n- Replace `edm::RefToBase<CaloRecHit>` with `edm::Ptr<CaloRecHit>` (if no need to be kept, then I will remove).  \r\n`edm::RefToBase<CaloRecHit>CaloRecHitRef` used as a member data of `CaloRecHitCandidate`. And `CaloRecHitCandidate` seems to be only produced by `CaloRecHitCandidateProducer<T>`. Unclear if anything consumes. The template instantiations seem to be unused.  \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nTested in CMSSW_13_3_0_pre3, the basic test passed in the [CMSSW PR instructions](https://cms-sw.github.io/PRWorkflow.html)", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 10, "comments": 21, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1698024846", "deletions": 262, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "analysis-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_3_X", "number": 43080, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 7, "state": "open", "title": "Clean up and migrating edm::RefToBase to edm::Ptr (list 2 for RNTuple)", "updated_at": "1698376483", "user": "jeongeun"}

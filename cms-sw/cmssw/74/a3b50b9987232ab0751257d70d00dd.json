Some ad hoc z shifts are removed, and the x-y order of the module layout is reviewed for a consistent treatment fo both disc faces. x-y sensor positions are unchanged overall, but the assignment of ETLDetId changes.\r\n\r\nThe scenario D75 is now used as the baseline for unit tests in both the Geometry and the RecOMTD/DetLayers packages. A corresponding update of the references used by Geometry unit tests is proposed in https://github.com/cms-data/Geometry-TestReference/pull/5 , they need to be integrated at the same time in order to avoid failures.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nUnit tests run, and a visual inspection shows the expected results. The upgrade test workflow 34234.0 for scenario D75 runs smoothly. The Geant4 overlap test does not show any residual issue in ```EndcapTimingLayer```.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 12, "closed_at": "1613028358", "comments": 30, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1612778242", "deletions": 3241, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "requires-external", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "9f615dd2000243fc2a35c7ec7327734f0c7aa59e", "merged_at": "1613028358", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 32840, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "MTD geometry: update etlv5 setup to fit in D75-D76 envelope without overlaps, move unit tests to D76", "updated_at": "1613028358", "user": "fabiocos"}

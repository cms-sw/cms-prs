This is because its very very slow to change a histogram labels which this does when it thinks it has created a new histogram. \r\n\r\nIt superseeds: https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/36313\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nThe histograms are identical before and after this PR with the exception that the number of entries now accurately reflects the number of times SetBinContent should be called  (before it was that number times the number of LS +1)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nWe'll need this in 12_3_0, its causing a real problem when running on reemulated L1 samples (which have lots of LS to gain stats).

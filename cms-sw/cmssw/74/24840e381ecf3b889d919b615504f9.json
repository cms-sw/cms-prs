Among other things, this allows to fully follow the history of each track.\n- The \"high purity\" selectors for HI muon RegIt steps now set the highPurity flag to the tracks they find. Since this was not the case before (only \"loose\" or \"tight\" qualities were set), tracks found both by standard HI tracking and by HI muon RegIt \"lost\" their highPurity flag, thus effectively slightly biasing down the tracking efficiency close to muons.\n- The \"tight\" and \"high purity\" selectors for HI muon RegIt steps now inherit from the HI default selectors, not the pp ones, so that the selection of these qualities is more consistent. The \"loose\" selectors still inherit from pp, so as to be more permissive.\n\nThis PR is not expected to significantly change the reconstruction, except a tiny (sub-percent) increase of charged PF multiplicity in some events with high muon multiplicity.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 12, "closed_at": "1440911777", "comments": 55, "commits": 12, "created_at": "1439212548", "deletions": 56, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "fb72a105cbc1c05df9b87296a11f3643fc08fa95", "merged_at": "1440911777", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 10653, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "New track algorithm names for HI muon RegIt", "updated_at": "1440911777", "user": "echapon"}

In particular, two unit tests will now go into infinite loops.\nThis temporary workaround inserts asserts to cause these two tests to fail immediately, to avoid infinite loops, which are not good for system resources.\nPlease merge this request as soon as you can.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_3_ROOT6_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1416866773", "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1416865866", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["alca-pending", "comparison-pending", "db-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "3efe68bf227a8d7d0f280bfbb833e3985594e772", "merged_at": "1416866773", "merged_by": "davidlt", "number": 6579, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fail deliberately to avoid infinite loop", "updated_at": "1416920097", "user": "wmtan"}

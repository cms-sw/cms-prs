That pull request fixed a ROOT6 error.\nSince this was just one instance of a template, there is no declared ROOT version number associated with the instance.  Rather, there is a version number for the entire template.  That version number should have been incremented in #2434, because making a member transient affects the checksum, but was not.  This pull request increments the ROOT version of the template. This fixes the fatal exception seen by Vincenzo Innocente when reading a file containing the older version of the class.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1392844281", "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1392843111", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["core-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "ec6f62d42b529cc35c9b79a3e7805d4315d4c1ce", "merged_at": "1392844281", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_1_0_pre5", "number": 2544, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Increment version number of AssociationVector template", "updated_at": "1394439757", "user": "wmtan"}

Looking at the algorithm, the code expects the subroutine values to be preserved between calls. The portable way of doing that is to use the `save` keyword.\r\n\r\nOne of the previous uninitialized fixes incorrectly reset the value of an array each call rather than using `save` which is needed for the algorithm to properly work.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe code compiles. As the warning was in the aarch64 build and I do not have access to that machine, it is unclear if the warning will go away.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 7, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1678116813", "deletions": 7, "labels": ["generators-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_1_X", "number": 40962, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Make sure variables are preserved in ReggeGribovPartonMCInterface", "updated_at": "1678126272", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

The study leading to this adjustment is described\r\nin the following talks:\r\n\r\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/649519/contributions/2641896/attachments/1495616/2326893/20170719_Jae_HCALPSG_TDC6263.pdf\r\n\r\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/652743/contributions/2656951/attachments/1506347/2347457/20170809_Jae_HCALPSG_TDC6263.pdf\r\n\r\nHere is a brief summary of issues:\r\n\r\n-- The energy collected by the anode with \"undershoot\" is only weakly\r\ncorrelated with the energy collected by its neighbor anode. Therefore,\r\ndiscarding the anode with \"undershoot\" (and multiplying the energy of\r\nthe neighbor by 2) would normally lead to incorrect energy determination.\r\n\r\n-- It is believed that the \"overshoot\" condition is most likely caused\r\nby pile-up rather than by particle hitting the PMT window and\r\nmigrating the pulse to the previous time slice. The anodes with\r\n\"overshoot\" do exhibit substantial correlation with their neighbors,\r\nso it is judged that the effect of pile-up is small and can be\r\nneglected.\r\n\r\nThis PR will not modify any relval results for MC. Minor changes are\r\nexpected for data.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1503431975", "comments": 33, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1502767555", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["code-checks-rejected", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "04416c4aa77487eac4340507518948dac3ae1b53", "merged_at": "1503431975", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_3_X", "number": 20170, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Allowing HF anodes with special TDC values to participate in energy reco", "updated_at": "1503431975", "user": "igv4321"}

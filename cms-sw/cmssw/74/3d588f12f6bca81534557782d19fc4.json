Locking and synchronization\ncode was only added where necessary. Parts of it will\nalready be synchronized by the new Framework (it took\nsome careful manual review to determine that). A mutex\nis used to lock where writes to the output file could\noccur concurrently. Some internal data structures were\nsplit into separate structures for the primary source,\nsecondary file source, and the secondary (mixing) source\nto prevent data races. Some other functions were modified\nto minimize the parts of the data structures that are\naccessed.Some unused code was deleted. Some obscure bugs\nrelated to the secondary source were fixed. Unit tests\nupdated.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 36, "closed_at": "1380263050", "comments": 8, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1379960295", "deletions": 761, "labels": ["core-approved", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "af87f2c5cd4393a05c0f6354014f1f2d6d48ffd6", "merged_at": "1380263050", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_0_0_pre5", "number": 905, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 6, "state": "closed", "title": "Multithreaded JobReport", "updated_at": "1383934636", "user": "wddgit"}

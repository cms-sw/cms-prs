This version contains important bug fixes, and is compatible with ipython 3.1. I am going to request ipython 3.1 for 74X in cmsdist now and link the two pull requests together. \n\nIt would be great if these two requests could enter CMSSW at the same time. \n\n@arizzi @gpetruc : we do a PR later with new changes from you guys anytime you want after the migration to ipython 3.1. Here, I'm only fixing critical problems. \n\n@degano : same stuff as what we discussed for 75X.\n\nColin\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 43, "closed_at": "1434693338", "comments": 9, "commits": 51, "created_at": "1433937160", "deletions": 416, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-pending", "hold", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "ced26ac14fa44727383fd51df9b4deb2d65e78c6", "merged_at": "1434693338", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 9544, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Heppy 7 4 4 patch4", "updated_at": "1443702340", "user": "cbernet"}

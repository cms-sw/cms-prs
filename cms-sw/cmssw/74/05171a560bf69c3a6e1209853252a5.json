The fileNames() function returns  std::vector<std::string> which the code sets iterators to which then instantly become invalid as they are dangling. \r\n\r\nThis keeps an internal copy of the returned std::vector<string> and sets the iterators to that. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nIt now successfully processes events in multiple files rather than spewing random garbage to the terminal. \r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nWill be backported to 12_3_X as useful for hilton setup there. \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1650968706", "comments": 8, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1650950207", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["daq-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "bug-fix", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "c885a365def83f2dff00efeb74edf841bfa70abe", "merged_at": "1650968706", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 37677, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "FRDStreamSource Dangling Reference Fix : 12_4_X", "updated_at": "1650968707", "user": "Sam-Harper"}

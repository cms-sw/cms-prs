Not that this is *not* required for this PR.\r\n- A conversion to `edm::one::EDProducer<Accumulator>` should be a trivial change on top of #22243 and this one.\r\n- The functional changes are 5d9538e, which performs the migration and removes now-obsolete logic, and bc0cd87, which fixes behaviour of per-lumi histograms and reintroduces some of the old logic for new purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1519142038", "comments": 79, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1518713584", "deletions": 405, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_1_X", "number": 22244, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 5, "state": "closed", "title": "Migrate DQM to `edm::one::EDAnalyzer`", "updated_at": "1519144362", "user": "schneiml"}

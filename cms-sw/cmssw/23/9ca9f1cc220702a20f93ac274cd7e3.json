Not that this is *not* required for this PR.\r\n- It comes with some downsides from a framework point of view: This solution will *not* work with multiple, concurrent LS (and the lumi-watching `edm::one::EDAnalyzer` will block the framework from using them -- if I understand correctly, @Dr15Jones?). However, this is not an issue for now, since these are not used *anyways* in production. So this is a fine temporary solution, even for data taking.\r\n- There is still an issue with per-lumi histograms that needs to be fixed.\r\n- A conversion to `edm::one::EDProducer<Accumulator>` should be a trivial change on top of #22243 and this one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 8, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1518713584", "deletions": 422, "labels": ["code-checks-rejected", "comparison-pending", "dqm-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_1_X", "number": 22244, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Migrate DQM to `edm::one::EDAnalyzer`", "updated_at": "1518714232", "user": "schneiml"}

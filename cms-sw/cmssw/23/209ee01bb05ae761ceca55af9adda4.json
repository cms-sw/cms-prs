This would add 13 taggers and 4 mass regression correctors to Scouting NanoAOD.\r\n\r\nScouting Global Particle Transformer (Glo-ParT) is an inclusive tagging model for AK8 scouting PFjets. It functions as both a global tagger and a mass regression model for AK8 scouting PFjets and can also be utilized as a pre-trained model. Further details can be found in the slides.\r\n\r\nPlease test this PR with https://github.com/cms-data/RecoBTag-Combined/pull/67.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe PR passed the tests listed at https://cms-sw.github.io/PRWorkflow.html.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

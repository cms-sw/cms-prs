This code is not returned when exiting like in other programs, but instead written to a one-character text file. We pick up this file and read back the code. \r\nWarning or error messages are emitted if anomalous codes are encountered, depending on the severity.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n- unit tests of `MillePedeAlignmentAlgorithm` and `CommonAlignmentAlgorithm`: :heavy_check_mark: \r\n- limited `runTheMatrix` payload: :heavy_check_mark: (exception: The usual missing inputs)\r\n- runTheMatrix with alignment-related payloads `1000,1001,1001.2,1001.3,1001.4,1002.3,1002.4,1002.5` - four step-2 failures due to missing input, otherwise :heavy_check_mark: \r\n- test using modified code to re-run `mp4141` alignment campaign's `pede` job - successful execution\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

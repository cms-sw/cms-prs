It was returning 8001 instead of 8021. See Issue #42179 for more discussion.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRelies on existing tests. In addition, there is a new unit test in 14_0_X.\r\n\r\n#### \r\n\r\nThis is a backport to 12_4_X of PR #43579. The backport is needed because the bug makes it more difficult for operators to diagnose operational failures.\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1703017275", "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1703003089", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "c0e80d6f9291caad8f10e6fe1600c957f5d69df4", "merged_at": "1703017275", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 43608, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix bug related to cmsRun exit code with FileReadError, 12_4_X backport", "updated_at": "1703017276", "user": "wddgit"}

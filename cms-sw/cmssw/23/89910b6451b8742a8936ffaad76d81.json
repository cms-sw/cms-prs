It is expected in that geometry, a slightly increase of digis due to the recovery of the migrated charges. \r\n\r\nwatchers: @claralasa, @emiglior , @skinnari \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n * Passed the `runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos` tests, not sure if they are relevant because I'm not sure if they were tested against 2026D65 geometry. \r\n * Checked successfully with the 30210.0\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\nIt is not (although we will like to backport to 11.2.X ... I suppose that I should open a new PR when this is merged?)\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1611320704", "comments": 13, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1611159593", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "87d02c2f16bfbf840053ee48ed467ee33723ce13", "merged_at": "1611320704", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 32698, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "[Phase2 3D Digitizer] Fix several bugs related with charge migration", "updated_at": "1611320704", "user": "duartej"}

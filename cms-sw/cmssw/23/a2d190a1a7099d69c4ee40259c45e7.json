If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nThis is a backport to 13_1_X, which is next in production. \r\nMaster PR is : https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/41830\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_13_1_X", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 1, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1685540371", "deletions": 9, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_1_X", "number": 41831, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Fix logical error in the check of mask flag bits [13_1_X]", "updated_at": "1685540486", "user": "abhih1"}

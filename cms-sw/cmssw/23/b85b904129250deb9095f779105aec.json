Unit tests to be restored when new relvals are available.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 85, "closed_at": "1441374505", "comments": 14, "commits": 20, "created_at": "1441178290", "deletions": 2700, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-available", "fastsim-pending", "geometry-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 11078, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "FastSim: new rechits containers", "updated_at": "1441374837", "user": "lveldere"}

Additionally, a new `SimPPS/DirectSimProducer/test/test_NanoAOD_cfg.py` test configuration is provided for a LPAIR NanoAOD sample generated centrally, allowing to produce NanoAOD-level collections from generator level information.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

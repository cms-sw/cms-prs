So even if there was no GsfTrack, good \"auto\" pass values were written. This unfortunately causes the mu-electron DZ filters to crash they dont check they actually find an electron.\r\n\r\nThis fix makes the default values only be written if the electron actually has a track. So no trackless electrons can now pass through to the DZ filters. \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nSam", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1523974624", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "hlt-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-started"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 22987, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Fixing Default Values of EgammaHLTGsfTrackVarProducer to be only used if there is a track found : 102X", "updated_at": "1523975145", "user": "Sam-Harper"}

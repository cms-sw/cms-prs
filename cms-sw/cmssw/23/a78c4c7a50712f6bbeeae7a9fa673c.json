So even if there was no GsfTrack, good \"auto\" pass values were written. This unfortunately causes the mu-electron DZ filters to crash they dont check they actually find an electron.\r\n\r\nThis fix makes the default values only be written if the electron actually has a track. So no trackless electrons can now pass through to the DZ filters. \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nSam", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1524053118", "comments": 12, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1523974624", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["bug-fix", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "hlt-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "2e29ae56ff4b2989cb738f35e17a10259b920d52", "merged_at": "1524053118", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 22987, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fixing Default Values of EgammaHLTGsfTrackVarProducer to be only used if there is a track found : 102X", "updated_at": "1524053118", "user": "Sam-Harper"}

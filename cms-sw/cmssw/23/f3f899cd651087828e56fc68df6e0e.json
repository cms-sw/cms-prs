This contains the list of the Stack Modules (trackerStructureTopology.xml).\nThe new TkDDDStructure is recognized into the trk geom introducing a new GDEnumType called OTPhase2Stack (CmsTrackerStringToEnum.cc).\nThe CmsDetConstruction class has been modified in such a way that it can recognize when the module is a stack and configured to search for possible children: for Lower and Upper modules in a stack are fixed, following the same convention used for glued modules (+1, +2).\nFinally, the README has been updated in order to include the description of the Stacks DetIds.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_6_2_SLHCDEV_X", "changed_files": 8, "closed_at": "1446719104", "comments": 12, "commits": 8, "created_at": "1445850375", "deletions": 41, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "geometry-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "30e47f50cb8f7a3c42abed781bdbbc3203632e1c", "merged_at": "1446719104", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_6_2_SLHCDEV_X", "number": 12093, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Introducing Stacks in CMSSW geometry", "updated_at": "1446719104", "user": "ebrondol"}

This new gun enables generation of displaced unstable particles which is not possible with already existing [FlatRandomPtAndDxyGunProducer](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/IOMC/ParticleGuns/src/FlatRandomPtAndDxyGunProducer.cc).\r\n\r\nTechnically, the PR migrates an algorithm present in the [FlatRandomPtAndDxyGunProducer](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/IOMC/ParticleGuns/src/FlatRandomPtAndDxyGunProducer.cc) to a new module based on a generic Py8 gun ([Py8GunBase](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/GeneratorInterface/Pythia8Interface/interface/Py8GunBase.h)).\r\n\r\nWe consider to backport the PR to 11_2_X for a MC production for Run-3 studies.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nIt was validated with a custom workflow that the newly added module behaves as expected.  \r\nThe change does not affect any existing workflows by construction (a new \"source\" added).\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1622720919", "comments": 22, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1621949040", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "generators-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-started"], "merge_commit_sha": "5785639ab4112137659e309cd30cb655ea6ea3eb", "merged_at": "1622720919", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "number": 33832, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "Add a Pythia8 gun for displaced particles (flat in Pt and Dxy)", "updated_at": "1622720920", "user": "mbluj"}

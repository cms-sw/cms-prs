To comply with this, the alias `(HLT:)@relval2023` is introduced to run the GRun menu in the 2023/24 MC and Run-3 data RelVals, and the alias `(HLT:)@relval2022` is made to point to the frozen 2022 HLT menu. To pick up the appropriate HLT menu in all relevant wfs, changes in `Configuration/PyReleaseValidation` were needed.\r\n\r\n[1]\r\n  - [CMSHLT-2678](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSHLT-2678): [HCAL] removed `L1_SingleMuOpen` seed from `HLT_HcalPhiSym_v` trigger\r\n  - [CMSHLT-2687](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSHLT-2687): [BPH] update of `Tau3Mu` triggers (2023 L1T seeds)\r\n  - [CMSHLT-2688](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSHLT-2688): [BPH] removed `L1_DoubleMu3er2p0_SQ_OS_dR_Max1p4` seed from BPH dimuon triggers\r\n  - [CMSHLT-2689](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSHLT-2689): [JME] use L1T-Jet-FWD2p5 seeds in `PFJetFwd` and `DiPFJetAve` triggers (2023 L1T seeds)\r\n  - [CMSHLT-2690](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSHLT-2690): [BTV] update of `BTagMu*DiJet` triggers (2023 L1T seeds)\r\n  - [CMSHLT-2699](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSHLT-2699): [HIG] added backup L1T VBFDiJetIsoTau seed (2023 L1T seed)\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTSG tests.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

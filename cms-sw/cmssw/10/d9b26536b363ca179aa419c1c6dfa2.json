CMSSW software needs to be modified to handle that. Following\nhttps://hypernews.cern.ch/HyperNews/CMS/get/recoDevelopment/1302.html\nI am making changes to different packages, here Tracking/Vertexing. I am using the events/run/lumi types defined in DataFormats/Provenance/interface/RunLumiEventNumber.h . Updates are generally trivial and there should be no any visible effects of them (except for the rare event numbers with > 32 bits). \n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_3_X", "changed_files": 8, "closed_at": "1415363529", "comments": 7, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1415291559", "deletions": 21, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "e6563d4255be0a755ca4c32039955292d770d27d", "merged_at": "1415363529", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_3_X", "number": 6252, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "Update types of event/run/lumi in Tracking/Vertexing", "updated_at": "1415363529", "user": "StoyanStoynev"}

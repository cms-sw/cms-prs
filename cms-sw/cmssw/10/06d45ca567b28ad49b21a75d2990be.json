This is primarily for fast timing studies.\nNote that the collection does not have any links to the daughter particles in a corresponding TrackingParticle collection.\n\nUsually the information added is a duplicate subset of what's in the other TrackingVertex collection(s), but there is no selection applied on this new collection.  For the other collection(s), one of the daughters/granddaughters of the vertex needs to pass the TrackingParticle selection criteria or the vertex won't be added.\n\nIf switched on the new collection adds approximately 182120 bytes/event uncompressed, 31235 bytes/event compressed.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1430939063", "comments": 6, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1430924982", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "fastsim-approved", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "337d7e67bda64d9c01cccb1c5d296cff003d8af5", "merged_at": "1430939063", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "number": 8975, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add an option to TrackingTruthAccumulator to save a collection of the initial interactions", "updated_at": "1430988654", "user": "mark-grimes"}

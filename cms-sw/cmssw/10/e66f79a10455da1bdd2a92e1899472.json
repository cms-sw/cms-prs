If at transition processing time the data product matched is not found, no further matches are attempted.\r\n\r\nInternally the ProductResolverIndexHelper now holds an entry to lookup which ProductResolver to call if one requests to  _skip current process_ . This is now also determined at begin job time rather than at run time.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles and all framework unit tests (after modification) pass.\r\n\r\nresolves https://github.com/cms-sw/framework-team/issues/1522", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 37, "comments": 11, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1756227148", "deletions": 1039, "labels": ["core-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-rejected", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "changes-dataformats"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 48807, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 6, "state": "open", "title": "Determine non-process name lookups at begin job", "updated_at": "1756239275", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

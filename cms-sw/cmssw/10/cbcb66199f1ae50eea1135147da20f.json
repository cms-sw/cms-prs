In the current situation the onine DQM shows bad ECAL timing distributions due to this.\r\nWith an additional EcalTimeCalibConstants record added to the HLT GT both algorithms can be given the correct calibrations with the parameters added in this PR.\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_13_2_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1695656242", "comments": 17, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1695379634", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["hlt-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "backport-ok", "ecal"], "merge_commit_sha": "0bc99c13325f64d1ade2a3aab7b391e0fdd67e47", "merged_at": "1695656242", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_13_2_X", "number": 42845, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Prepare ECAL multifit reconstruction to use different time calibration records - 132x", "updated_at": "1695656243", "user": "thomreis"}

The issue is that the same value is accessed before threads are synchronised. In the examples tested offline, this tends to return almost-always the correct results on GPU, but incorrect ones on CPU (or rather, \"serial_sync\" backend) as the samples in the latter case are processed one at the time.\r\n\r\nThis change and related validation (see below) were discussed offline last week with @fwyzard and @kakwok.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nWe found one event where the list of HBHE RecHits produced with the \"serial_sync\" backend did not match the one of the \"cuda_async\" backend. A reproducer is in [0]. Adding the printouts in [1], one can see that the value of `shrEnergyM0TotalAccum[lch]` is different on Alpaka-on-CPU [2] compared to Alpaka-on-GPU [3] (see \"MAHI-05\" in the printout). For that event,\r\n - 1 hit (id 1164465195) is present in legacy, CUDA, and Alpaka-on-GPU, but it is missing in Alpaka-on-CPU, and\r\n - 2 other hits (ids 1162890307 and 1164463148) have different energy values in legacy vs Alpaka-on-CPU (in legacy they have energy==0, while in Alpaka-on-CPU they have energy > 0).\r\n\r\nThe fix in this PR leads to agreement for the HBHE-RecHits in the 4 cases (legacy, CUDA, Alpaka-on-CPU, Alpaka-on-GPU). The list of RecHits was also tested explicitly on a few more events, and no differences were found. @fwyzard also compared the trigger results of HLT for O(100k) HLTPhysics including this change, and saw that discrepancies between Alpaka-on-CPU and Alpaka-on-GPU are reduced, as expected (remaining discrepancies are likely the usual ones, and unrelated to HCAL).\r\n\r\nThese checks were done on top of `CMSSW_14_0_11_MULTIARCHS`.\r\n\r\nMore details are also available in [CMSHLT-3283](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSHLT-3283).\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

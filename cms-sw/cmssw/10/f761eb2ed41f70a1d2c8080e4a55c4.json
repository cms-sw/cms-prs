Adds a plot to see the 2D distribution of the mean of presample noise.\r\n2. Increases x range and nbins of the 1D distribution of the noise mean.\r\n3. Adjusts the energy threshold for the timing plot in the forward region of Ecal endcaps.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis was validated by running the online DQM workflow and testing the plots on a test DQM GUI. \r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with any link to the master PR, or the intended backport release cycle numbers -->\r\nBackport to 12_3_X: https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/38704\r\nBackport to 12_4_X: https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/38705\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1657867866", "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1657625457", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "c1e18ac0933809a58747d21dee99ff01e1c559fb", "merged_at": "1657867866", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 38703, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add a noise plot and some minor adjustments to ECAL DQM [Master]", "updated_at": "1657867867", "user": "abhih1"}

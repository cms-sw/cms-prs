It can accept a parameter set vector for threshold cuts, one for each subdetector, but only one set can be saved at a time. This PR extends this class to accommodate parameter sets for multiple detector enums.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI haven't done anything specifically for this branch, but https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/37219 was merged successfully.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nSee discussion on https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/37219\r\nThe backport was sugggested, so that it will be picked up for Run 3 startup HLT.\r\n\r\n@laurenhay @marksan87 @juska @kdlong @silviodonato @missirol ", "branch": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1649855953", "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1649853135", "deletions": 20, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "backport-ok"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 37550, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Backport: Bug fix for multiple detectors in PFRecHitQTestHCALThresholdVsDepth test", "updated_at": "1649855953", "user": "hatakeyamak"}

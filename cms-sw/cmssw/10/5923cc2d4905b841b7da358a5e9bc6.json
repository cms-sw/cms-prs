This problem is occurring presently in older releases if they try to read files which contain the new string encoding for ParameterSets.\r\n- Throw exception if TFile::Open returns nullptr.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis code was tested in CMSSW_10_6_30 and even with the backport seg faulted when reading a file generated in CMSSW_13_3. The problem was traced down to ROOT silently ignoring a failure while unzipping StreamerInfo. Added additional check on nullptr from TFile::Open gives a graceful exit to the job from an exception.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. \r\n\r\nPart of large scale backport of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/43894\r\n\r\nfixes https://github.com/makortel/framework/issues/804", "branch": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1707851707", "comments": 7, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1707332225", "deletions": 11, "labels": ["core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "41aa212101f0855c733f6d73f180a8c58da81503", "merged_at": "1707851707", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 43902, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 5, "state": "closed", "title": "Issue exception for ROOT file forward incompatiblity problem [10_6]", "updated_at": "1707851708", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

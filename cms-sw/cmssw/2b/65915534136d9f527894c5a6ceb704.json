This PR adds the move operators and makes sure each `evt_` is deleted exactly once when moving objects.\r\n\r\nTested in CMSSW_10_2_X_2018-04-12-2300, in principle expecting no changes but cannot fully exclude them.\r\n\r\n@Dr15Jones ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1524478227", "comments": 18, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1524028434", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "generators-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "877c9a2c129ac7d1bbec48ac0ade0cf2dc4b2461", "merged_at": "1524478227", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 22989, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add move constructor and assignment operator to edm::HepMCProduct", "updated_at": "1524478227", "user": "makortel"}

The CCLUT algorithm is currently not turned on in CSC TP emulator, so this will stay disabled on EMTF side as well. Therefore we expect no changes after this PR for now. The functionality will be turned on once everything is ready on CSC and EMTF side.\r\n\r\n- Modified `EMTFHit`, `EMTFTrack`, and `MuonTriggerPrimitive` data formats to add the new parameters.\r\n- Modified EMTF `PrimitiveConversion` to use new variables when they are enabled\r\n- Added a flag in `simEmtfDigis` to enable/disable the functionality. For now keeping the flag as `False` will be turned on depending era in the future.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nValidated with:\r\n\r\n- scram b runtests\r\n- runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos\r\n\r\nNotifications: @jiafulow @dildick ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 11, "closed_at": "1625580389", "comments": 8, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1625490740", "deletions": 21, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "0fe05409271f165d5d7d1b843bfd5dcb85446016", "merged_at": "1625580388", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "number": 34334, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "EMTF Emulator Update to Add Run 3 CSC TP variables", "updated_at": "1625580389", "user": "eyigitba"}

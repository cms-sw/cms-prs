This is mainly a reorganization of loops in the front-end part of the trigger.\n- Optimization of the memory footprint of the HGCAL trigger geometry. It now makes use of the detid structure to associate cells to trigger cells and trigger modules, instead of storing the full trigger cells and modules maps.  This involves changes in the interface of the geometry.\n- Updates in the HGCAL trigger tests\n- Some bugfixes\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 33, "closed_at": "1474522770", "comments": 38, "commits": 47, "created_at": "1473346928", "deletions": 475, "labels": ["comparison-available", "l1-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "4b2f7e3776ff06c5d8ef07aac89263ed55d72f2c", "merged_at": "1474522770", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 15782, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 5, "state": "closed", "title": "Optimizations of the HGCAL L1 trigger", "updated_at": "1474522770", "user": "jbsauvan"}

Helped me getting my code cleaner with more range-based loops! I propose here to do the same refreshing for RecoEgamma.\r\n\r\nWhile looking for calls to `edm::View<T>::ptrAt()`, which indicate there is potential for a range-based loop, I stumbled upon the EGRegressionModifierV1 and EGRegressionModifierV2 which horrified me a little bit: half of the code was just copy-paste remnant boilerplate code that is not used, so I also worked a little on that.\r\n\r\nLocal matrix tests pass.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 18, "comments": 0, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1545322450", "deletions": 1113, "labels": [], "number": 25536, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Use of edm::View<T>::ptrs() in RecoEgamma and work on EGRegressionModifierV2", "updated_at": "1545322450", "user": "guitargeek"}

Helped me getting my code cleaner with more range-based loops! I propose here to do the same refreshing for RecoEgamma to promote this pattern a little bit.\r\n\r\nWhile looking for calls to `edm::View<T>::ptrAt()`, which indicate there is potential for a range-based loop, I stumbled upon the EGRegressionModifierV1 and EGRegressionModifierV2 which horrified me slightly: half of the code was just copy-paste remnant boilerplate code that is not used, so I also worked on that.\r\n\r\nLocal matrix tests pass.

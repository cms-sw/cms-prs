This information will be used in uGMT to build the `TwoLooseDiffSectorInTime` trigger.\r\n\r\nI also cleaned the configurable parameters `nLooseShowers_`, `nNominalShowers_`, and `nTightShowers_`. The number of showers is already indicated in the boolean name and these configurables don't really add any configuration options. i.e the condition for `hasOneNominalInTime` should always be one or more showers.\r\n\r\nThe data format changes were done in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/40890 and uGMT logic update is done in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/41042\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with a description of the feature proposed or problem addressed, specifying:\r\n  - what changes are expected in the output if any, \r\n  - what other PRs or externals it depends upon if any,\r\n  - link to any additional material useful to provide a documentation for this PR (slides, JIRA tickets, related pull requestes, hypernews, TWiki or Indico pages)  -->\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nValidated by producing ntuples which had expected amount of loose showers. \r\n\r\nAlso ran `runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos` with no failures. \r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with a description of which tests have been performed to verify the correctness of the PR, including the eventual addition of new code for testing like unit tests, test configurations, additions or updates to the runTheMatrix test workflows -->\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

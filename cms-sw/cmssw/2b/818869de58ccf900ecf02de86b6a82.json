Add input jet variables needed for the quark vs gluon likelihood (QGL) in the JME Custom-NanoAODs. The variables are useful QGL developers when they need to train the likelihood for future new releases. The input variables are already calculated together with the QGL discriminant in the [main](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/CMSSW_10_2_18/PhysicsTools/NanoAOD/python/jets_cff.py#L569) NanoAOD production. They are not saved in the main NanoAODs by default. Previous (closed) PR for this is #29239.\r\n\r\n2. Remove deprecated \"jerc\" variables and add new ones in line with the latest jets_cff.py. This fix is for issue #29245.\r\n\r\nThis PR needs to be backported to 10_6_X, once merged, for the ultra legacy campaigns.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1585071360", "comments": 14, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1584725716", "deletions": 12, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved", "xpog-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "4d484b25f41d29d3d098e9da203a1dc7a15e7e4c", "merged_at": "1585071360", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 29257, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add QGL input variables and update jerc variables in JME Custom-NanoAODs", "updated_at": "1585071360", "user": "nurfikri89"}

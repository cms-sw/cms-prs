In addition, there is a new unit test in 14_0_X.\r\n\r\n#### This is a backport to 13_3_X of PR #43579. The backport is needed because the bug makes it more difficult for operators to diagnose operational failures.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_13_3_X", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1702932654", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_3_X", "number": 43594, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Fix bug related to cmsRun exit code with FileReadError, 13_3_X back port", "updated_at": "1703000772", "user": "wddgit"}

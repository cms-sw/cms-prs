By default we propose to store it in the precision with 10 bits.\r\n\r\nBackport: https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/44285\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nrunTheMatrix tests have been successfully run for the following workflow :\r\n runTheMatrix.py -l 12434.0\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\n\r\nWe target this to go in the next nano production, V14 .\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_10_4_X", "changed_files": 52367, "closed_at": "1709694711", "comments": 0, "commits": 10000, "created_at": "1709694683", "deletions": 4368862, "labels": [], "number": 44324, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Nanoaod pvsumpxpy 14 0", "updated_at": "1709694711", "user": "JunquanTao"}

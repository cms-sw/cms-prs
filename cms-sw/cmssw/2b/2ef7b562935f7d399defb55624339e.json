These problems all caused failures in conditions code in many relval tests in the ROOT6 branch.\n\n1)MemberWithDict::typeof(), when the member is a C array, stripped off the array information and just returned the underlying type.  The array information should not have been stripped.\n\n2) A framework unit test is added here that would have found the above problem.\n\n3) TypeID::className() put a space between the base type name and the opening square bracket. This is incompatible with the naming used by conditions.\n\n4) In the ROOT6 specific code in CondCore/ORA, the C array information was not stripped off in several places where it should have been.  This pull request strips it off when needed,\n\nNote:  Items 1, 2, and 3 are not ROOT6 specific. The fixes and tests there will be back ported to 7_1_X.\nItem 1 may be backported further if offline management wants it.\n\nPlease merge this in the ROOT6 branch promptly unless there are issues.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_ROOT6_X", "changed_files": 11, "closed_at": "1393534197", "comments": 1, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1393533925", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["core-pending", "db-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "ce21a6c6b7b4bd6f07c77e1d5e5f3bba9a2c35ac", "merged_at": "1393534197", "merged_by": "ktf", "number": 2666, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix introspection of C array data members", "updated_at": "1393535484", "user": "wmtan"}

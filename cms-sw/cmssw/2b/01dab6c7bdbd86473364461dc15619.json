An additional fourth PR with final DQM plot updates is being prepared for submission to master this weekend, that will also be backported to 13_0_X.\r\n\r\nThis backport is for a special TOTEM release to be ready for testing start of next week (https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/41859#issuecomment-1584370879).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nT2 & PPS unit tests were run successfully, as were several PPS workflows and a few relVals that had failed with the geometry error noted above, before descoping of PR #41859 .\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nThis is a backport to 13_0_X for a special TOTEM release, consisting of three recent Totem T2 PRs: #41472 , #41777 & #41859 .\r\n\r\n<!-- Please delete the text above after you verified all points of the checklist  -->\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_13_0_7_TOTEM_X", "changed_files": 77, "comments": 14, "commits": 34, "created_at": "1686383155", "deletions": 216755, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "l1-pending", "hlt-pending", "alca-pending", "daq-pending", "generators-pending", "operations-pending", "reconstruction-approved", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "urgent", "backport-ok", "ctpps", "tracking"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "number": 41916, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Backport for Totem T2, to be used in the special run at 25.6, consisting of #41472 , #41777 and #41859", "updated_at": "1686571928", "user": "oljemark"}

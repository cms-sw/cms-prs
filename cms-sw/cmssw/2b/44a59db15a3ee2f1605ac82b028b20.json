This makes it much easier to identify where any instance of this class is modified.  This is important for the multithreaded framework, in that this class is used in the ProductRegistry, which is accessible across threads. This code has been tested.  Unit tests and relvals all pass.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 19, "closed_at": "1373634922", "comments": 7, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1373510621", "deletions": 140, "labels": [], "number": 77, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Make BranchDescription not mutable", "updated_at": "1406834492", "user": "wmtan"}

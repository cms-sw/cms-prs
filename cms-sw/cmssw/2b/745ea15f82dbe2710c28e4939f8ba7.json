MC requires a near-future PR to have non-zero Minimum bias bits.\n\nThis algorithm was tested against the currently running L1 Firmware by Ben Kreis and I. \n\n@mulhearn You should probably sign off on this.\n\nExpect to see backport PRs for 75X and 74X shortly.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1441168289", "comments": 26, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1439308944", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "ae78c36fde311559de7f1b1eaca716b48d8f2305", "merged_at": "1441168289", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 10695, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "Add HF Minimum Bias algorithm to Stage1 Emulator", "updated_at": "1441168289", "user": "richard-cms"}

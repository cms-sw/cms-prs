Each CSC chamber will send 4 bits per bunch crossing to the Muon Port Card, and to the Muon Track Finder Sector Processors. These bits are called ```TMBi\\_HMT[3:0]``` for each MPC. In the simulation, they are contained in the new CSCShowerDigi data format. Two bits are allocated for in-time; two bits for out-of-time. Documentation can be found here: [DN-20-033](https://gitlab.cern.ch/tdr/notes/DN-20-033/blob/master/temp/DN-20-033_temp.pdf).\r\n\r\n<img width=\"516\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-04-09 at 2 04 03 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4134786/114228713-7aaa4a00-993c-11eb-88fe-709aa5dffa01.png\">\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles. Tested with WF 11634.0.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nN/A. We expect the (local trigger, track-finder, uGMT) firmware to be available by Summer 2021. I'll first develop the entire emulator in 11_3_X, then backport if need be.\r\n\r\nBefore submitting your pull requests, make sure you followed this checklist:\r\n- verify that the PR is really intended for the chosen branch\r\n- verify that changes follow [CMS Naming, Coding, And Style Rules](http://cms-sw.github.io/cms_coding_rules.html)\r\n- verify that the PR passes the basic test procedure suggested in the [CMSSW PR instructions](https://cms-sw.github.io/PRWorkflow.html)\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1618264934", "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1617988029", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "2ed4aa243140ecdba6ff306789489e69969796c8", "merged_at": "1618264934", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 33389, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "CSCShowerDigi data format (HadronicShowerTrigger-1)", "updated_at": "1618264934", "user": "dildick"}

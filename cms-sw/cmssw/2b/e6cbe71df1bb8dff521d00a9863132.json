Using the `EDPutToken` instead of carrying the strings with product names around makes this a bit clearer I think, so this PR suggests to use the `EDPutToken` for all products.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the `GEDPhotonCoreProducer` module is modernized, and includes of `*Handle.h` are avoided in the package, because these includes are necessarily inherited from the inclusion of `Event.h` or `EventSetup.h`.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCMSSW compiles, local matrix tests pass.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nNo backport intended.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1611074981", "comments": 25, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1610297124", "deletions": 352, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "abc5bb8bde961e9acd82ac3ba6ffec99c964fd1d", "merged_at": "1611074981", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 32626, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 7, "state": "closed", "title": "Use EDPutToken in ReducedEGProducer and modernize GEDPhotonCoreProducer", "updated_at": "1611074981", "user": "guitargeek"}

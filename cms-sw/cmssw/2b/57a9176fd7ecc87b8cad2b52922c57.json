Previously it was purely based on the match to the key half-strip.\r\n- The class CSCComparatorDigiFitter is redundant and can be deleted.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested in CMSSW_11_1_0_pre6 using events in the Run-3 MC data set `/JPsiToMuMu_Pt0to100-pythia8_TuneCP5-gun/Run3Winter20DRMiniAOD-DRFlatPU30to80_110X_mcRun3_2021_realistic_v6-v2/GEN-SIM-RAW`\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n@tahuang1991 ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 15, "closed_at": "1590561284", "comments": 25, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1589389081", "deletions": 390, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "ca1e6cb4685c35f3be6f08d93511179a8e869f6a", "merged_at": "1590561283", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 29830, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Improve Simtrack to GEM/CSC digi and stub matching (CCLUT-4.5)", "updated_at": "1594306945", "user": "dildick"}

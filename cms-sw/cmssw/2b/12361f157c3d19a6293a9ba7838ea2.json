The feature was developed several years ago in simulation intended for the SLHC version of the CSC local trigger algorithm. However, it was not developed in the Verilog firmware for data taking. In all likelihood it will not be developed in the future either. Because certain features in the SLHC algorithm are currently being tested on 2018D pp collision data, we decided to remove the `smartME1aME1b` feature in simulation to allow for accurate data vs emulator studies. \r\n\r\nIn addition, I modified `CSCMotherboardME11` so that it inherits from `CSCUpgradeMotherboard`.  A redundant LUT (called `time_weights`) was also removed. \r\n\r\nIn the near future I plan to enable the upgrade algorithm for all ME1/1 trigger motherboards and CLCT processors. Since the ALCT processor firmware code has not been developed, the ALCT upgrade simulation will not be deployed during Run-2 (most likely during LS2).\r\n\r\nThis PR must be included after #24402 and #24403 (rebase will be required).  \r\n\r\n@tahuang1991 @lpernie ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 24, "closed_at": "1539194466", "comments": 104, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1535663785", "deletions": 1852, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "52e9fa5ee041ab5792d6a3861312bbb4981c2a1d", "merged_at": "1539194466", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_4_X", "number": 24422, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": " Remove smartME1aME1b in ME1/1.

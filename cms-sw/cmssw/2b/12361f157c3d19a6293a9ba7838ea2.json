The feature was developed several years ago in simulation intended for the SLHC version of the CSC local trigger algorithm. However, it was never developed in the Verilog firmware. Still, parts of the SLHC algorithm are currently being tested using 2018D collision data. Hence, the decision to remove it in the simulation version so that it allows for accurate data vs emulator studies. \r\n\r\nIn addition, I modified `CSCMotherboardME11` so that it inherits from `CSCUpgradeMotherboard`.  A redundant LUT (`time_weights`) was also removed. \r\n\r\nIn the near future I plan to enable the upgrade algorithm for all ME1/1 trigger motherboards and CLCT processors. Since the ALCT processor firmware code has not been developed, ALCT upgrade simulation will not be deployed during Run-2 (most likely during LS2).\r\n\r\nThis PR must be included after #24402 and #24403 (rebase will be required).  \r\n\r\n@tahuang1991 @lpernie ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 24, "comments": 76, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1535663785", "deletions": 1852, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "hold", "l1-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_3_X", "number": 24422, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": " Remove smartME1aME1b in ME1/1.

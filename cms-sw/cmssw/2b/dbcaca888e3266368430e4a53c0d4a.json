This requires a small change to `EDProducerBase` so producers are informed of the number of threads in the current configuration.\r\n\r\nGenerators that are ready to run multi-process / multi-threaded will use this extra argument; otherwise, this is ignored.\r\n\r\n@bendavid - does this reflect what we were discussing in email?  Anything I missed?  Do you have a suggested `cmsDriver` command I could run to validate?  I'm afraid I don't have deep knowledge on the generators...\r\n\r\n@sextonkennedy - this is a follow-up from our discussion in December with @Dr15Jones; Josh had suggested that the most expedient route would be for me to attempt the changes.", "branch": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "changed_files": 9, "closed_at": "1484985913", "comments": 17, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1484878794", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["comparison-available", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "generators-approved", "orp-pending", "tests-rejected"], "merge_commit_sha": "055a6f5eb6d1f0288dd41a20aa8edcb304714e5f", "merged_at": "1484985913", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "number": 17217, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Pass thread count to gridpack run scripts.", "updated_at": "1484985913", "user": "bbockelm"}

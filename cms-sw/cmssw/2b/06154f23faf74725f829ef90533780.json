We also adapted the ngt client to include the beamspot and MetaDataDigis.\r\n\r\nWe also removed the `onlyScouting` condition everywhere as we now do save the online lumi metadata so it is no longer needed.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis PR was developed in `CMSSW_16_1_X_2026-01-20-2300`, using the packages `DQM/Integration` and `DQM/HLTEvF`.\r\n\r\nWe validated by creating streamer files in `398183` for the ngt-client and then running the following test:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncmsRun DQM/Integration/python/clients/ngt_dqm_sourceclient-live_cfg.py runInputDir=DQM-Integration runNumber=398183 scanOnce=True\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

A check and exception message has been added to ensure that the program terminates safely, does not experience a memory leak and \r\n- This does not resolve the non-existence of `associatorByHits ` in the Run 3 workflow. It is believed that the case has been identified. @kpedro88 and @davidcarbonis are working on this and a separate PR is planned to be opened to resolve this.\r\n\r\nOther outstanding issues:\r\n- The random differences noted in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/19811#issuecomment-316617004 in \"PixelPhase1V/Run summary/TrackingParticle\" between unrelated PRs, have not been forgotten but still need to be understood.\r\n\r\n@davidlange6: I shall provide bin info shortly.\r\n\r\n@fioriNTU will be interested in this.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1502346504", "comments": 9, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1501588549", "deletions": 95, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "1551b7509db5f8e583fa79fb943b645a799e5f7b", "merged_at": "1502346504", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_3_X", "number": 19992, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "PixelPhase Validation bin reduction and protection against memory leak.", "updated_at": "1502346504", "user": "davidcarbonis"}

It includes several changes:\r\n\r\n* The HGCAL clustering algorithms are now treated as plugins used by the central LayerCluster producer. This required quite some files reshuffling around packages.\r\n* The Validation of the configuration of the algorithm is done using the central Plugin Parameter Validation.\r\n* The default clustering algorithm has been changed. Now we use the CLUE (clustering energy) algorithm. The results of this are much better if compared to the up-to-now default one. Results have been presented in the HGCAL DPG Meeting [See here, slides 42 onward](https://indico.cern.ch/event/803066/contributions/3341958/attachments/1807341/2950233/20190306_HGCAL_DPG_ImagingAlgoModification_MR.pdf)\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested using:\r\n\r\n- [x] scram b code-checks\r\n- [x] runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 33, "comments": 9, "commits": 59, "created_at": "1552650835", "deletions": 220, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "dqm-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "tests-approved", "upgrade-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 26194, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "HGCAL Clue algorithm 106 x", "updated_at": "1552663270", "user": "rovere"}

The only thing it adds is\n- an \"--era\" option to cmsDriver\n- 3 blank eras (i.e. they don't do anything yet) - `run2`, `bunchspacing25ns` and `bunchspacing50ns`\n- a new customise function `customiseRun2EraExtras` which currently is a direct copy of `customisePostLS1`\n\n`bunchspacing25ns` and `bunchspacing50ns` are not intended to be specified by the user, ConfigBuilder adds them automatically depending on what pileup is requested.\n`run2` will eventually be the `customisePostLS1` customisation implemented as an era.  Each portion will be added incrementally in further pull requests.  Until it is complete, the `customiseRun2EraExtras` customisation can be used to do the parts that haven't been implemented yet (currently everything).\nSo commands that originally had\n\n```\n--customise SLHCUpgradeSimulations/Configuration/postLS1Customs.customisePostLS1\n```\n\ncan be tested using eras with:\n\n```\n--era run2 --customise SLHCUpgradeSimulations/Configuration/postLS1Customs.customiseRun2EraExtras\n```\n\nEventually when `run2` is fully implemented the customisation will not be required.\n\nI tested the 1320.0 workflow (since it is one of the postLS1 ones) with and without the above replacement, then diff-ed the resulting configuration files and diff-ed the result of applying `edmConfigDump` on those files.  There is absolutely no difference in the dumps, for the files themselves there are small expected differences (different customisation name, run2 era specified).  Note that diff equivalency is not expected once `run2` actually does something, for reasons that will be explained in the relevant subsequent pull requests.\n\n@davidlange6, @Dr15Jones\n\n@franzoni - this is just the core parts, it doesn't show how to use the eras yet.  I'll ping you again when there is a good example (or you can look at #6784 but there's a lot in there to wade through).\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1422532023", "comments": 8, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1422447944", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "operations-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "219353281bfc3c9089da6bd77256415c3a9768f1", "merged_at": "1422532023", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 7419, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Implement postLS1 as an Era - core parts", "updated_at": "1423154168", "user": "mark-grimes"}

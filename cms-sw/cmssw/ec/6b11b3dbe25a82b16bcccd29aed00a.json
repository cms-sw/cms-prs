Two separate models were developed: one for trackster energy regression and another for particle identification. These models are integrated into different reconstruction steps, specifically CLU3D (pattern recognition) and trackster linking. To optimize processing time, the models are saved in ONNX format.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, a new inference plugin has been implemented to run these models, now serving as the default for TICLv5.\r\n\r\n-This PR needs to be tested with the following cms-data PR: https://github.com/cms-data/RecoHGCal-TICL/pull/8\r\n\r\n-Additionally, this PR should be tested on the .203 workflow :\r\n\r\n-test parameters:\r\nworkflow_opts= -w upgrade\r\nworkflow = 29888.203,29688.203\r\n\r\nTagging @felicepantaleo @waredjeb @hatakeyamak", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 14, "comments": 21, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1741638513", "deletions": 37, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "hlt-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "upgrade-pending", "requires-external", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 47550, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Integrating Particle Flow Network (PFN) Models into TICLv5 ", "updated_at": "1741693739", "user": "Moanwar"}

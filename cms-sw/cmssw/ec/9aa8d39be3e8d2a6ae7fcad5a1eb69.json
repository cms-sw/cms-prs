This PR combines the time fro the hits associated to a track in two discs by extrapolating the outermost to the innermost, and computing a weighted average. The uncertainty in the subtracted time-of-flight between the two discs induced by the mass hypothesis (pion is used for the extrapolation) is added in the form of the difference between the pion and proton estimated tof. This has very small effect but for very soft tracks.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles and runs, debugging printouts show the desired behaviour on wf 34634.0.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1617086432", "comments": 31, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1616173986", "deletions": 21, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "cf12d2ab4784b6016cbefc6cacc2398f148b7eea", "merged_at": "1617086432", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 33226, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 15, "state": "closed", "title": "MTD reconstruction: combine the time fro two ETL discs in TrackExtenderWithMTD", "updated_at": "1617086432", "user": "fabiocos"}

The reason is that `11634.0` is used in the current RelVal production and then we want the corresponding `11634.911`. Same thing for `11642.911` which has been moved to 14 TeV `11650.911`. The short matrix has been updated accordingly.\r\nThe PR has been tested simply with `runTheMatrix.py -l 11634.911,11650.911`", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1613064371", "comments": 16, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1612889482", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "orp-approved", "pdmv-approved", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "upgrade-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "a09e085e7b468f5f35c27a777e8412bc5e351ed8", "merged_at": "1613064370", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 32857, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 4, "state": "closed", "title": "Move DD4Hep workflows from 13TeV to 14TeV", "updated_at": "1613064371", "user": "silviodonato"}

The code is however deactivated for now pending FW demonstration.\r\n\r\nThe PR also integrates some validation code (ntuples) not consumed in any production workflow.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n![canvas(168)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4802196/91179907-6ab06380-e6e7-11ea-8f22-8e7312260a10.png)\r\n\r\n![canvas(169)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4802196/91179887-608e6500-e6e7-11ea-950c-2f63bf299754.png)\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 14, "closed_at": "1599485408", "comments": 31, "commits": 12, "created_at": "1598355566", "deletions": 18, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "57c2d9f18ef0ebae325f7766a4f6175e18ada517", "merged_at": "1599485408", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 31235, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 17, "state": "closed", "title": "L1T EG Phase2 Track match and EG validation code", "updated_at": "1599485408", "user": "cerminar"}

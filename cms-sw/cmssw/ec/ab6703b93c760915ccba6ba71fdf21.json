By filling the numerator histograms with weighted events, according to that prescale, the reduction effect is corrected.\r\n- **Better tuning of the offline selections** (especially the dimuon invariant masses), to select the correct regions where to compute the efficiency. This helps in some modules to select a pure region for the signal, in other modules (based on background events) to select the appropriate kinematic region.\r\n- **Customised and optimised binning**: to reduce the global number of bins, especially where they are not needed, the binning of the histograms has been refined\r\n- **Removal of few meaningless efficiencies**: some modules defined in the list of the cff file (devoted to the L1 efficiency of dR(MuMu) cut in 2mu+trk triggers) have been removed, since their efficiency definition is not correct (using at denominator a 2mu trigger, they will always be biased by the inefficiency of the track reconstruction at HLT)\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 7, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1531809105", "deletions": 754, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "dqm-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 23807, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Improvements and fixes for the BPH-trigger offline DQM code (v2)", "updated_at": "1531821035", "user": "aboletti"}

Of course, by default it is set to true, but for the HLT menu it would temporarily be set to false.\r\n\r\nAs a bonus, it would cleanly allow to separate studies with timing from MTD vs timing from HGCAL, in the context of the HLT menu evolution. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nDid the full tests:\r\n```\r\ncmsrel CMSSW_12_3_DEVEL_X_2022-03-06-2300\r\ncd CMSSW_12_3_DEVEL_X_2022-03-06-2300/src\r\ngit cms-init\r\ngit merge trtomei/devel_trtomei_TICL-MTD-optional\r\nscram b distclean \r\ngit cms-checkdeps -a -A\r\nscram b -j 8\r\nscram b runtests\r\n```\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n`runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos`\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 17, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1646655471", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "upgrade-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 37158, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "open", "title": "Adding optionality for MTD timing in PFTICLProducer", "updated_at": "1646813700", "user": "trtomei"}

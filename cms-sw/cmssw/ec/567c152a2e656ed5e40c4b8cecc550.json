As discussed with @bendavid, @Sam-Harper, @slava77 and @hatakeyamak, a clean-up of the legacy PF egamma code is on our todo list for the 11XY cycle.\r\n\r\nI keep things minimal for now so it can be easily reviewed and keep the risk of differences minimal:\r\n* remove the PFElectronAlgo and PFPhotonAlgo classes\r\n* remove PFAlgo code that requires any of the two classes (could easily be spotted by `usePFPhotons_` or `usePFPElectrons_`)\r\n* remove the configuration for these algos from PFProducer\r\n* in passing, merge the PFProducer.h file with the PFProducer.cc file\r\n\r\nOf course what's still missing is cleaning up the configurations from now unused parameters, of better even implement a `fillDescriptions` method for the PFProducer. However, this would require editing various HLT configs which are huge and tedious to edit, so I think that action could be for another PF (or this one after initial tests pass and no differences are observed).\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/26658.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCMSSW compiles and matrix tests pass.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\n\r\nNo backport is intended.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 16, "closed_at": "1558463781", "comments": 31, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1558036118", "deletions": 5694, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "863ca6a161614b5de4c54b8634c511ff54ea5014", "merged_at": "1558463780", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 26813, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Remove PFElectronAlgo and PFPhotonAlgo used back in Run 1", "updated_at": "1558463781", "user": "guitargeek"}

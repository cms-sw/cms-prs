A new, configurable interface for the geometry of the fastsim tracker was developed. To this end, it was necessary to also write a new algorithm for the propagation of the particles inside the tracker.\r\nThe package is created inside it's own namespace so none of the standard fastsim code is affected. This allows for easy comparison/validation of the new geometry/particle propagation.\r\n\r\nThe geometry of the detector used to be hard-coded but can now be specified in a single python file (FastSimulation/Geometry/python/TrackerMaterial_cfi.py)\r\n\r\nMotivation for a new algorithm (particle propagation inside the tracker)\r\n- almost impossible to adjust the old algorithm to the new, configurable geometry (hard-coded links have to be omitted)\r\n- old algorithm is flawed\r\n- the new algorithm allows to put material and instruments on any plane perpendicular to z, or on any cylinder with the z-axis as axis \r\n- while the old algorithm, with the requirement of nested layers, forbids the introduction of long narrow cylinders, required for a decent simulation of material in front of HF\nAutomatically ported from CMSSW_9_0_X #17201 (original by @skurz).\nPlease wait for a new IB (12 to 24H) before requesting to test this PR.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 111, "closed_at": "1489662012", "comments": 13, "commits": 16, "created_at": "1488454630", "deletions": 2834, "labels": ["alca-pending", "analysis-pending", "comparison-pending", "fastsim-pending", "hlt-pending", "new-package-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-rejected", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending", "upgrade-rejected"], "milestone": "CMSSW_9_1_X", "number": 17732, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "New, configurable interface for fastsim geometry", "updated_at": "1489662012", "user": "cmsbuild"}

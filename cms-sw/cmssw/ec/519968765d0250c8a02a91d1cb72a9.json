Enable GenErrors database object for generic CPE, which are faster than the full template database objects previously used.\n2. Enable to take the lorentz angle width from database (instead of configuration)\n3. Enable lorentz angle estimate from alignment from database. Currently database entries are 0 such that this has no effect until alignment input.\nIt was checked that none of these features changes pixel cluster position resolution within 1% of the resolution.\nAutomatically ported from CMSSW_7_2_X #5238\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_3_X", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1413868554", "comments": 55, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1410974336", "deletions": 8, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "96447be05f549a3c9e0e6453707a86d01fc38be7", "merged_at": "1413868554", "merged_by": "nclopezo", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_3_X", "number": 5384, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Enable new pixel cluster position features", "updated_at": "1413958821", "user": "cmsbuild"}

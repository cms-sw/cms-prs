Previous to this it just resulted\nin an error being printed out.\n\nFixed HcalDigisValidation which had recently added\na getByLabel without a consumes call. Also fixed\ntwo Framework unit tests that also had problems with\nconsumes calls.\n\nThis has been tested to not cause problems in the\nIB by scanning all the log files of a recent\nIB for the error message. Framework unit tests\nalso pass.\n\nWhile this should cause no IB test failures, there\nprobably will be failures of other code not tested\nin the IBs which has not been migrated to declare\nthe products it consumes.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 8, "closed_at": "1439443135", "comments": 14, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1439230588", "deletions": 17, "labels": ["alca-pending", "comparison-available", "core-approved", "dqm-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "a35816aec7949848966941f3ff332247c985d506", "merged_at": "1439443135", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 10661, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Make missing consumes calls an exception", "updated_at": "1474632210", "user": "wddgit"}

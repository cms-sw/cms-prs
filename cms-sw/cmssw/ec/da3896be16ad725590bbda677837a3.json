This caused infinite loops when filling gen status flags. (at either gen-sim or digi-reco time).\nProtections have been added for this now.\n\nBecause the protections require some dynamically allocated space to keep track of the particles, implementing this efficiently required transitioning from a namespace to a class for MCTruthHelper.\n\nVerified that there are no changes in flags for pythia8 samples where circular relations were not present.\n\nThis is a generalized fix which supersedes the more specific protection in\nhttps://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/9272\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1433768580", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1433688550", "deletions": 436, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "8fb4b9de64c4b6bb096725512523e04465264b5d", "merged_at": "1433768580", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 9489, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Protect against infinite loops in gen status flag code", "updated_at": "1433768581", "user": "bendavid"}

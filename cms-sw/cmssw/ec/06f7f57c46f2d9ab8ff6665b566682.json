There was a bug where it returns FileOpenError in the fallback case.\r\n\r\nThere is more discussion and more information related to this bug in issue https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/42040. FYI @stlammel\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nIncludes new unit test. New unit test and existing tests pass. This should only affect the behavior after an exception occurs. It should not affect the output of successful cmsRun processes.\r\n\r\nBackport of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/42249. (I had to modify the unit test a little to get it to work in 12_4_X).\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1690484760", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["core-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "backport-ok"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 42396, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Fix error code on fallback file open error with test, 12_4_X backport", "updated_at": "1692641446", "user": "wddgit"}

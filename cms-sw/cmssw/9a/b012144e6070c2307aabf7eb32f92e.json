This pull request simply adds the new data member.  It does not actually use it yet.\nIt is convenient to add the data member separately, because modifying TypeWithDict.h here causes over 820 packages to rebuild.  Once this request is in an IB, the feature can then be developed and tested without further modifying a header file.\nPlease merge this tivial request as soon as convenient.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_ROOT6_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1419800712", "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1419797752", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "core-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "401a5cd569fc4c1c593f57338aef5dca154f5757", "merged_at": "1419800712", "merged_by": "davidlt", "number": 7017, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add array dimension information", "updated_at": "1419863062", "user": "wmtan"}

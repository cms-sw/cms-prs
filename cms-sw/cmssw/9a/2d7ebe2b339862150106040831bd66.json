There are two xml files now, one for EE and one for HE.\n- DDAngular positioning is implied.\n- Names of EE and HE as well as path from Top CMS volume\n  to HGCalEE and HGCalHE is specified.\n- Materials for GEM parts are coming from the global list.\n- There is parameters section, as a reference on what was assumed for geometry description. The most important is the specification of the first/last volume number for given Solid (to be used in a sensitive volume declaration), see vectors.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1387266208", "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1386751793", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["geometry-approved", "new-package-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "7fb86f85525085b7e8cb263fd98e6872d204b526", "merged_at": "1387266208", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "number": 1763, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Recent development from Valeri", "updated_at": "1445873366", "user": "ianna"}

This allows making graph objects constant in global caches when running multi-threaded.\r\n\r\nThe change was suggested in [#32222  (comment)](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/32222/files#r529850491) and https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/32128#issuecomment-726425146 and could benefit the ongoing integrations.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation\r\n\r\nThe tests coming with the TF interface itself were not changed and still pass as changes are minimal and predictable.\r\n\r\n@mialiu149 @makortel @vlimant ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1606431539", "comments": 18, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1606254786", "deletions": 10, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "dfe3fbe613475651701ea9659c24539d9f57d68c", "merged_at": "1606431539", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 32271, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "[TF] Accept const graphs in session creation", "updated_at": "1606431539", "user": "riga"}

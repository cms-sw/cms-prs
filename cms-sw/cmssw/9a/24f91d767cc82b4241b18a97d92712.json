Main ingredients:\r\n\r\n* Remove full Tracking sequence from Muon paths that do not use it\r\n* Remove `hltEcalUncalibRecHit` module as a duplicate of `ecalMultiFitUncalibRecHit`\r\n* Optimally reorder filters in Egamma Paths by running full tracking at the very end, before the last filter that needs tracks.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested using HLT Upgrade Simplified menu.\r\n\r\nWith these changes, the timing as measured on my development machine went down quite a bit:\r\n\r\n![before](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/assets/1169991/ecbec2ad-0b4d-454d-8453-f59b6903267d)\r\n![after](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/assets/1169991/e90e3914-ffb6-4b2b-a607-b278828895f2)\r\n\r\n**Nota Bene:** For the timing measurements above, the Tau paths have been disabled temporarily because they were causing the triggering of full tracking on all events. This will likely be fixed once L1 seeding for Tau paths is introduced.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 14, "comments": 1, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1711173835", "deletions": 123, "labels": ["hlt-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 44523, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Fix sequences in HLT Upgrade simplified menu", "updated_at": "1711173862", "user": "rovere"}

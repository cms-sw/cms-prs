The validation was presented at the [12 December 2019 PPD meeting](https://indico.cern.ch/event/863633/contributions/3670489/attachments/1961044/3259253/PPD_12_12_2019.pdf). These tags have already been included in the `106X_dataRun2_v26` GT used in the [2018D UL reprocessing](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/CMS/PdmVDataReprocessingUL2018#cmsdrivers) but the changes had not yet been propagated to autoCond in master.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the name of the offline GTs have been updated to reflect that these GTs should be used for 11_1_X only. This isn't really necessary for this PR but rather is done because the name change should have been made already in PR #28825, which was not intended to be backported to 11_0_X.\r\n\r\nThe GT diffs are as follows:\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/110X_dataRun2_v10/111X_dataRun2_v1\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/110X_dataRun2_HEfail_v1/111X_dataRun2_HEfail_v1 \r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/110X_dataRun2_relval_v10/111X_dataRun2_relval_v1\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nIn addition to the validation mentioned above, a technical test was performed: `runTheMatrix.py -l limited --ibeos`.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nThis PR is not a backport but it will be backported to 11_0_X.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1582031361", "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1581997515", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "7c4b4b7040744657d4eff5b71349e167790b88c4", "merged_at": "1582031361", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 28981, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Correct ECAL timing calibration for Run2018D", "updated_at": "1582031361", "user": "christopheralanwest"}

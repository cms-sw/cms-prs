This PR also replaces the use of `cudaStreamAddCallback()` with `edm::async()` accompanied with `cudaEventSynchronize()`, and makes the CUDA/Alpaka events to be created with `cudaEventBlockingSync` flag.\r\n\r\nMeasurements that I showed in CHEP 2023 https://indico.jlab.org/event/459/contributions/11810/ suggested possible 1 % throughput improvement at the HLT (of that time, many things have changed since) over `cudaStreamAddCallback()`. Earlier studies done with a prototype in https://github.com/cms-patatrack/pixeltrack-standalone/pull/321 that somehow the thread pool with `cudaEventSynchronize()` used less CPU than `cudaStreamAddCallback()`.\r\n\r\nDuring the CHEP study I also tested polling with `cudaEventQuery()`, but the \"waiting thread pool\" approach was more performant.\r\n\r\nAnother benefit over `cudaStreamAddCallback()` is that that function \"is slated for eventual deprecation and removal\", and the \"replacement\" `cudaLaunchHostFunc()` does not call the callback function in case of an error in the associated CUDA stream.\r\n\r\nResolves https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/29188\r\nResolves https://github.com/cms-sw/framework-team/issues/916\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nUnit tests in `FWCore/Concurrency`, `HeterogeneousCore/Alpaka{Core,Test}`, `HeterogeneousCore/CUDA{Utilities,Core,Test}` succeed.\r\n\r\n**The deployment on CUDA and Alpaka modules still needs performance testing**\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

In the previous version of the code, this was done only if the anode was actually present in the digis. With this update, the status will be propagated to the rechit even if that anode is not in the data stream (but its neighbor anode is). This will make a difference for \"dead\" channels flagged in DB.\r\n\r\nSince, at the moment, there are no bad channels flagged in the DB for HF, this PR will not change any relval results.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1496334178", "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1496069233", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "f059e5d540285b3cf3ed3096ea27ef7b5f71630b", "merged_at": "1496334178", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_2_X", "number": 18996, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Adding anode DB suppression status to the rechits", "updated_at": "1496334178", "user": "igv4321"}

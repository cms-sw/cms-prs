More technical information can be found in this talk: https://indico.cern.ch/event/1336796/#45-studies-on-trigger-efficien\r\n-  The minETA default value is set to 0.0 to keep other HLT paths which use this filter (like HLT_MET105_IsoTrk50_v13) unaffected\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nValidated and tested with `hltGetConfiguration`\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

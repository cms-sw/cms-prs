I only see usage of this in `DQM/Integration/python/config`, so I was wondering if it is correct or it might cause problems. The options are needed to properly setup the `OnlineDBOutputService`.\r\n\r\n2. **For DB experts:**\r\nI'm not sure how to properly configure these lines in `OnlineDBOutputService`:\r\n  - `authenticationPath`\r\n  - `lastLumiFile`\r\n  - `connect` and `preLoadConnectionString`\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Backporting:\r\nOnce this PR is completed and merged, it will need a backport to CMSSW_11_1\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 13, "closed_at": "1594118649", "comments": 66, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1593421513", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "f95d44a2c490d73308fbcc7d941b91aa6c76b804", "merged_at": "1594118648", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 30448, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": " BeamSpotOnline in DQM beamspot clients", "updated_at": "1594118649", "user": "francescobrivio"}

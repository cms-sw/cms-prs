As stated in its comment, the field ndof is sometimes used with vertex indices (and hence not used fully). This could be reviewed separately.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nAll unit tests from affected modules pass.\r\n\r\nBackport of #43952 to 14_0_X\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "changed_files": 20, "comments": 4, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1708004291", "deletions": 108, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "dqm-pending", "hlt-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "heterogeneous-pending", "tracking", "trk"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "number": 43980, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 4, "state": "open", "title": "Z vertex multi layout 14 0 x (backport #43952)", "updated_at": "1708037098", "user": "ericcano"}

This was inevitable, and unavoidable.  The 2016 emulator (with data formats) had 143 files.  The 2017 emulator (with helper files for trigger primitives) has 126.  So that's 269 out of the 295 total files changed.  The remainder come from moving some files out of a deprecate folder (which have been, and continue to be in use), and changes for the new O2O/CondFormats files which are inseparable from the new emulator.**\r\n\r\nI've tried to make it quite simple to track which changes happened where by grouping them in easy-to-understand commits:\r\nhttps://github.com/abrinke1/cmssw/commits/EMTF_PR_2017_93X_part8c\r\n\r\nOf course, it's still a lot of code to review.  I suppose the first thing, though, is to figure out what the conflicts are that prevent this branch from being merged in its current state.  It merges, compiles, and runs fine on CMSSW_9_3_0_pre4.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nAndrew", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 232, "closed_at": "1507480933", "comments": 132, "commits": 20, "created_at": "1503929648", "deletions": 29555, "labels": ["alca-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "db-pending", "dqm-pending", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "pending-signatures", "requires-external", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "b3b7d360de5cea2df9e92677ef6cc28ef0124188", "merged_at": "1507480933", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_4_X", "number": 20286, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 12, "state": "closed", "title": "EMTF 2017 PR #6 - Emulator", "updated_at": "1507534354", "user": "abrinke1"}

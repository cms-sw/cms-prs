A new DataFormat has been included, a new producer with underlying algos. New sequences  have been added and the central ecalDigi_cff has been updated to include the new sequences. Also the SimCalorimetry_EventContent has been updated to include the new collection (EcalEBClusterTriggerPrimitiveDigis)  of trigger primitives. This new collection does NOT replace the one previously deployed (i.e. EcalEBTriggerPrimitiveDigis). It is meant to be produced in parallel (at least for the time being) to allow for studies and/or further development. In the longer term a choice will be made", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 37, "comments": 27, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1526474805", "deletions": 237, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "l1-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending", "upgrade-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 23219, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 103, "state": "open", "title": "New PhaseII Ecal barrel trigger primitives from clusters ", "updated_at": "1526643266", "user": "nancymarinelli"}

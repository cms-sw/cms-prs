Modified on top of the default tracking algorithm from standard pp tracking. \r\n- The TrackingRegion parameters are modified to reduce the timing on these 3 iterations above, e.g., the minPt and originHalfLength. \r\n- A \"scaling\" function has been implemented (in this file GlobalTrackingRegionWithVerticesProducer.h), where according to the number of pixel clusters (mostly for more central heavy ion events), the TrackingRegion parameters, e.g., minPt, originRadius, originHalfLength, are scaled up (pt) or down (originRaidu or originHalfLength) linearly above a certain threshold (for example Npix=20000). Therefore the timing can be greatly reduced towards very central events. \r\n\r\nSupporting presentations:\r\n- Performance plots on efficiency, fake rate, secondary rate (where it matters), https://indico.cern.ch/event/699094/contributions/2867255/attachments/1587914/2512006/Tracking_PR_preparation.pdf\r\nNote that the comparison here is to compare \"default\" values from the standard pp tracking vs the modified values in the TrackingRegion parameters of the added iterations. \r\n\r\n- Study of V0s in terms of added 3 iterations:\r\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/638128/contributions/2585615/attachments/1460150/2255756/Tracking_6_90X.pdf\r\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/646309/contributions/2625076/attachments/1475706/2285788/Tracking_7_90X.pdf\r\n\r\n- Timing study as a function of Npix, https://indico.cern.ch/event/699094/contributions/2867255/attachments/1587914/2511992/Timing_displacedTracking_Jan24.pdf\r\n\r\n\r\n@abaty @mandrenguyen ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 8, "closed_at": "1518800456", "comments": 71, "commits": 19, "created_at": "1516730928", "deletions": 203, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "f97ecf7ca35833253e4405ab00f0b904c84d5aec", "merged_at": "1518800456", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_1_X", "number": 21930, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 30, "state": "closed", "title": "Displace-tracking development in heavy ion tracking ", "updated_at": "1518800457", "user": "KongTu"}

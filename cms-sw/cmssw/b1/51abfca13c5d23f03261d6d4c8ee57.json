This test was try to connect to oracle DB at non-existing server `c`. But since 8th of May, now there is a real server `c` which is causing this test to fail. The change makes sure that we use a more random DB name with possibility to change it via `CMSTEST_FAKE_ORACLE_DBNAME` env (if needed in future).\r\n\r\nOnce this is merged in master IBs then I will open backport PRs for old release cycles too.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1683828223", "comments": 7, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1683807302", "deletions": 19, "labels": ["fully-signed", "tests-approved", "db-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "9556ab969f11914c1583f8f720bf7f36b4269479", "merged_at": "1683828223", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_13_2_X", "number": 41630, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Oracle test: Use fake/random DB name", "updated_at": "1683828224", "user": "smuzaffar"}

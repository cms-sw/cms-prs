This idea can be used in the future to migrate the current implementation of several UserHooks that are currently hard-coded.\r\n\r\n- A module dedicated to soft unclustered energy pattern (SUEP or soft-bombs)-like decays, following the description of [1612.00850](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00850). It can be used to decay an SM particle through a soft-bomb shower. \r\n  - The suep shower code ([header](https://github.com/cericeci/cmssw/blob/SUEPpythia_dev/GeneratorInterface/Pythia8Interface/interface/suep_shower.h) and [source](https://github.com/cericeci/cmssw/blob/SUEPpythia_dev/GeneratorInterface/Pythia8Interface/src/suep_shower.cc)) is taken directly from [Simon Knapen's implementation](https://gitlab.com/simonknapen/suep_generator). As a consequence it does not follow cms' code standards. Should it be adapted as well?\r\n  - The module uses the previously discussed PluginFactory to be included inside the Pythia8Hadronizer and can be used for decays of ME obtained from either pythia or a LHE producer such as madgraph. An example of its usage can be found [here](https://github.com/cericeci/cmssw/blob/SUEPpythia_devtests/GeneratorInterface/Pythia8Interface/test/suep_decay.py). It's usage is based on the inclusion of the following lines inside the process.generator inside the fragment:\r\n```\r\n        UserCustomization = cms.VPSet(\r\n           cms.PSet(\r\n             pluginName = cms.string(\"SuepDecay\"),\r\n             idDark = cms.int32(999999), # pdgId of the dark meson\r\n             idMediator = cms.int32(25), # pdgId of the mediator\r\n             temperature = cms.double(2) # Temperature of the thermal distribution\r\n           )\r\n``` \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode-checks passed, unit tests passed. \r\nTests using a [local config file](https://github.com/cericeci/cmssw/blob/SUEPpythia_devtests/GeneratorInterface/Pythia8Interface/test/suep_decay.py) show that the SUEP module properly decays the Higgs boson.\r\n\r\n#### Backporting:\r\n\r\nOnce this is merged we aim for a backport to 10_6_X for UL MC production.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 8, "closed_at": "1638861588", "comments": 18, "commits": 11, "created_at": "1637773276", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["generators-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "c763b5add2f9ca3fc944e3adaaf9f321808fd42d", "merged_at": "1638861588", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 36238, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Factory for adding UserHooks to PythiaHadronizer and SUEP decay pythia Hook", "updated_at": "1638861589", "user": "cericeci"}

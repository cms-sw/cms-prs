The tiny rotation should not have any noticeable effects, but it will cause a numerical change in the DD4hep XML geometry.\r\n\r\nThis backport also includes PR #35299 that increases the precision of rotation matching when creating the DD4hep big XML file for the DB. This change has no effect on workflows, since it only revises the tool that is run when a new DD4hep big XML file is needed for uploading into the DB.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nA test DD4hep big XML file was created with this PR in 12_0, and it exactly matches the 12_1 version.", "branch": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1632846645", "deletions": 46, "labels": ["geometry-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "backport-ok"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "number": 35456, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[DD4hep] [Backport] Enable tiny rotation of 3 volumes and increase precision of rotation matching", "updated_at": "1632846774", "user": "cvuosalo"}

Add option to match jets by delta-R (the plugin uses two jet collections: the first one is a simple jet collection, the second one is the \"key\" of a `JetTagCollection` whose values as the jet b-tagging scores).\r\n> 2. If delta-R matching is not used (not using delta-R matching remains the default behaviour), the (b-)tag value of the jet is accessed via the method `edm::AssociationVector::operator[]`. This requires that the input jet collection is the same as the \"key\" collection of the `JetTagCollection`. If this is not the case, the plugin will throw an exception at runtime.\r\n>\r\n>The limits of the current implementation of `HLTJetTag<T>` were discussed in #41045.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nNone beyond the checks done for #41351.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

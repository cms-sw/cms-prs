This would be useful to search for low mass monopoles that lead to large values of transverse thrust in the pixel detectors, as shown by ATLAS in recent searches of monopoles in ultra-peripheral collisions (UPC).\r\n\r\n@vince502 @mandrenguyen\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis filter was tested on a simulation of a (50 GeV mass) monopole formed in UPC with the SuperChic generator. Requiring a thrust > 0.8 (the average simulated monopole thrust is ~0.98), lead to 99.6% of the simulated events passing the filter.\r\nIt was also tested on zero bias data, where 99.7% of the events were rejected by the (thrust > 0.8) filter, thus helping to reduce the rate.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

Mainly, this allows us to check the L1 object efficiencies on-the-fly with the HLT Upgrade validation app currently under development (https://cmshltvalidation.app.cern.ch/), but it is foreseen to be later used to perform L1-HLT object matching also in the tau HLT paths. \r\nAs this is only a technical swap of the filter module, no impact on the path efficiencies is expected. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nBasic tests:\r\n- scram b runtests use-ibeos\r\n- runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos\r\n\r\nAlso tested on the validation server: https://cmshltvalidation.app.cern.ch/display/sharper/CMSSW_15_1_0_pre4_withL1SeedPR.20250811_084147?view=1&selectedPath=HLT_DoubleMediumChargedIsoPFTauHPS40_eta2p1&selectedFilter=hltL1P2GTTau", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1755170994", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["hlt-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 48738, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 9, "state": "open", "title": "New HLTFilter to read out L1P2GT tau candidates at Phase-2 HLT", "updated_at": "1755176934", "user": "agrubercms"}

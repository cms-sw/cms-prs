In order to avoid a crash that occurs because the number of final state particles is inconsistent with the user-set nFinal variable, a new nFinalMode has been created. The new nFinalMode causes a different check to be done on the number of final state particles.\r\n\r\nThe logic to set the variable ptHard does not correctly handle this special case, so an exception is called if the new nFinalMode is selected and pThardMode is not set to 0.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1538225589", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "generators-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-started"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_3_X", "number": 24763, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "update POWHEG EmissionVeto1 for WGamma special case", "updated_at": "1538352870", "user": "AndrewLevin"}

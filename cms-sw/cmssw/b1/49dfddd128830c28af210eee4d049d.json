A separate condFormat is defined for both sets of parameters and two helper classes are used to access the data within the SC code. Since the new records are not yet in the DB they are provided with an ESSource and ESProducer.\r\nData maker modules to generate sqlite files are included.\r\nThe initial parameters in this PR are the same as the ones currently in the master branch, introduced with #31823 , and so no changes are expected in the output.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n- All runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos tests passed\r\n- Perfect agreement between SCs reconstructed with CMSSW_11_2_0_pre7 with #31823 parameters and this code on top of CMSSW_11_2_0_pre7 (RelValH125GG sample, 2500 events).

We expect no dependency from this change, and will be only used to modify HLT trigger menus. The parameters for the classes are identical to 2023 configuration, updates on them will follow after this PR when we have tracking studies ready.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nHLT re-emulation was tested with the modified HIon trigger [menu ](https://cernbox.cern.ch/s/hvgNqhsURMSIZzP) in CMSSW_14_1_0_pre2 and CMSSW_14_1_0_pre3. The RAW sample generated from ```runTheMatrix.py -w upgrade -l 15550.402``` was used for test. No problem was found in CMSSW_14_1_0_pre3. \r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nI don't think backport is needed and can be only for releases moving forward.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nSoohwan\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 10, "comments": 1, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1717638154", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending", "heterogeneous-pending", "tracking", "trk"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 45151, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Include HIon type traits for Alpaka pixel tracking", "updated_at": "1717638184", "user": "vince502"}

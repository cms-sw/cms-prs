Original description\r\n\r\n> PromptReco for Heavy Ions was generating different RECO configurations for each job of the same Primary Dataset (and Run). This caused problems during merging as the ParameterSet registry grew, as reported in https://cms-talk.web.cern.ch/t/high-memory-usage-in-merge-alcareco-job-for-promptreco-run373536-zerobias17/29655.\r\n>\r\n> The difference between the RECO configurations was in how the DQM sequences were assigned to DQM Paths. One source for random shuffling was found to be in ConfigBuilder in case the expansion of the DQM sequence specifier leads to duplicate sequences.\r\n>\r\n> This PR fixes the path ordering, and adds a test for it.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe added unit test succeeds (and failed without the fix)\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

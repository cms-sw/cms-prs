It originally came about because at some stage the Stage 1 customisations were added to the `customisePostLS1_50ns` customisation function (see [SLHCUpgradeSimulations/Configuration/python/postLS1Customs.py#L9](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/CMSSW_8_0_X/SLHCUpgradeSimulations/Configuration/python/postLS1Customs.py#L9)), and the eras were just copied from them.\n\nI'm moderately sure all trigger configuration comes from the Global Tag now, so I don't think this will change anything in the comparisons.  It's better to get the code to reflect reality though so as not to confuse future maintainers.\n\nSubmitting this for 7_6_X - I'm assuming if merged it also automatically gets applied to 8_0_X.  If not let me know and I'll put in a separate PR.\n\n@mulhearn, @davidlange6 \n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1446202381", "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1445952164", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["comparison-available", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-rejected"], "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 12124, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Take Stage 1 trigger out of 50ns era", "updated_at": "1446202381", "user": "mark-grimes"}

This workaround was requested by Danilo Piparo.\nDanilo's explanation follows:\nOne of the ingredients needed to enable delayed  payload parsing is the forward declaration of classes, functions and typedefs. ROOT automatically produces them, transparently for the user.\nI found a case in CMS where this \"automatic forward declaration\" does not work.\nIt is in the TrackingTools/PatternTools package and I worked it around adding an entry to the selection file (src/classes_sel.xml):\n       class name=\"GlobalErrorBase&ltdouble,ErrorMatrixTag&gt\" /\n[More detail omitted for brevity]\nNow, I [Danilo] am _sure_ I can debug this with some time at disposal, say one morning, but unfortunately tomorrow I will leave for a 2 weeks vacation.\nI proposed to add the selection because it will make the cms jobs succeed and is relatively cheap to add.\n\nPlease merge this as soon as convenient.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_2_ROOT6_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1404929131", "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1404928917", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "87a989757bad90d24180912cbcf9ffae92c17039", "merged_at": "1404929131", "merged_by": "ktf", "number": 4590, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Workaround for ROOT 6 problem with forward declarations", "updated_at": "1404930735", "user": "wmtan"}

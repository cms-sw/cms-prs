This PR removes the duplication by moving these parameters up to PoolSource itself. In the secondary input source (EmbeddedRootSource), there is no such duplication, but the same data is also moved up to the source for consistency with PoolSource. This PR also does some C++11 modernization by adding missing override keywords and changing a few iterator loops to range based for loops.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 11, "closed_at": "1449118177", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1449067577", "deletions": 192, "labels": ["comparison-available", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "d68d375be50fe7c7eb726935d275b7c601f64a85", "merged_at": "1449118177", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 12643, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Remove duplicate data from PoolSource", "updated_at": "1454700074", "user": "wmtan"}

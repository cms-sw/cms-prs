The replacement is kept only to prevent numerical instability.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the code changes are minor changes.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nAs expected no change is observed in phase1 (as propToR is not used)\r\nhttp://uaf-10.t2.ucsd.edu/~legianni/plots_validateP2P_sl/plots_phase1/\r\n\r\nIn phase2 the propToR is used only in the hit search, but not the fit of the parameters (which also refitted using CKF), so the final effect is very small.\r\nhttp://uaf-10.t2.ucsd.edu/~legianni/plots_validateP2P_sl/plots_tt/\r\n\r\nA small increase in n. of hits in the muon sample at high pT (e.g. http://uaf-10.t2.ucsd.edu/~legianni/plots_validateP2P_sl/plots_3_mu_pt1to1000_eta0p0to0p4)\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 4, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1733801017", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved", "tracking"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_0_X", "number": 46906, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[mkFit] small fix in propToPlane", "updated_at": "1733834955", "user": "leonardogiannini"}

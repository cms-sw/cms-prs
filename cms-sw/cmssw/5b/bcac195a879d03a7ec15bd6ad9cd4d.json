The current implementation would, for specific module and template combinations, fill information in wrong qBin categories. The effect of this is small as it only affects RecHit position errors for certain modules.\r\n\r\nThis fix was part of [Irradiation Bias Correction at Alpaka PR](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/44569). I am splitting it in two because IBC needs further studies.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n`runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos` returns `47 46 45 36 19 1 1 1 1 1 1 tests passed, 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 failed`\r\n\r\nHLT timing comparison was made in 14_0_5 with the `/dev/CMSSW_14_0_0/GRun` configuration.

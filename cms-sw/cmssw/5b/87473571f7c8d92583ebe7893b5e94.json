Another parameter, \"fileLIstMode\" (boolean), can enable this behavior. Initialization order of services and modules is reorganized to allow setting run number from file names found by source.\n- option to disable reading back and merging output files at the end of lumisection (output module). In this case it is done by HLTD script when copying to BU output. This reduces used disk IO by 50% in HLT machines. (HLTD detects the change automatically.)\n- fix for a lumisection variable which was being re-initialized in a loop instead of before (source)\n- throw exception if \"stat\" returns -1, i.e. fails to find a file (source)\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": "1456997672", "comments": 9, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1456773293", "deletions": 104, "labels": ["comparison-available", "daq-approved", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "fe763ea197fecb044e30c019e0d9fdb5a689f096", "merged_at": "1456997672", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 13528, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Opening files from \"fileNames\" in DAQ input source and a different output merging mode", "updated_at": "1456997672", "user": "smorovic"}

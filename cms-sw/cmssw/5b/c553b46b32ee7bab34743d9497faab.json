This is already used in PUPPI MET computation, now added also to jets for consistency. The impact of this change is at less than % level to jet response, resolution, efficiency and purity.\r\n\r\nSummary at JME meeting and comparisons:\r\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/1188360/#4-puppi-tuning-neutral-pt-prot\r\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/1209020/#63-puppi-tuning-in-run3\r\n\r\nAim for CMSSW_12_6_0 \"Run3 Re-MiniAOD\".\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nscram b runtests\r\nrunTheMatrix - l 25.0\r\nNo differences observed on 10 events.\r\nExpect tiny difference to only show up in higher pt, like JetHT and QCD_flat samples.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

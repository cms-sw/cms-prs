This is needed because high precision tracking in field for low-energy particles is not needed in all CMS sub-detectors.\r\n\r\nIn the current variant of code this mechanism introduced but parameters are set to zero, so the simulation should produce unchanged results. New parameters of the method are configured by pythin and should be established after optimisation.\r\n\r\nAdditionally some clean-up is introduced:\r\n  - improved Info printouts;\r\n  - do not create field in master thread for ordinary runs - only in worker threads;\r\n  - reduced number of objects registered in tls;\r\n  - reduced number of mutable class members.\r\n ", "branch": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "changed_files": 17, "closed_at": "1484837004", "comments": 24, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1484556721", "deletions": 264, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "a2900e227e13605f9716aff1c3170d777b4de2b3", "merged_at": "1484837004", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "number": 17179, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "Smart G4 magnetic field manager", "updated_at": "1484837004", "user": "civanch"}

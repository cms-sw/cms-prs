It includes no change in the existing format, nor any usage of the new format in reconstruction code.\n\nReference: DT report at the DPG coordination meeting, Oct, 25:\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/346292/contribution/4/material/slides/0.pdf\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_3_X", "changed_files": 21, "closed_at": "1414658380", "comments": 12, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1414130692", "deletions": 53, "labels": ["alca-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "97450d3e258eb27305aae59d7acb14424cd8d21e", "merged_at": "1414658380", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_3_X", "number": 5977, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "New flexyble payloads for DT ttrig, vdrift and uncertainties", "updated_at": "1414658380", "user": "namapane"}

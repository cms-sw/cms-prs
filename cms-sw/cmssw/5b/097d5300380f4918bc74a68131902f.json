The crash was caused by a call to `SiPixelTemplate2D::interpolate` which had NaN track angles as inputs. The fix is just to check that the track angles are finite before proceeding with the interpolation. A similar change was applied to `SiPixelTemplate::interpolate` to avoid the potential for the same issue.\r\nNo changes are expected except for the extremely rare case when the input track angles are NaN's.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nIt compiles.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nThis is a backport of #34846 \r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1629327550", "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1629113650", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "db-approved", "orp-approved", "backport-ok"], "merge_commit_sha": "a10b610e2123b9fe2d5b006a782d1b79e734f470", "merged_at": "1629327550", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 34889, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 4, "state": "closed", "title": "[10_6_X] Fix rare crash in pixel template interpolation", "updated_at": "1629327551", "user": "mmusich"}

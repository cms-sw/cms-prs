In the original PR there were extraneous plots being produced and some spacing issues; this PR fixes those and updates compatibility to the current master.\r\n@laurenhay \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRan the PF validation and ensured that the new plots were being produced. Also did typical scram code checks and code format.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 11, "closed_at": "1701206259", "comments": 14, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1700153957", "deletions": 62, "labels": ["dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved", "pf"], "merge_commit_sha": "6b19bb3a4c219a39d8cb22674b60c9849d9cbeaf", "merged_at": "1701206259", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "number": 43304, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 5, "state": "closed", "title": "UPDATED: Adding of jet purity and efficiency plots to PFValidation package", "updated_at": "1701206259", "user": "peteryouBuffalo"}

The reason was due to the input HCAL RecHit number being used to specify the work division for kernels, and it was not protected against a case of requesting 0 blocks when there are no RecHits.\r\n\r\nIncluded now are checks on the number of rechits and the SoA size to only launch the Alpaka kernels if they are non-zero.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nIn `14_1_0_pre2`, tested on matrix workflows `12434.422, 12434.424`. The missing HCAL validation for HLT is done in the backport.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 2, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1712754566", "deletions": 48, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 44693, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Fix crash in PF Clustering due to empty HCAL RecHits collection", "updated_at": "1712755171", "user": "jsamudio"}

All the function does is call (indirectly) EDConsumerBase::labelsForToken().\nThe new functionality is needed for the consumes interface.  In cases where getByToken() will be called from a helper function, there is currently no convenient way to get the module label, product instance name and process name for error messages if the getByToken() fails, or for that matter, for informational messages if it succeeds.\nPlease expedite testing this pull request, because much further development of the consumes interface depends on it.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": "1426067231", "comments": 16, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1426012768", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["comparison-available", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "9907ca8af879187f80cbd8034bba195929e9d17c", "merged_at": "1426067231", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 8183, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add labelsFromToken function to event/lumi/run", "updated_at": "1426166046", "user": "wmtan"}

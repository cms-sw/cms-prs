User has to explicitly decide when choosing either `--era Run2_25ns` or `--era Run2_50ns` (can also choose `Run2_HI` but that's not relevant to this PR).\n\nIn principle this should be the last PR to replace the `customisePostLS1` customisation, barring fixes for bugs found during validation.  Validation will be presented in the 26/Feb/2015 reco meeting.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1424978622", "comments": 16, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1424783955", "deletions": 78, "labels": ["comparison-available", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "e9c2a7ed9ab9e464d468fe77e8d368736c6b71c0", "merged_at": "1424978622", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 7926, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Change bunchspacing eras to the newer versions", "updated_at": "1425030429", "user": "mark-grimes"}

To achieve this goal the following changes were introduced:\r\n* BoostedTauSeedProducer was templated to enable miniAOD inputs,\r\n* Tool to adapt tau sequences was modified (functions grouped into class, possibility to use postfix added, boosted tau pair reco enabled, some cleaning).\r\n\r\nThese changes do not modifies standard workflows.\r\n\r\nNote: boosted tau pair reco with miniAOD inputs compared to its counterpart with AOD inputs shows similar differences as observed for standard tau reco.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nA MiniAOD production workflow and a custom tau-reco-at-mini one successfully tested.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1628752093", "comments": 26, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1626877447", "deletions": 263, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-rejected", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "0bfad9d34a81ecebfb00d6b5d5a93064d32e3d5b", "merged_at": "1628752093", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "number": 34576, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 7, "state": "closed", "title": "Enable boosted tau reco to run at miniAOD", "updated_at": "1628752094", "user": "mbluj"}

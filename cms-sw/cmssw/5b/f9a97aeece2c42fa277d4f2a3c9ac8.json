We need this change to perform measurements of beam pipe position in detector. \nWe have simulated beam pipe with mc_run2 configuration and with new 1.8 cm cut and could reconstruct it in MC (picture is attached).\n\nBest regards, Anna\n\n![beampipeforrunii](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5188748/7986959/00547122-0adb-11e5-84ea-24608f8ed6de.png)\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1433600551", "comments": 25, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1433422798", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-rejected"], "merge_commit_sha": "6b41c4fac3c6744ca8468e40124b2ef661bfaf17", "merged_at": "1433600551", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 9454, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "change primaryVertexCut for displaced Vertex reconstruction from 2.5 ", "updated_at": "1433848726", "user": "kropiv"}

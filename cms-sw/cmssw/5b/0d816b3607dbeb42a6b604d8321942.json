Please see for a presentation on its development:\r\n\r\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/594656/contributions/2403265/attachments/1390281/2117550/nmccoll_12_16_16_ME0Newsigis.pdf#search=Mc%20Coll\r\n\r\nWhile it is useful for granularity/neutron/# of layer studies, I added in a feature to simply use the granularity as defined by the geometry. This allows for the digitization, and merging, of hits as expected for the ME0 granularity. It also adds a new collection, which is simply a map of integers...pointing from input digi index to new digi index. Since we filter and merge inputs, it is a many to one map with empty entries.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_9_1_X", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1490743830", "comments": 1, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1490743806", "deletions": 278, "labels": [], "number": 18112, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "ME0 pseudo digitizer update", "updated_at": "1490743831", "user": "nickmccoll"}

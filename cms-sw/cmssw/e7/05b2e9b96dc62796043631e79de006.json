The crash was caused by a call to `SiPixelTemplate2D::interpolate` which had NaN track angles as inputs. The fix is just to check that the track angles are finite before proceeding with the interpolation. A similar change was applied to `SiPixelTemplate::interpolate` to avoid the potential  for the same issue. \r\n\r\nNo changes are expected except for the extremely rare case when the input track angles are NaN's.

The LogDebug statement could access the object pointed to by results when results is not filled. This potentially could cause a seg fault. Issue #42470 reports a seg fault in that part of the code. This bug might or might not be the cause of that seg fault. I did not verify the connection, but the bug should be fixed irregardless. We can monitor the IBs after this PR is merged to see if that failure stops occurring.\r\n\r\nThis also modifies the module to only call consumes and construct the results object corresponding to the chosen option, a minor optimization.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRelies on existing tests.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 10, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1713979481", "deletions": 12, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "bug-fix", "upgrade-approved", "code-checks-approved", "hgcal"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 44843, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Fix bug in TICLLayerTileProducer.", "updated_at": "1714035632", "user": "wddgit"}

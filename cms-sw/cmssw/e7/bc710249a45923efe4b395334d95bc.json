Such cuts were missing in the original SiStrip version. The histograms are now closer to the old SiPixel residuals histograms.\n- The source code now compiles into two modules to keep the configrations of SiPixel and SiStrip independent. \n- Some other cleanup.\n\nThese changes affect the configuration options for the TrackMonitorTrack module. I updated the config files as far as I could follow; however, the new SiPixelMonitorTrackResiduals might be added in more places. Also, some files use options that were probably broken before, i did not touch these.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 11, "closed_at": "1458027820", "comments": 50, "commits": 13, "created_at": "1455801824", "deletions": 176, "labels": ["alca-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "464cd359bcfc3f0e300691b4656c1d00d5953358", "merged_at": "1458027820", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 13393, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 10, "state": "closed", "title": "DQM TrackerMonitorTrack improvements", "updated_at": "1458027820", "user": "schneiml"}

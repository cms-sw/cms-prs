On the other hand, a new python script startSkim.py was created to use alternatively to skimProducer.bash. This new script enables parallel execution of skims as well as automatic renaming of the output files (from *00N.root to *_(N+1).root which is the input name format needed for the APE measurements) and moving of the skimmed files to a target directory.\r\n\r\ne43f208 adds additional optional input parameters to the central _cfg.py files used for a measurement. When using the standard workflow, these parameters are unused and nothing changes. However, the commit also includes a new folder autoSubmitter which includes a script to configure and submit multiple measurements at the same time in order to be able to do multiple measurements at once using only one CMSSW-environment.", "branch": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "changed_files": 12, "closed_at": "1536676134", "comments": 15, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1533708572", "deletions": 179, "labels": ["alca-approved", "backport-ok", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "43b5dc26ee4ca7d4be3b8b7aa9ab611c10a6cd63", "merged_at": "1536676134", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 24233, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Ape parallel features: Backport of #24192", "updated_at": "1536676134", "user": "mteroerd"}

I am not deleting crabWrapper and associated functionality from `validateAlignments.py` yet in case this conflicts with the condor migration, but if it doesn't, as far as I'm concerned someone can go ahead and delete it.\r\n\r\n@adewit @connorpa @mmusich \r\n\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1559671841", "comments": 16, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1559142625", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "d9313af521e3e933b7616089ec91f26cee05b9cf", "merged_at": "1559671841", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 26999, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "TkAl All in One tool: don't import crabWrapper", "updated_at": "1559671842", "user": "hroskes"}

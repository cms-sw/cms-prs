Prototype of a number of methods of Phase2TrackerDigitizerAlgorithm have changed. Code duplication removed. Integration of new algorithms, if any, will be more straight-forward now.  \r\n- Phase2TrackerDigitizer configuration updated to have a common PSet for Pixel. Individual IT-pixel algorithms clone it with necessary modifications \r\n- A bug fix has been made in the dual slope correction to avoid a shift of 0.5 ToT bin \r\n- A logical bug was fixed in Phase2TrackerDigitizerAlgorithm::primary_ionization(...)\r\n\r\n\r\n- what changes are expected in the output if any  -->  none\r\n- what other PRs or externals it depends upon if any --> none\r\n- link to any additional material useful to provide a documentation for this PR (slides, JIRA tickets, related pull requestes, hypernews, TWiki or Indico pages)  --> https://indico.cern.ch/event/879046/contributions/3931489/attachments/2068895/3472721/SWDesignUpdate_validation_03072020.pdf\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nscram b runtests\r\nrunTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\nNot applicable\r\n\r\n\r\n@subirsarkar @emiglior @skinnari @duartej  @OzAmram ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 14, "closed_at": "1595398434", "comments": 33, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1594138462", "deletions": 452, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "b01abde0b2511f0746231a49374d8826474a8ae2", "merged_at": "1595398434", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 30582, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 7, "state": "closed", "title": "Software Design Update for the Phase2 Tracker Digitizer", "updated_at": "1595398434", "user": "suchandradutta"}

It is correcting two issues:\r\n\r\n- by default no_TOT = -1 so it should be filtered out by condition TOT!=-1 or, as recommended by expert, TOT>0\r\n- x coordinate has to take into account number of windows, the shift was hardcoded to 0.25 which is only correct for windowsNum=4\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nstandard tests\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

This object is treated separately from the regular Muon object. Much of it is based on the muon code, but fortunately it's much simpler.\r\n* The code is based on UTM lib 0.9.X (https://gitlab.cern.ch/cms-l1t-utm/utm/-/releases/utm_0.9.0), which was recently integrated into CMSSW_12_0_X and CMSSW_12_1_X\r\n   * cms-sw/cmsdist#7337 \r\n   * cms-sw/cmsdist#7281 \r\n* The uGT for Run-3 will have 4 bits per BX for muon showers: MUS0, MUS1, MUSOOT0 and MUSOOT1. They map to UTM bits MuonShower0, MuonShower1, MuonShowerOutOfTime0 and MuonShowerOutOfTime1\r\n* For startup Run-3 we foresee MuonShower0 and MuonShower1 to be used by L1 trigger seeds. The other two bits can be used for enhanced shower triggers.\r\n* Previous PRs include \r\n   * #35886\r\n   * #34178\r\n   * #33569\r\n   * #33446\r\n   * #33444\r\n   * #33416\r\n   * #33389\r\n* Related PRs include:\r\n   * https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/35627 \r\n   * https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/34801\r\n   * https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/35461\r\n   * https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/35836 \r\n* A few relevant presentations can be found here: \r\n    * [HadronicShowerTrigger_EXO_LL_L1DPG_6May2021.pdf](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1032087/contributions/4334392/attachments/2239866/3798910/HadronicShowerTrigger_EXO_LL_L1DPG_6May2021.pdf)\r\n    * [HLT_muon_shower_martin.pdf](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1032087/contributions/4334095/attachments/2241349/3800447/HLT_muon_shower_martin.pdf)\r\n   * [MuonShower_Oct1_Martin.pdf](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1080450/contributions/4548741/attachments/2320995/3952292/MuonShower_Oct1_Martin.pdf)\r\n * Related JIRA ticket to include new L1 seeds for Run-3:\r\n    * https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSLITDPG-953  \r\n* The design, implementation and performance of the hadronic shower trigger is documented here: https://gitlab.cern.ch/tdr/notes/DN-20-033/blob/master/temp/DN-20-033_temp.pdf\r\n * Integrating this PR is not urgent, but since it's quite a bit of code, it would be good to get early feedback from CMSSW managers.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n* Code compiles. \r\n* A few integration tests have already been done with Run-3 GEN-SIM-RAW signal samples, such as \r\n`/HTo2LongLivedTo4b_MH-1000_MFF-450_CTau-100000mm_TuneCP5_14TeV_pythia8/Run3Winter20DRPremixMiniAOD-110X_mcRun3_2021_realistic_v6-v2/GEN-SIM-RAW`\r\n* Rate studies are being carried out with this branch https://github.com/cms-l1t-offline/cmssw/pull/951 and with official L1 menu tools:\r\n   * https://github.com/cms-l1-dpg/L1MenuTools/pull/62 \r\n   * https://github.com/cms-l1-dpg/L1MenuTools/pull/66\r\n\r\nThere should be no changes in any workflow since the showers are not enabled in the global trigger logic.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nN/A", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 38, "comments": 73, "commits": 10, "created_at": "1636159159", "deletions": 39, "labels": ["l1-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "requires-external", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_2_X", "number": 36018, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "uGT framework and L1 ntuples for showers in the muon system for Run-3 (HadronicShowerTrigger-8)", "updated_at": "1638564367", "user": "dildick"}

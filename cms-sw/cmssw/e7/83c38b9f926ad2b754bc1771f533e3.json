I have consolidated the RecoPFJets_cff customizations into separate cfi python files in RecoJets/JetProducers. \r\n\r\n- Removed iterative cone, SIScone, and AK5 PF and Calo jets in all configurations. \r\n- Consolidated the various grooming schemes into a single file per jet radius (so, AK4 puppi is now in ak4PFJets_cfi, for instance).\r\n- Left AK4, AK8, KT4, KT6, and only AK5/7 Castor collections since those are the only ones used anywhere in the repository. \r\n- Added an example AK8 GenJet configuration with grooming applied, since this is a common question. It is not presently run anywhere, though. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDIT: No changes should occur to any output, this is a reorganization.

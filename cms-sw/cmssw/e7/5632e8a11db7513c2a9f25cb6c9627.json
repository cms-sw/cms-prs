Here I didn't extend it since our neutral signal particle 3000022 is covered by the current upper limit 4000000. But I'll let @civanch comment more.\r\n\r\nThis PR should be ported to all releases since CMSSW_8_1_X because that's when PR #16366 starts to add the tracking of long lived exotic particles (from my understanding what they really wanted in PR #16366 is to track 'charged' exotic particles, but they didn't specify charge!=0 back then and that caused an issue for our dark photon 3000022). We also need this PR #27732 for 2017 and 2018 central MC sample production.

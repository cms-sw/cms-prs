This is done via an arbitrary function in arbitrary bins. While we know what function we want to apply, it has been designed to easily change this function in the future while maintaining the exact same python interface (ie old configs still work the same, no confdb reparse needed). Hence the rather abstract interface. Given this is a stream module, my understanding from replies on the fwcore hypernews that a TF1 / TF2 / TF3 is acceptable here. If its not, we can hard code the functions easily enough.\n\nMartin, does this need to be backported to 80X as well for the HLT? \n\nCheers,\nSam\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1459317284", "comments": 13, "commits": 9, "created_at": "1459058664", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "hlt-approved", "orp-pending", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "9e5e873ad53136683121a141d95ed83649b9aab1", "merged_at": "1459317284", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 13846, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "E/g HLT Pixel Match Variable Producer", "updated_at": "1459854349", "user": "Sam-Harper"}

In the base class CaloSD Geant4 interface ProcessHits(..) is implemented. In the \r\n        derived classes two main methods for sub-detectors : getFromLibrary(..) and \r\n        getEnergyDeposit(.. ) allow implementation of shower libraries/parametrisation \r\n        or detailed simulation \r\n2.     Removed duplicated codes from sub-detector classes and use base class CaloSD methods \r\n3.     use const G4Step* pointer in protected and private interfaces, use const pointers and \r\n        references for all other objects, where possible\r\n4.     use std::unique_ptr, auto, and other C++11 features where possible\r\n5.     reduce number of protected class members and reduced number of type conversions\r\n6.     optimized ECalSD run time methods - perform only one search over map of logical \r\n        volumes instead of doing this in each method\r\n7.     remove usage of G4ParticleTable at initialisation use instead static utility\r\n8.     optimised LogInfo and LogDebug - verbose output is substantially smaller but keeping\r\n        similar information\r\n9.     removed old commented lines\r\n10.   applied corrections suggested by @kpedro88 and @VinInn to previous PRs\r\n\r\nCorrectness of this PR means identical results for all WFs.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 46, "closed_at": "1527686091", "comments": 66, "commits": 11, "created_at": "1526546385", "deletions": 2585, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "6f1d13b8a1f1699580e9523a75b5cb22cbefa4c8", "merged_at": "1527686091", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 23226, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Geant4 sensitive detectors revision 5 ", "updated_at": "1527686091", "user": "civanch"}

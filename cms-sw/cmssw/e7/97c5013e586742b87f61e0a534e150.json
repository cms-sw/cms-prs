In the base class CaloSD Geant4 interface ProcessHits(..) is implemented. In the derived classes two main methods for sub-detectors : getFromLibrary(..) and getEnergyDeposit(.. ) allows implementation of shower libraries/parametrisation or detailed simulation \r\n2.     Removed duplicated codes from sub-detector classes and use base class CaloSD methods \r\n3.     use const G4Step* pointer in protected and private interfaces, use const pointers and references for all other objects, where possible \r\n4.     use std::unique_ptr, auto, and other C++11 features where possible\r\n5.     reduce number of protected class members and reduced number of type conversions\r\n6.     optimized ECalSD run time methods - perform only one search over map of logical volumes instead of doing this in each method\r\n7.     remove usage of G4ParticleTable at initialisation use instead static utility\r\n8.     optimised LogInfo and LogDebug - verbose output is substantially smaller but keep similar information\r\n9.     removed old commented lines\r\n10.   applied corrections suggested by @kpedro88 and @VinInn to previous PRs\r\n\r\nCorrectness of this PR means identical results for all WFs.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 46, "comments": 3, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1526546385", "deletions": 2534, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending", "upgrade-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 23226, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Geant4 sensitive detectors revision 5 ", "updated_at": "1526546822", "user": "civanch"}

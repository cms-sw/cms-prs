This  should  be the safest way, as I can't run the matrix tests due to not being able to access the necessary files right now...\r\n\r\n__Note:__ needs to be tested with workflows 136.7801, 136.7803, 1040.0 explicitly, as these are the ones that were crashing and they are not covered by the limited matrix tests performed by the bot.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n```\r\npython  DQMOffline/Trigger/python/EgammaMonitoring_cff.py\r\n```", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1560839311", "comments": 27, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1560754870", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "251514f27d7436aa59c6568faefdd8317c248b02", "merged_at": "1560839311", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27221, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Bugfix after \"Adapting MVAVariableHelper to new E/gamma UL format and removal of MultiToken\"", "updated_at": "1560839311", "user": "guitargeek"}

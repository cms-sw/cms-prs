The code was\nrelaying on `#define private public` to get these class working\ntogether.\n\nCompiles fine and test is working.\n\nSigned-off-by: David Abdurachmanov David.Abdurachmanov@cern.ch\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1444056710", "comments": 10, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1443697497", "deletions": 83, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "ea61124e26db9d285310553423b59412b9b87cf2", "merged_at": "1444056710", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 11590, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "DataFormats/TrackReco: remove intrusive macros breaking stdlibc++", "updated_at": "1444056711", "user": "davidlt"}

In some cases, the former modifications were set as the default or as part of the base `phase2_hgcal` modifier; in other cases (e.g. tuning/calibrations), the modifications were moved into the `phase2_hgcalV10` modifier.\r\n\r\nIf HGCal experts (@cseez @rovere @bsunanda @jbsauvan) would prefer different choices in some of these cases, please comment on this PR.\r\n\r\nThis PR only addresses configuration files (and associated `fillDescriptions()`). Significant parts of the C++ code could be cleaned up further, but this is left to the existing issue #27095.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRan workflow 23234.0 successfully.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 38, "closed_at": "1595341823", "comments": 19, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1594816454", "deletions": 389, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "geometry-approved", "l1-pending", "operations-approved", "orp-approved", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "116b14c07cf2ef8ea03f6626890ec12758d352a3", "merged_at": "1595341823", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 30702, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "remove phase2_hgcalV9 modifier", "updated_at": "1595341824", "user": "kpedro88"}

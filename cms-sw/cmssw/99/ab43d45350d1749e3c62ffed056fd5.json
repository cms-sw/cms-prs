Hence, it makes a lot of sense\nto use lazy-download for this case.  _However_, it may not be\ndesirable to enable lazy-download for all workflows!  Nor may it\nbe desirable for the workflow layers to enable lazy-download for\nall merges (as some sites don't have the disk space).\n\nThis patch allows us to selectively turn on lazy-download only for\nmerge jobs at a given site by editing site-local-config.xml.\n\nPer request from Dirk, this pull request is against 7_2_X.  It's fairly self-contained and I can back/forward port as necessary.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_2_X", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": "1416315362", "comments": 28, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1413989856", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["comparison-available", "core-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_2_X", "number": 5943, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 14, "state": "closed", "title": "Provide the ability to do a separate cache-hint for cloning.", "updated_at": "1416315362", "user": "bbockelm"}

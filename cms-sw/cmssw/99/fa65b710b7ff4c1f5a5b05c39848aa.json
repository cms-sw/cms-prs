Added soft-dropped subjets from gen jets. \r\n\r\nThis is for nanoAOD to be fully usable for substructure analyses. The CPU time added is negligible (<1 ms/event) because I am not computing the areas for the gen jets (not needed). I also preclustered them with AK8. There is expected to be a small increase in size.\r\n\r\nThe preclustering required more code than I intended, since, to first order, this is merely a configuration change. However many dictionaries were missing to do the preclustering on GenJets, and the VirtualJetProducer could not understand the ```vector<FwdPtr<GenParticle>>```.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Adding 2 AK8 jets with lower pt for SMP-J measurements. We now have:\r\n\r\n- all AK8 PF jets with pt > 100 GeV with b-tagging information, (New: lower pt threshold)\r\n   - if pt > 170 GeV, add grooming, tau1-tau4, and N2 (add tau4)\r\n   - if pt > 250 GeV, add N3 (unchanged in this PR)\r\n- 3 AK8 jets with pt > 30 with only b-tagging information, no grooming nor substructure. (New)\r\n- all AK8 Gen jets with pt > 120 GeV with grooming (As in 1 from this PR). \r\n- 3 AK8 Gen jets with pt > 10 with no grooming nor substructure (New). \r\n\r\n\r\nThis is expected to add 3 AK8 jets and 3 AK8 genjets per event. \r\n\r\n\r\n@arizzi, @gpetruc, @clelange also watching.

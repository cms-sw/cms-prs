S-Link, Capture block, and ECON-D provide independent counters of event id, orbit and bunch. Although out-of-synchs between them will be flagged, it would be good to quantify by how much the counters are off with respect to each other if it happens. In this PR, we modified to DataFormats/HGCalDigi/interface/HGCalECONDPacketInfoSoA.h and DataFormats/HGCalDigi/interface/HGCalFEDPacketInfoSoA.h to store the counters read from ECON-D, Capture Block and S-Link header in EventFilter/HGCalRawToDigi/src/HGCalUnpacker.cc. The EventFilter/HGCalRawToDigi/plugins/HGCalRawToDigi.cc is also updated accordingly. A bug in DataFormats/HGCalDigi/interface/HGCalRawDataDefinitions.h is also fixed so we are using correct mask now. Debug output in HGCalUnpacker is wrapped in `#ifdef EDM_ML_DEBUG`\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nWe have run the code with our routine procedure and printed out the numbers, no bug found and the numbers agree\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

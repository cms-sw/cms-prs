It is needed as preparation for 2024 data-taking with an updated algorithm that enables triggering with non-pointing muons, and to decouple Phase1 (current) and Phase2 emulators.\r\n\r\nNote: this PR does not switch on algorithm changes expected for 2024, but only prepares code for it. This will be done with other PR when new algorithm in firmware is fully validated. It will additional require an upload of new patters to DB and updated GT or (temporary) new xml files in cms-data. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nSuccessfully passed matrix tests (limited)\r\n\r\nFYI, @akalinow, @kbunkow \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 69, "comments": 20, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1704872876", "deletions": 898, "labels": ["l1-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "requires-external", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 43687, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 36, "state": "open", "title": "Refactoring of Phase1 OMTF emulator code", "updated_at": "1708938191", "user": "mbluj"}

The delayed jet skim is for use in analyses using jet timing, such as EXO-19-001 (which requires collections only available at AOD). The DT cluster skim is for use in analyses using muon clusters, such as EXO-21-008. The DT cluster skim saves the following collections in addition to AOD:\r\nDTLayerIdDTRecHit1DPairsOwnedRangeMap_dt1DRecHits__RECO\r\nCSCDetIdCSCRecHit2DsOwnedRangeMap_csc2DRecHits__RECO\r\n\r\nThe delayed jet skim cuts on all tracks satisfying the associated HLT paths under \"HLT_HT430_DelayedJet40*\":\r\nHLT_HT430_DelayedJet40_SingleDelay2nsInclusive_v1\r\nHLT_HT430_DelayedJet40_DoubleDelay1nsInclusive_v1\r\nHLT_HT430_DelayedJet40_SingleDelay1nsTrackless_v1\r\nHLT_HT430_DelayedJet40_DoubleDelay0p5nsTrackless_v1\r\n\r\nThe DT cluster skim also cuts on tracks satisfying its associated HLT paths under \"*DTCluster*\":\r\nHLT_L1MET_DTClusterNoMB1S50_v1\r\nHLT_CaloMET60_DTClusterNoMB1S50_v1\r\nHLT_L1MET_DTCluster50_v1\r\nHLT_CaloMET60_DTCluster50_v1\r\n\r\nTested with a high-Pt QCD sample /store/relval/CMSSW_12_3_0_pre6/RelValQCD_Pt_1800_2400_14/GEN-SIM-RECO/123X_mcRun3_2021_realistic_v11-v2/10000/aa515779-dad9-4994-b7d2-d672a7c8938a.root (2500 events), the skimmed file size for DT clusters was 6.2MB, the skimmed file size for delayed jets was 4.9MB, and the size of the unskimmed AOD file in each case was 551MB.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRan with CMSSW_12_4_0_pre1 and used the config files \"test_DTCluster_cfg.py\" and \"test_DelayedJet_cfg.py\", which are both included in the PR.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1650066555", "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1649459496", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["fully-signed", "tests-approved", "pdmv-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "bacc2379de0eb79755cf615a997af1f8b5a2e727", "merged_at": "1650066555", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 37509, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Skim for Delayed Jets and DTClusters", "updated_at": "1650066555", "user": "rtschmitz"}

While there is no specific reason to do this now, `getTH1` is unsafe in general and will become illegal at some point (for certain situations, at least).\r\n\r\nFor now, this is just general cleanup of the DQM codebase.\r\n\r\nSome new APIs in the `MonitorElement` are required for this, since those are present in #28092, it is included here. This PR should wait until #28092 is merged.\r\n\r\nI excluded the changes regarding `SetCanExtend`, since I am not really sure if and where it is safe to remove these calls. This will need to be figured out later.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nNo changes expected.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 44, "closed_at": "1574239966", "comments": 42, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1572865272", "deletions": 317, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "hlt-approved", "l1-pending", "orp-approved", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "e560da8dc729cc5d8249714c335d1b3aec82d228", "merged_at": "1574239966", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 28342, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "DQM: Reduce TH1 Usage", "updated_at": "1574239967", "user": "schneiml"}

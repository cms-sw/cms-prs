To run a real test is required to make a repository to store the BDT xml file (now residing under RecoMTD/TimingIDTools/data). Please create a cms-data repository for this package.\r\n\r\n@parbol @hatakeyamak @bendavid @simonepigazzini", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 16, "closed_at": "1581533681", "comments": 102, "commits": 28, "created_at": "1580236809", "deletions": 184, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "requires-external", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved", "urgent"], "merge_commit_sha": "345341148fd7b6b62f3586928436ee80f9816102", "merged_at": "1581533681", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 28815, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 44, "state": "closed", "title": "MTD TDR Reconstruction + MTD Track Association BDT ", "updated_at": "1582052237", "user": "pmeridian"}

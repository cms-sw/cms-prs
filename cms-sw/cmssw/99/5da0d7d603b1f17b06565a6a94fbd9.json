By switching\nto returning a std::unique_ptr<Bounds> by value, the static analyzer\nno longer complains and it makes callers of the routine take explicit\nownership of the pointer (which they should have done all along).\nThere were only minor changes to other code to deal with this change.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1394719904", "comments": 4, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1394653498", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "7ff4f270f017f46a6286ef39b6b835c616e80aa9", "merged_at": "1394719904", "merged_by": "nclopezo", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_1_0_pre5", "number": 2831, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Have GeometricDet::bounds() return std::unique_ptr<Bounds>", "updated_at": "1395085095", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

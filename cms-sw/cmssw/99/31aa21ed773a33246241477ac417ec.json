This was extended to include the list of process names in process order. This is needed to fully interpret the ProductRegistry content.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nFramework unit tests pass\r\n\r\nresolves https://github.com/cms-sw/framework-team/issues/1518\r\nresolves https://github.com/cms-sw/framework-team/issues/1519", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 36, "comments": 10, "commits": 9, "created_at": "1755525595", "deletions": 41, "labels": ["core-pending", "daq-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-rejected", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "changes-dataformats"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 48757, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 4, "state": "open", "title": "Require that process order be consistent when merging files", "updated_at": "1755602625", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

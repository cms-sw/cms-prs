A run-time check on the column sizes being the same is performed. \r\nAdditionally, a new `aggregate` method has been added to `PortableHostCollection` taking as input a `SoAView` and creating a unique memory buffer to save its columns contiguously. This is useful to create a PortableCollection from the VIew built with the newly implemented constructor. \r\nUnit tests for both these features have been added as well.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nUnit tests created pass.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 11, "comments": 17, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1739179466", "deletions": 34, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "heterogeneous-pending", "ngt"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 47306, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 12, "state": "open", "title": "New constructor for the SoAView and aggregate method for Collections", "updated_at": "1740565747", "user": "leobeltra"}

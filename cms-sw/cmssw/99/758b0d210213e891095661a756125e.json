This includes removing the usage of isnan, including esConsume statements for thread safety warnings and fixing some potential memory leaks. \r\n\r\nCurrently, there is still one warning about a potential memory leak left that I think might just be the compiler not understanding the code correctly. The warning is:\r\n\r\n/afs/cern.ch/work/m/mteroerd/Alignment/CMSSW_11_2_0_pre9/src/Alignment/APEEstimation/plugins/ApeEstimatorSummary.cc:1071:5: warning: Potential memory leak\r\n    defaultTreeX->Fill();\r\n\r\nMarco suggested that I create a PR to see if experts know more about this.

It has been non-existent for more than four years, but there are still config files that use it even after I removed many obsolete config files in two previous pull requests.\nThis PR removes the remaining config files that use this fragment, because none of these files could have ever worked in CMSSW_4_0_0 or later.\nI am doing this because I am working on a feature that needs to modify a lot of config files, and I don't want to waste time looking at long obsolete config files.\nThis removes another 5000 lines of code that has been non-functional for years.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 46, "closed_at": "1437202120", "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1437073075", "deletions": 5121, "labels": ["alca-pending", "comparison-pending", "dqm-approved", "fastsim-approved", "generators-pending", "geometry-pending", "l1-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "tests-rejected"], "merge_commit_sha": "070c3b8b56430ee605c315b26d011a7362063d74", "merged_at": "1437202120", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 10246, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Remove files that use non-existent config fragment MixingNoPileUp_cff", "updated_at": "1437228754", "user": "wmtan"}

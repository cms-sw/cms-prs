To fully explore its potential electromagnetic part of configuration of EM physics should be changed. Proposed update will work only if FTFP_BERT_EMH Geant4 Physics List is used, so no change in results is expected. \r\n\r\nEnabling of G4HepEM should provide a significant CPU benefit for FullSim both for Run-3 and Phase-2. This will be be proposed later after seria of validations.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nprivate \r\n\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

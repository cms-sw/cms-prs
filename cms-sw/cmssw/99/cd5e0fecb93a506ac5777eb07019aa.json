This\nis a thread-safety issue since a routine that has a 'const' CosmicMuonSmoother\ncan still change the memory owned by the smoother. The fix was trivial since\nno other code cared that those pointers were non-const.\nThe two TrajectoryBuilder classes were passing on one of the non-const\npointers so they also had to be changed to return a const pointer.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1396334756", "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1396263088", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "45c146d8b0a64d40ff9aacf9100dd3ff5667050a", "merged_at": "1396334756", "merged_by": "nclopezo", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_1_0_pre6", "number": 3109, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fixed const correctness for CosmicMuonSmoother", "updated_at": "1405069590", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

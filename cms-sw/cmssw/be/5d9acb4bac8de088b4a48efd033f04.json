We've observed that this can lead to the EventTree TTreeCache prefetching the entire EventAuxiliary branch, reading records scattered throughout the entire file.  This PR skips all duplicate checker initialization if checking is disabled.  DuplicateChecker::inputFileOpened() is a no-op if duplicate checking is disabled, so this change should be safe.

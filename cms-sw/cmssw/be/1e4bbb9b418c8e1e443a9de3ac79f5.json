The improvement is in the EMTF emulator memory consumption (by ~75%) and time performance (~50%).  The l1t emulation is bitwise identical before and after these changes, as expected. \n\nThis is the version of the L1T  software intended for MC production. \n- It is identical to the l1t-integration-v85.1 tag of the L1T Software.  Included features of the tags up to this latest one are tracked on the [twiki](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/SWGuideL1TOfflineDev#Status_of_Integration)\n\nSome remarks:\n- Fixes in high pT muons in EMTF and the use of 2nd earliest arriving LCT are included.\n- BMTF emulator uses RPCs although not present in data.  The firmware will be changed soon to use the RPCs as well. \n- Old calorimeter calibration constants are used. The derivation of the new ones is still ongoing, and \n  is not to be used in the MC production.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 248, "closed_at": "1475220592", "comments": 20, "commits": 242, "created_at": "1472667789", "deletions": 12361, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "l1-pending", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-rejected"], "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 15689, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Pr80x l1t-tsg-v9 for Sept 2016 MC production ", "updated_at": "1475220593", "user": "rekovic"}

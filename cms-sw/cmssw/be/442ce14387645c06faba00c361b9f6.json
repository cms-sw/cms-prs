This mismatch in conditions used for the two producers is fixed with this PR.\r\nThe RecHit producer needs to use the conditions matching the reconstruction algorithm running in the uncalibrated REcHit producer.\r\n\r\nIn the online DQM the ratio timing is used and the record labels are explicitly set to be empty.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nPasses the limited matrix tests.\r\n\r\nBackport of #43795 ", "branch": "CMSSW_13_3_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1707316951", "comments": 17, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1706281247", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["dqm-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "bug-fix", "orp-approved", "backport-ok", "ecal"], "merge_commit_sha": "c19ea12335c409990235e8525a78140b491e87c3", "merged_at": "1707316951", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_13_3_X", "number": 43800, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "ECAL - Set correct CC tag labels for ECAL RecHit producer - 133x", "updated_at": "1707316952", "user": "thomreis"}

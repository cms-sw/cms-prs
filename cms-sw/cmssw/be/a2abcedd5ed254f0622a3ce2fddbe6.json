This PR changes all put calls in L1 to use std::unique_ptr instead of std::auto_ptr. Some other instances of std::auto_ptr in L1 may also have been changed to std::unique_ptr. Some (but not all) cases where auto_ptr was passed by reference (a bad practice) and ownership was not transferred were changed to pass a bare pointer instead to make it clear that ownership was not transferred.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 119, "closed_at": "1464070050", "comments": 14, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1462585129", "deletions": 873, "labels": ["comparison-available", "l1-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "3284f1231e1fb466c365bbacbbb8e0d718b12db8", "merged_at": "1464070050", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 14403, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Use unique_ptr, not auto_ptr, in L1", "updated_at": "1464229929", "user": "wmtan"}

The gun has number of parameters to tune phase-space of generate particles. It is planned to use the gun to produce a sample of displaced taus to train DNN-based tauID dedicated to displaced taus. \r\n\r\nThis PR contains the pythia8 gun itself and an example cfi file.\r\n\r\nIt is foreseen to back-port this gun to 12_4_X and 10_6_X for production of Run-3 and Run-2 samples.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe gun was tested by using it with typical gen-sim workflow (as Run-3 Summer21 production).\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 0, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1653981247", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["generators-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 38139, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Add pythia8 gun to generate particles with flat pt and Lxy (transverse displacement)", "updated_at": "1653981266", "user": "mbluj"}

A few particular cases keep no minimum threshold:\r\n        -- association of global TeV refits, as they are expected to select a subset of all the muon hits\r\n        -- association of seeds of standalone muons (standard or displaced), for a similar reason (they could be made of just one segment out of four stations)\r\n- bug fix in the (New) MuonTrackValidator: for HLT muon tracks the denominator of the efficiency was not correctly defined in events missing specific HLT muon track collections (in particular hltL3Muons and hltL3TkTracksFromL2). Curiously the bug appeared in recent releases, while it was not effective in an earlier test made in 900pre4 (with the same code).\r\n\r\nAs said each change has been tested on RelVals and the results are fine.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 20, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1506713064", "deletions": 61, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_0_X", "number": 20701, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "New muon validation bug fixes", "updated_at": "1513097612", "user": "abbiendi"}

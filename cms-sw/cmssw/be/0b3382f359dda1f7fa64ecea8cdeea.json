However, this configuration relied on the name of the default dataset, which a) isn't always set and b) no longer necessarily matches the workflow year because of the recent 2023 -> 2026 change in #27488. Instead, the year can be matched to the key directly.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested runTheMatrix.py to make sure the right PU configuration was assigned to each year.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1568829120", "comments": 12, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1568641716", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "pdmv-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "024cc8d3672669c912570a3e9762b1a6b279d4cf", "merged_at": "1568829120", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 28005, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "improve upgrade PU assignment", "updated_at": "1568829120", "user": "kpedro88"}

This is currently prevented by a defensive check that disallows reading products in a release prior to the release in which the product was created. This pull request adds a configurable option \"bypassVersionCheck\" to bypass this check. See\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/299538/material/slides/1.pdf\nfor the XEB report in which this commitment is documented.\nThis pull request is for 7_1_X only. It needs to be customized for other release cycles.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1406036602", "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1405020318", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["comparison-available", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "0e6dffccd763699168876ae046f7a0dcaea646cf", "merged_at": "1406036602", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "number": 4606, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Allow option of reading of files with prior releases (for 7_1_X)", "updated_at": "1408975795", "user": "wmtan"}

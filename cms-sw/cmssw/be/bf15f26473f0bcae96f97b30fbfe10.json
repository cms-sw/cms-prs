We're doing this in two steps instead of one since the data files also need to be updated. We ensure a smooth transition by first supporting both options and later removing the legacy one.\r\n- We fixed some issues with our includes and with an overflow that was sometimes happening.\r\n\r\nc.c. @slava77 @VourMa ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 16, "closed_at": "1738133313", "comments": 30, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1736533060", "deletions": 442, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved", "heterogeneous-approved", "tracking"], "merge_commit_sha": "878e0b4ecb83da9f2c00545a543792ecb22974b4", "merged_at": "1738133313", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_15_0_X", "number": 47084, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 19, "state": "closed", "title": "LST followups: better work divisions, concrete kernel dimension, some cleanup and fixes", "updated_at": "1738133315", "user": "ariostas"}

We're doing this in two steps instead of one since the data files also need to be updated. We ensure a smooth transition by first supporting both options and later removing the legacy one.\r\n- We fixed some issues with our includes and with an overflow that was sometimes happening.\r\n\r\nc.c. @slava77 @VourMa ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 16, "comments": 10, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1736533060", "deletions": 442, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending", "heterogeneous-pending", "tracking"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_0_X", "number": 47084, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 6, "state": "open", "title": "LST followups: better work divisions, concrete kernel dimension, some cleanup and fixes", "updated_at": "1737127650", "user": "ariostas"}

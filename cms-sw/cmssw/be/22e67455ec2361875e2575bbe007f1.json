Also prepare the handling of the MVA MET uncertainties, planned for 76X.\n\nModified packages are :\n- DataFormats/PatCandidates\n- JetMETCorrections/Type1MET\n- PhysicsTools/PatAlgos\n- PhysicsTools/PatUtils\n\nCode modifications :\n- add the photon ES uncertainties in the pat::MET format, was missing before\n- add automatic swich for JEC corrections betwee data and MC in the MET type1 code\n- move to CHS jets and CHS JEC correctiosn for the type1 MET per default\n- jet soft cleaning (electron/muon overlap removal) added per default in the uncertainty tool\n- update of the XY MET shift correction (74X version, latest one)\n- fix a bug in the XY MET shift correction computation\n- update of the type0 correction (74X version, latest one)\n- add shortcuts functions for the miniAOD production and re-production, with the minimal set of options needed by non-expert people. \n- add example config file to show how to reprocess the MET on top of miniAODs\n\nExpected changes :\n- central MET value will change a bit due to the switch to CHS, no strong effect expected\n- JES/JER MET uncertainties can change a bit due to the jet cleaning\n- XY and T0 changes will affect all METs with at least one of those corrections\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 23, "closed_at": "1442427428", "comments": 49, "commits": 20, "created_at": "1437038177", "deletions": 228, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "c24e237cac6cc2b3329f531313901e5c2caeabd5", "merged_at": "1442427428", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 10240, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "Various improvements and small fixes of the MET uncertainty tools", "updated_at": "1479107028", "user": "mmarionncern"}

This was required for fast timing studies.  I'm not sure how useful this would be in 75X but I thought I'd submit the PR and let you decide.  More details on #8975.\n\nThe option is off by default, to turn in it on requires\n\n```\nprocess.mix.digitizers.mergedtruth.createInitialVertexCollection = True\nprocess.FEVTDEBUGHLToutput.outputCommands.append('keep TrackingVertexs_mix_InitialVertices_*')\n```\n\nadded to the digi config file.  If on then at 0 pileup it adds 2980.5 bytes/event uncompressed, 695.2 bytes/event compressed (using workflow 38.0).  The figure quoted on #8975 is for 140 pileup, I'd expect it to be roughly proportional to pileup.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1431109819", "comments": 7, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1431002115", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "a21ed103042b818b21b938df10b2b2107d619a07", "merged_at": "1431109819", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 8989, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add option to save initial vertex collection (forward port of #8975)", "updated_at": "1438586418", "user": "mark-grimes"}

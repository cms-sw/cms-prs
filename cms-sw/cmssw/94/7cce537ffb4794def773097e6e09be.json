With the current logic, only `pat::Jet`s are accepted.\r\nThe fix is needed to use DeepJet at HLT. For the `reco::` case, features needed for DeepDoubleX are filled with the same dummy variables as in the case of no subjets.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nCode compiles.\r\n`40 39 38 29 18 4 1 1 1 tests passed, 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 failed`\r\nAlso, tested on data and MC samples, running a modified HLT menu with DeepJet instead of DeepCSV.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\nN/A\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 4, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1635687768", "deletions": 23, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-rejected", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_2_X", "number": 35922, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Fix charged and neutral candidate converters for reco::Jets", "updated_at": "1635693389", "user": "SWuchterl"}

Namely, the fix is a replacement of (shallow) copying by deep-copying of the original PSets. \r\n\r\nThe fix solves issues occurring when tauReco-at-mini configuration was pickled (e.g. when used with crab) or being a subject of `customiseEarlyDelete`. No changes expected in terms of performance.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nUnit test passed successfully. \r\nMatrix tests were not run as they are irrelevant in this PR because the modified cff is not included to official workflows.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1619892395", "comments": 12, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1619442038", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "c5d22d93e10c5a4ac6752bfdda12e7205cd33469", "merged_at": "1619892395", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "number": 33527, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix of anti-mu cff for tauReco at miniAOD", "updated_at": "1620628441", "user": "mbluj"}

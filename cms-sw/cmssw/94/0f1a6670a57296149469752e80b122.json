The changes applied to GEDPhotonProducer and PhotonProducer in terms of reading the DB cuts and parse them to the hcalESum functions likely need to be applied to GsfElectronAlgo, ConversionTrackCandidateProducer and ConvertedPhotonProducer in a very similar way.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 25, "comments": 11, "commits": 9, "created_at": "1698857678", "deletions": 103, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "hlt-pending", "operations-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-rejected"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "number": 43164, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "open", "title": "Change EGM code to be able to read HCAL PF thresholds from DB", "updated_at": "1699877374", "user": "RSalvatico"}

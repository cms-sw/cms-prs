This allows merging the four MTV instances into a single one, which further makes the summary plots meaningful (now they contain all the monitored HLT track collections instead of a single one). Add a DQMGenericClient to produce the efficiency, fake rate etc. for the summary plots as in offline validation.\n\nTested in CMSSW_7_6_X_2015-07-29-2300, expecting following changes only\n- MTV summary and simulation plots contain all monitored HLT track collections separately instead of being merged to a single bin\n- summary plots contain now efficiency, fake rate etc.\n\n@rovere @VinInn @mtosi \n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 8, "closed_at": "1439746026", "comments": 10, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1439296315", "deletions": 164, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "8cc8557e99c56fcf6a131e3e0c04039fa5f0ac00", "merged_at": "1439746026", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 10688, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Tracking HLT validation cleanup", "updated_at": "1476956829", "user": "makortel"}

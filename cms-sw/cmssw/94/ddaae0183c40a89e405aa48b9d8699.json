In case of anomalous differences (a tolerance is defined in the test) a message is written in the output of the unit test, causing it to fail.\r\n\r\nA minor code cleaning is added in the BTL digitization as well, no change is implied.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe test runs, provide the expected output, and the standard unit test succeeds with a tolerance defined at 0.5 microns for the difference between ideal and reconstructed positions (differences are below 250 nm).", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1617885035", "comments": 13, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1617714307", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "c64680d3927ec2175b6638f7c52adb2f178f900f", "merged_at": "1617885035", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 33342, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "MTD geometry: add test and unit test to probe the BTL pixel structure provided by RectanbgularMTDTopology", "updated_at": "1617885035", "user": "fabiocos"}

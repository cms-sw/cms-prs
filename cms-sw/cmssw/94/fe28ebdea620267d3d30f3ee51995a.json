To remove the warning the last is renamed to QuartzF.\n\n2) Heavy Boron Concrete definition had a minor problem: sum of mass fractions for components was not exact 1.0. The mass fraction of the first (largest) component is slightly increased.\n\n3) In trackermaterial.xml there were number of hidden symbols\n\nOverall this modifications should not affect any results.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "changed_files": 9, "closed_at": "1399487646", "comments": 4, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1399400123", "deletions": 55, "labels": ["comparison-available", "geometry-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "8780b8385c41eca3e9617c593305f3ea045b58e8", "merged_at": "1399487646", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_1_0_pre8", "number": 3704, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "fixed warnings on materials at SIM step", "updated_at": "1399487646", "user": "civanch"}

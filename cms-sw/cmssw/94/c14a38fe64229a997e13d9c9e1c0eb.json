This one is for DQM changes, equivalent to **part** of the [customise_DQM](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/CMSSW_8_0_X_2015-11-15-2300/SLHCUpgradeSimulations/Configuration/python/phase1TkCustoms.py#L86) function.\n\nNote that the commands in [line 99](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/CMSSW_8_0_X_2015-11-15-2300/SLHCUpgradeSimulations/Configuration/python/phase1TkCustoms.py#L99) onwards will come in another PR, i.e.\n\n``` python\n    from DQM.TrackingMonitor.customizeTrackingMonitorSeedNumber import customise_trackMon_IterativeTracking_PHASE1PU140\n    from DQM.TrackingMonitor.customizeTrackingMonitorSeedNumber import customise_trackMon_IterativeTracking_PHASE1PU70\n\n    if pileup>100:\n        process=customise_trackMon_IterativeTracking_PHASE1PU140(process)\n    else:\n        process=customise_trackMon_IterativeTracking_PHASE1PU70(process)\n```\n\n...are not implemented yet.  Those look to be quite involved changes that will probably be easier to integrate in smaller chunks.\n\n**There should be no change whatsoever unless the Run2_2017 era is active** (the only top-level era that contains phase1Pixel).\n\n@atricomi, @delaere, @boudoul, @makortel \n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": "1449730252", "comments": 7, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1447769335", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "a1515e7aa4ab7e122e2617880e9e4d9ff69708dc", "merged_at": "1449730252", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 12459, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "phase1Pixel era DQM additions part 1", "updated_at": "1449730252", "user": "mark-grimes"}

It can be either Phase 1 or Phase 2 scales. Then it is converted to `RegionalMuonCands` (Phase 1) or `SAMuons` (Phase 2);\r\n* Improvements and refactoring of `CandidateSimMuonMatcher` and `DataROOTDumper2` used for developments and validations.\r\n\r\nIn addition the PR contains a fix of bugs found in `DTTriggerPhase2` which are already included in #49589, but as it is not merged yet added here for self-consistency.\r\n\r\nDetails in [this JIRA ticket](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSL1TOMTF-26) and K.

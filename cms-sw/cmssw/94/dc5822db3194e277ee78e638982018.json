As a result, the DQM plots did not get made, although they would have been fine, physics-wise. Changing this flag to false is the easiest way to have similar DQM plots with the earlier and later HLT menus, and it fixes this bug.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this PR, some DQM plots will be removed, and some will reappear.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nUsing the 11634.0 ttbar workflow, I have tested that the correct histograms are produced and filled in the harvested DQM file.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nThis PR will need to be backported to 12_4_X, so it will go into the DQM offline GUI.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1666276069", "deletions": 14, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_6_X", "number": 39799, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Update & bug fix for offline DQM for EXO & HIG Run 3 muon paths", "updated_at": "1666325337", "user": "jalimena"}

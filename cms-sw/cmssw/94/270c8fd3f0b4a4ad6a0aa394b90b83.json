As you can see here:\n\nhttps://cmssdt.cern.ch/SDT/html/showIB.html#CMSSW_7_3_ROOT6_X_2014-10-22-0200\n\nI started from the branch CMSSW_7_3_ROOT6_X. I did <pre> git merge CMSSW_7_3_X </pre> and then I manually solved the conflicts with the help of @davidlt. \n\nI checked that https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/5975 does no affect the files CondFormats/PhysicsToolsObjects/interface/MVAComputer.h or\nCondFormats/PhysicsToolsObjects/src/MVAComputer.cc\n\nIf this is ok I can merge it and activate again the automatic merges which should work again. \n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_3_ROOT6_X", "changed_files": 230, "closed_at": "1414417282", "comments": 3, "commits": 76, "created_at": "1414410601", "deletions": 15670, "labels": ["alca-pending", "analysis-pending", "comparison-pending", "core-pending", "db-pending", "dqm-pending", "geometry-pending", "hlt-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "tests-rejected"], "number": 6017, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Manual merge 7_3_X into 7_3_ROOT6_X", "updated_at": "1414417282", "user": "nclopezo"}

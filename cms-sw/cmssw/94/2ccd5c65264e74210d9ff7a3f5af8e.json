The depth bit is set in the emulator in file `SimCalorimetry/HcalTrigPrimAlgos/src/HcalFinegrainBit.cc`. There was no restriction on abs(ieta) == 16, causing the depth bit to be set in the emulator in this region. A restriction was added to the emulator to match the firmware. Slides explaining the issues and showing changes to the depth bit in abs(ieta) == 16 are provided below. \r\n\r\n[Hazelton_reemul_fix.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18691409/Hazelton_reemul_fix.pdf)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nPassed runTheMatrix.py tests.

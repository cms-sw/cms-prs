This framework consists of two plugins. The first plugin performs a tag and probe (T&P) method to monitor scouting muon and vertex distributions and efficiencies. The second plugin is designed to monitor distributions and efficiencies of muon L1 seeds. \r\nPreviously the T&P only monitored muons from the J/Psi, and this PR added muons from the Z boson. \r\nThis PR also changes the way we monitor the muon L1 seeds. Instead of processing all the L1 seeds together, we process Single Muon and Double Muon seeds separately, so that we can add different restrictions to each of these. We add the restriction of eta < 0.8  for the Single Muon seeds to improve efficiency. \r\nThe development of this code was presented in several meetings:\r\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/1476209/\r\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/1492373/\r\nThe implementation was built on top of CMSSW_15_1_0_pre2\r\n**PR validation:**\r\nWe have checked out all dependencies and have a clean build. We applied the code-checks specified in PR #47235. Most runTheMatrix tests were successfully run as well, with a couple of errors coming from files not found:\r\n[runall-report-step123-.log](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19875718/runall-report-step123-.log)\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 7, "comments": 10, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1745435159", "deletions": 79, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 47938, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Run SingleMu and DoubleMu triggers separately and adapt to general workflow", "updated_at": "1745502040", "user": "JavierGarciadeCastro"}

The offsets are applied up front by the MixingModule using a new \"Adjuster\" class.  With this fix, neither the digit accumulators nor the CrossingFrames can apply the shifts, as they do not have write access to the hits.\n\nThis fix has been regression tested, but it needs to be tested that it does indeed fix the problem, and does not introduce other problems. In particular, it should be tested that the shifts are in fact applied.\n\nThis is the second pass at the fix.  The unneeded adjusters have been pruned.  All the relvals that failed the first time now pass.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 14, "closed_at": "1386081675", "comments": 37, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1385586254", "deletions": 243, "labels": ["core-approved", "fully-signed", "simulation-approved", "tests-rejected"], "merge_commit_sha": "16ead386b10c8c2d70675f80b592f2af8adf825e", "merged_at": "1386081675", "merged_by": "nclopezo", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_0_0_pre10", "number": 1615, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Protect against multiple shifting for out of time pileup", "updated_at": "1406909172", "user": "wmtan"}

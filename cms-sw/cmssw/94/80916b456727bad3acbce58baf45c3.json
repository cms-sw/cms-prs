The anticipated changes in performance have been studied and documented here (*). The new training is based on the Summer17 MC samples and will be referred to as 2017v1. \r\n\r\nWe hope for an integration still into 94X to have the new training included in the upcoming new MC production campaign. Standard tests show no differences beyond those that we expect to see. For more details and confirmation I refer to @mbluj, @steggema and @isobelojalvo \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nRoger\r\n\r\n(*)\r\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/675184/contributions/2766837/attachments/1546406/2427371/mbluj_TauId_GammaPtGt1GeV_24Oct2017.pdf\r\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/675184/contributions/2767859/attachments/1547023/2428479/mbluj_TauId_80XLegacyMiniAOD_24Oct2017.pdf\r\n  ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 22, "closed_at": "1509720300", "comments": 62, "commits": 19, "created_at": "1508957872", "deletions": 15, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "orp-approved", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "5fbe472eb3e049b751c00688c068f7e7408b9ffc", "merged_at": "1509720300", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_0_X", "number": 21022, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 6, "state": "closed", "title": "Adaptation to enable the use of a new MVAIsolation training", "updated_at": "1510914188", "user": "roger-wolf"}

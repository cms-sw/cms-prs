Some of the variables in HBHE noise filters use rechit multiplicity per RM, so cut values should be updated accordingly to account for the increase of rechit multiplicity. But, we know that the QIE11 channels dont have coherent noise [1], so we decided to exclude HE channels in the construction of filter variables; we use only HB channels to calculate the variables to cut on.\r\n\r\nWe use `HBHERecHitAuxSetter::OFF_TDC_TIME` bit in `HBHERecHit.auxPhase1()` to exclude QIE11 channels because the bit is set to 1 for QIE11 channels and to 0 for QIE8 channels. \r\n\r\nThis update will have a visible effect in MC reconstructed with full HE depth segmentation and a small effect in data. \r\n\r\nMore details can be found in [2]. \r\n\r\n[1] https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/pub/CMSPublic/HcalDPGResultsCMSDPS2017042/HEP17noise.pdf\r\n[2] https://indico.cern.ch/event/708228/contributions/2907553/attachments/1605989/2548603/20180223_Jae_HCAL_RemoveHEForNoise.pdf", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 8, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1519432496", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_1_X", "number": 22337, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[HBHE] Remove Phase 1 HE from HBHE noise filter consideration", "updated_at": "1519477381", "user": "jaehyeok"}

This PR is updated with the correct inputs based off the merged AOD OOT photons PR #18844 , as well as adding in PFClusterIsolations and separate basic clusters and supercluster collections for the OOT photons.\r\n\r\nSome explanations and validation is here: [update130617.pdf](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/files/1071654/update020617.pdf)\r\n\r\nWhile this PR is in the process of being merged, a separate PR will be opened on the issue of the legacy 2016 reminiaod in 9XY, following along #18828 .  The idea to have a separate PR is so that this change can be implemented as quickly as possible for 2017 data (as well as the MC campaign to start soon).\r\n\r\nIn preparation for the legacy reminaod, I removed the HoverE slimming in the reducedEgamma configuration for the OOT photons.  This added 0.001 photon / event to the OOT collection, as can be seen in the slides.  The total increase in size to miniAOD is roughly 240 B /event.\r\n\r\nAfter running runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all, all tests passed except three which had DAS errors (see:  [runall-report-step123.txt](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/files/1071659/runall-report-step123.txt))\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 17, "closed_at": "1498739977", "comments": 83, "commits": 13, "created_at": "1497355873", "deletions": 339, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "b493ac04b2a3beaba92e74f17e4e1b80c57b3392", "merged_at": "1498739976", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_3_X", "number": 19205, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 29, "state": "closed", "title": "Out-of-time photons for MiniAOD", "updated_at": "1501757906", "user": "kmcdermo"}

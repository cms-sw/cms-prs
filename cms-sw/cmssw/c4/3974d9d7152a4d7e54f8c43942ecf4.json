If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nThis PR can be easily backported to 14_0 series if needed - please let me know.\r\nBackport to 10_6 will require some effort as it will require also modifications at AOD and miniAOD steps and preparation of a set of new GTs therefore I would like to avoid this.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 7, "comments": 3, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1712733250", "deletions": 415, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "xpog-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 44685, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Modify tau sequences to not pull payloads from outside GT", "updated_at": "1712733757", "user": "mbluj"}

For that reason I ported it back to the original algorithm, see also http://amcatnlo.web.cern.ch/amcatnlo/mcatnlo_hwan_MLM.f\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1422374765", "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1403777467", "deletions": 65, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "generators-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "92a86c5c8c7996c1511eb746178a2bf2e29c548e", "merged_at": "1422374765", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "number": 4401, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Update hwmatch.F for FxFx-Merging with Herwig6", "updated_at": "1422374765", "user": "mharrend"}

However I still have to investigate about re-reco of non-scouting dataset.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI'm having some problems with the validation (https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/49331). I would like to check that all corner cases are covered (in particular I suspect that a re-reco of a non-scouting dataset might have problems)\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

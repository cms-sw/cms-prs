The photon pt cut, photon eta cut, isolation cone size, and isolation cut are configurable.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI have run this producer on a recent TTBar and HGG relval sample, and found that the producer produces the expected number of isolated photons in each case.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/28371\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1575634088", "comments": 12, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1573854027", "deletions": 11, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "generators-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved", "xpog-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "f344b2d57c589d63538a37ad00c66fb9fe42c24b", "merged_at": "1575634088", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 28411, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": " 106X backport of isolated particle level photon", "updated_at": "1575634088", "user": "AndrewLevin"}

This change will also simplify possible future extensions of the algorithms since the TagInfo EDProducer provides more flexibility than the current implementation inside an ESProducer.\n\nThe code changes, while introducing one new and modifying one old DataFormat, should be completely transparent to the standard reconstruction and MiniAOD production. Consequently, a backport to 80X could be considered.\n\n**Update (Oct. 12, 2016):** Implemented a more robust way of checking whether MiniAOD is being used based on the primary vertex collection name rather than the PF candidate collection name since Puppi candidates could be used instead of `packedPFCandidates`.\n\n@cvernier \n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 23, "closed_at": "1476539273", "comments": 32, "commits": 8, "created_at": "1475771863", "deletions": 779, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved", "urgent"], "merge_commit_sha": "9ee231113411b634645bfbbda6f200396bb0c61f", "merged_at": "1476539273", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 16124, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 8, "state": "closed", "title": "Implemented BoostedDoubleSVTagInfos", "updated_at": "1476607800", "user": "ferencek"}

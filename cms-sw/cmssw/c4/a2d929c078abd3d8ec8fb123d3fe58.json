This was tracked down to a memory leak due to undeleted raw pointer in GenParticles2HepMCConverter. This PR fixes that by switching to `unique_ptr`.\r\n> \r\n> #### PR validation:\r\n> \r\n> Tested with NANO matrix test and see much lower and stable memory usage after the fix.", "branch": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1728034495", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["generators-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 46254, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[14_1_X] Fix memory leak in GenParticles2HepMCConverter", "updated_at": "1728046863", "user": "hqucms"}

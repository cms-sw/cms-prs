Change in emulator does not effect MC production since the MC Global Tag is not updated.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 18, "closed_at": "1537869903", "comments": 22, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1536906800", "deletions": 142, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "4626d53e6562a9fe9f18f25a9f48d7cc858cb0fd", "merged_at": "1537869903", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_3_X", "number": 24539, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "sync OMTF code (as in tag omtfdev_mk20).", "updated_at": "1537869903", "user": "rekovic"}

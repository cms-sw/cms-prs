These illegal includes had to be fixed for the automatic BuildFile cleaning to work out.\r\n\r\nAs always, only the dependencies which are **not included in any of the sources** are removed, so these changes are orthogonal and complementary to the recent PRs which added all packages that are **actually included**.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCMSSW compiles. It was checked that all newly added dependencies are actually required by the package with `git grep`.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 12, "closed_at": "1604397641", "comments": 16, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1603351567", "deletions": 96, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "cd3ff1f967b880b3ecb2c90e773fd69cbb415de2", "merged_at": "1604397641", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 31898, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Clean BuildFiles in EventFilter", "updated_at": "1604397641", "user": "guitargeek"}

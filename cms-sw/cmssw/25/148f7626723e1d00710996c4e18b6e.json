As a general rule, no data products (ie. classes stored in *Formats subsystems) should have any dependency upon the framework itself, which includes how we configure the framework (i.e. the ParameterSet system).\r\n\r\nThis was prompted by the fact that the CXXMODULES IBs are failing because of ROOT's attempt to create a module from FWCore/ParameterSet. That failure caused many *Formats packages to also fail. If we remove the unnecessary dependency than we should be able to avoid having ROOT even attempt the parsing.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe code compiles.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 29, "closed_at": "1622672786", "comments": 22, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1622393414", "deletions": 69, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "db-approved", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "1ae79168c120c6825a7b98158a01a95b8b777ec5", "merged_at": "1622672786", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "number": 33897, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "Removed FWCore/ParameterSet dependecies from *Formats packages", "updated_at": "1622672786", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

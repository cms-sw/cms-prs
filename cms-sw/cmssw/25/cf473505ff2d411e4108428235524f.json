The PR just adds the functionality to select a different (generic) quantity as PU proxy, adding a switch (`usePUProxyValue`) and an `InputTag` to a `double` in the event. Some internal functions are renamed accordingly for clarity.\r\n\r\nThis small update is currently used in Phase-2 HLT-TDR studies, and the intention is to backport it to `11_1_X`.\r\n\r\nDefaults are unchanged, so no changes are expected in the comparisons.\r\n\r\nFYI: @lathomas @kirschen @fwyzard @trtomei @pallabidas\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nVerified in HLT-TDR studies that the updated code behaves as expected.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1607555835", "comments": 13, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1606759111", "deletions": 12, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "ece18d41746ef77a19ec464c7c499809bc5de455", "merged_at": "1607555835", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 32341, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "[Puppi] option to use generic PU proxy", "updated_at": "1607555835", "user": "missirol"}

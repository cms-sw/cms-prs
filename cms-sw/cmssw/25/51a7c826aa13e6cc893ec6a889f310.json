This will allow thread-safe comparisions.\nChanged const member functions to return const pointers to member data. This is also needed for thread-safety and was\ncaught by the static analyzer.\nAlso changed member data which were pointers to be const pointers in order to help  make future maintanence thread-safe.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1387299849", "comments": 6, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1387221646", "deletions": 45, "labels": ["fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "8eb8e95fdbcefb8b60ecaba15bb569f31e791657", "merged_at": "1387299849", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_0_0_pre11", "number": 1837, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Made MagGeometry thread safe", "updated_at": "1387469535", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

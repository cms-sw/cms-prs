Because edmClassVersion is currently disabled in ROOT6, it is non-trivial to get the checksums for ROOT6 and guarantee that they are correct..  Therefore, \"999999999\" is used as a placeholder for the checksum in the ROOT6 version.  When edmCheckClassVersion is turned back on, each instance of \"999999999\" can then be easily changed to the correct checksum.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_ROOT6_X", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1392321455", "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1392318485", "deletions": 9, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "68f81e6004aeceb595ee98420c4332457a9bc577", "merged_at": "1392321455", "merged_by": "ktf", "number": 2460, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Update Class Versions of classes impacted by ROOT 6", "updated_at": "1392576257", "user": "wmtan"}

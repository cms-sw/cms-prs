It is clear that the problem is numerical - for small steps of electrons of low energy numerical precsion is lost in Geant4 computations. This PR provide work around this rare problem. No change in SIM hits for low statistic run is expected.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nLocally the problem was not yet reproduced but this approach was validated previously in similar circonstances with more frequent problems.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

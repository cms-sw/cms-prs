The information is slightly redundant but as they are there, it is our view we might as well fill them. \n\nIt is related to https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/6479.  I decided not to add back in the error message is its still possible that this error condition can happen if we changed the python config and its not technically an error.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_3_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1416844930", "comments": 13, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1416588483", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "8f5f7b6836572b782542ca907e326c7c2226f72b", "merged_at": "1416844930", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_3_X", "number": 6545, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fixing electron selection pre-selection flags", "updated_at": "1416844930", "user": "Sam-Harper"}

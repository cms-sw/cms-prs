Usually this candidate had a low Et ecal seed and a high-pt (fake) track. While this did not seem to hurt our jet energy resolution, it does mess up spectra measurements, where high pT fake jets really change the measurement.\n\n@doanhien has been studying ways to reduce these fake PF electrons, and an easy cut we can add is a 15GeV cut on electron seeds. This significantly reduces the number of fake jets without significantly changing analysis-level electrons.\n\nThis PR should not change any pp workflows at all, only HI workflows. It will be followed up by a backport to 75X as well.\n\nThe cuts added to ecalDrivenGsfElectrons and gedGsfElectronsTmp are simply to silence a warning about inconsistent cuts at seed and ElectronProducer level, and make no physics difference in addition to the ecalDrivenElectronSeeds cut.\n\nSome further plots and cross-checks:\n1) Robustness of JER to cuts: https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/pub/CMS/PhotonAnalyses2015/JERJES_pT80_PbPb_PFElecComp.pdf\n\n2) Reduction of fake jets with this cut: https://hypernews.cern.ch/HyperNews/CMS/get/hi-general/2248/1/1.html\n\n3) Analysis-level effects of these cuts: https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/PhotonAnalyses2015#2015_07_21_13_30_CET\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1438838797", "comments": 14, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1438352864", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "0aa2a743cbe095c23b88163d61dfb0e23a56bebb", "merged_at": "1438838797", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 10504, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add 15GeV cut to electron seeds for HI workflow", "updated_at": "1438838798", "user": "richard-cms"}

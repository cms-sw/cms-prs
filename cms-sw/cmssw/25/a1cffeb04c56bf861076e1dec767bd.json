This is done by setting a `string` data member in `ConnectionPool` or the corresponding parameter in a `ParameterSet`. An unit test has been added. The default is `\"\"`, so the current behaviour is kept.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 342, "closed_at": "1453496177", "comments": 12, "commits": 13, "created_at": "1453296646", "deletions": 15746, "labels": ["alca-approved", "comparison-available", "db-pending", "l1-approved", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "75f576fa93da3bd78b12022c7e8f505ea788ed11", "merged_at": "1453496177", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 13012, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Cleanup of dependencies from CondDBv1 code by moving to CondDBv2, and new interface for logging and FronTier security", "updated_at": "1453904841", "user": "ggovi"}

In order to make things transparent, I add in ```DDCMS``` a few ```using``` statements included in ```DDD``` which may help in making transparent the migration. \r\n\r\nA non trivial dependence remains in ```GeometricDetExtras``` and into its timing counterpart. As far as I can see:\r\n\r\n- the use of ```DDExpandedNode``` is real, and a fully independent implementation of similar functionalities should be made using DD4hep if needed, so far there is none;\r\n\r\n- this is anyway not impacting the persistent ```PGeometricDet```;\r\n\r\n- the use of this object is for pure debugging purpose only, as far as I can see, so in principle its removal should not break production workflows. For sure this is true for ```GeometricTimingDetExtras``` that appears to be a cut-and-paste minimal adjustment of the tracker code, never used and not providing meaningful results at present as far as I can see.\r\n\r\nFor this reason I propose here a simple removal of this part for MTD, to be possibly replaced with something else in future. But there are already debugging classes that can be possibly extended in case.\r\n\r\nAs far as Tracker geometry is concerned, it is up to the DPG experts say whether they still need these functionalities, and in case provide a DD4hep-based implementation (that could replace asymptotically the DDD implementation).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nMTD geometry unit tests and wf 23234.0 run.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 17, "closed_at": "1592838588", "comments": 29, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1592400487", "deletions": 641, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "2fe8c7a23ca470ac36918a5b095edd390b25412d", "merged_at": "1592838588", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 30276, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 6, "state": "closed", "title": "Tracker/MTD geometry: clean Geometric(Timing)Det dependence on DDD", "updated_at": "1592838589", "user": "fabiocos"}

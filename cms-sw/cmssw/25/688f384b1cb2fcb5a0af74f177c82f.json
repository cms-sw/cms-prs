The `std::sort` requires the comparison functor to meet the requirements of [`Compare`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/Compare) (loosely needs \"less than\"), which the current \"less or equal than\" does not meet, leading to undefined behavior. This PR changes the functors to use \"less than\" comparison.\r\n> \r\n> Furthermore, as pointed out in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/31258#issuecomment-683773504, this PR proposes to fix a logic bug in the code that assumes `std::sort()`  to be stable (it is not) by combining the two comparison operations into one, and replacing the function structs with lambdas.\r\n> \r\n> For consistency this PR also changes the subsequent call to `std::unique()` to use a lambda instead of function object.\r\n> \r\n\r\nResolves #31410.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe crash reported in #31410 disappears, limited matrix runs.", "branch": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1599720484", "comments": 9, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1599688307", "deletions": 29, "labels": ["backport-ok", "bug-fix", "comparison-available", "l1-pending", "orp-approved", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "6e29f933a55075d21c389b6cc1d812564b047ed3", "merged_at": "1599720484", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 31416, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix sorting in TTUTrackingAlg (10_6_X)", "updated_at": "1599726713", "user": "makortel"}

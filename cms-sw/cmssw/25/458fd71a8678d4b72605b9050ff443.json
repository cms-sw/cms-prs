Kinematics of the ootPhotons and other variables did not change. The chosen workflow is not the best though (only 4 OOT photons in 200 events). \r\nFrom visual inspection (confirmed by @kmcdermo ) this PR should produce correct outputs.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1497893009", "comments": 29, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1497556302", "deletions": 12, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "d7c0a73a7d64ecd404b28aad64cdd0cd5d435336", "merged_at": "1497893009", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_2_X", "number": 19264, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "migrate ootPhoton to use GEDPhotonProducer", "updated_at": "1497893009", "user": "slava77"}

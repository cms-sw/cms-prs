One reason was the fastsim was directly rewriting Configuration.StandardSequences.Reconstruction_cff from within FastSimulation.Configuration.Reconstruction_AftMix_cff which was leading to very 'brittle' configuration code. For example, if someone accidently loaded Reconstruction_cff into the Process before Reconstruction_AftMix_cff the configuration would no longer work. Switching to fully using the fastSim era avoids many problems and makes fastsim behave like the other configuration modification workflows.

This is done both for the IT and OT(OT is still only in standalone configuration) \r\n- A new module is introduced for Harvesting, which does the fits of the residual 2D histos of the previous point to make plots of mean residual and resolution from as a function of eta-phi\r\n- For finding the closest simhit for rechits, and clusters - squared distance is used\r\n- A new harvesting util is also added.\r\n- The harvester module can also be configured to run for OT but it can only be used in standalone mode now.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nChecked with wf 23234.0\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\nNA\r\ncc @emiglior @mmusich @tsusa", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 17, "closed_at": "1623881444", "comments": 39, "commits": 11, "created_at": "1622111910", "deletions": 565, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "72459f6cd02aebe4db1b9ecd5ec33ccddcf3c455", "merged_at": "1623881444", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "number": 33863, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 13, "state": "closed", "title": "TkDQM: add rechit harvester module for IT", "updated_at": "1623881444", "user": "sroychow"}

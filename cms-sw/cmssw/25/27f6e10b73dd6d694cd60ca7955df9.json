Also. used in several DPG analysis codes. Strange that it was not in the repository for so long\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe added chi file has been tested externally in the context of phi symmetry studies. Then use the runTheMatrix test workflows to see that it does not interfere with any of the existing workflow.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

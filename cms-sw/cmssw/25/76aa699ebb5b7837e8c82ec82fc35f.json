Changes were made to \r\nAlignment/APEEstimation/macros/DrawIteration.C and \r\nAlignment/APEEstimation/macros/commandsDrawIteration.C\r\nto use phase 1 geometry.\r\n\r\n- This only affects the plotting tools\r\n\r\nOther changes include a small automation of the APE determination workflow in the following files:\r\nAlignment/APEEstimation/cfgTemplatesData/run15Iterations.bash\r\nAlignment/APEEstimation/cfgTemplatesData/run10Iterations.bash\r\nAlignment/APEEstimation/cfgTemplates/batchSubmitTemplate.tcsh\r\n\r\n- Before, one had to manually specify a sleeping time between iterations, waiting for batch jobs to finish\r\n- Now, as soon as all batch jobs of an iteration have finished, the sleeping is ended\r\n\r\nThe old workflow is kept in the following files for now:\r\nAlignment/APEEstimation/cfgTemplatesData/manual_run15Iterations.bash\r\nAlignment/APEEstimation/cfgTemplatesData/manual_run10Iterations.bash\r\n\r\nFinally, the deprecated use of CondCore.DBCommon.CondDBCommon_cfi was removed from\r\nAlignment/APEEstimation/test/SkimProducer/skimProducer_cfg.py.\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_9_2_X", "changed_files": 8, "closed_at": "1507664859", "comments": 7, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1507638805", "deletions": 118, "labels": ["alca-pending", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_9_2_X", "number": 20877, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Ape phase one plus tools", "updated_at": "1507664859", "user": "mteroerd"}

The result is that the usual interactions with the ME are now locked and thread-safe, similar to the `ConcurrentMonitorElement`. This means we can now drop the `ConcurrentMonitorElement` and instead use `MonitorElement*`. Of course there are still plenty of non-thread-safe interactions in the `MonitorElement`, but these should not be used.\r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/schneiml/cmssw/blob/dqm-new-dqmstore-on-CMSSW_11_0_0_pre5/DQMServices/Core/src/MonitorElement.cc\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nNo output changes expected, and none observed.\r\nHowever, some of the tests where probably incorrect -- the code was almost certainly uncompilable yet passed the tests.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 60, "closed_at": "1573244861", "comments": 200, "commits": 17, "created_at": "1569838807", "deletions": 2277, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "core-approved", "dqm-approved", "hlt-approved", "l1-pending", "orp-approved", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "8f02b2b7be76c003d2f7096c1e9f7e949caf7965", "merged_at": "1573244860", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 28092, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 12, "state": "closed", "title": "DQM: Merge MonitorElement and ConcurrentMonitorElement", "updated_at": "1573251674", "user": "schneiml"}

This change makes sure that we only match files with start with '++'.\r\n\r\n- For MessageService tests, add `log_path` in `UBSAN_OPTIONS` env so that ubsan dumps its output in separate file.\r\n\r\n- For FWCore/Services: Increase the RSS/VSize limits to 1.5 ( ubsan consumes a bit more memory)\r\n\r\nLocal tests for UBSAN shows that test runs after this change", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 8, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1683274907", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["core-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_2_X", "number": 41554, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[UBSAN] Fix for FWCore unit tests", "updated_at": "1683277016", "user": "smuzaffar"}

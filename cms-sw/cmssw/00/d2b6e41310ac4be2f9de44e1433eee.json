It was intentionally not included in PR #32764 and scheduled for a separate PR (this one). \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nResults already discussed in the context of the previous PR #32764 where a version equivalent to this code has been tested.\r\nIt was retested on relvals. Small differences observable in a fraction of the events.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1613696894", "comments": 10, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1613491974", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "fc2f96c8b379af8e631b0d0874c71c0b7d124499", "merged_at": "1613696893", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 32924, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "add missing Tc updates before cluster merging", "updated_at": "1613696894", "user": "werdmann"}

Only jet mass scale/resolution is improved.\n\nPresentations at xPOG and JetMET\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/320480/contribution/8\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/322766/contribution/5\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_2_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1406867563", "comments": 25, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1405495911", "deletions": 44, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "313ae7b4eb6792e0ddd8c168721b240de74d77c1", "merged_at": "1406867563", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_2_X", "number": 4668, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 4, "state": "closed", "title": "Adapt PF algorithm for high pT jet substructure", "updated_at": "1406867564", "user": "ahinzmann"}

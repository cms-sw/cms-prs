In particular, the FakeESSources should be dependent on the TrackerTopologyRcd and not the IdealGeometryRcd. Furthermore, these records are now of the type DependentRecordImplementation instead of EventSetupRecordImplementation. Now the records  correctly defined and getting filled properly.\n(corresponding code is not used in any production workflow)\n@boudoul @jlagram @dimattia @nickmccoll @venturia \n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1474542751", "comments": 20, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1472649153", "deletions": 21, "labels": ["alca-approved", "comparison-available", "db-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "90f7653ceb42dcdcd77ef98a1bc4abc3d1d8c91c", "merged_at": "1474542751", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 15685, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Bugfix in SiStrip Calibration Code", "updated_at": "1474542751", "user": "suchandradutta"}

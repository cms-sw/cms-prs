In the case of offline running the lumiSec should be given as -1. This allows special cases for differing plots between online and offline.\r\nDead and inefficient ROC monitoring are the first trend plots to be included.\r\n\r\nIn addition three changes have made to the summary maps:\r\n - Grand summary is now in the EventInfo directory to be automatically collected by the GUI.\r\n - Bins are now filled with percentage of modules that pass the quality test rather than the simple 'warning' and 'error' previously.\r\n - Protection against not booking/accessing empty MEs added", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1496296418", "comments": 17, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1496046188", "deletions": 13, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "7a95f7e14a9e2e0b37512fa87cc859e999d8831e", "merged_at": "1496296418", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_2_X", "number": 18993, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 5, "state": "closed", "title": "Updates to pixel phase 1 summary class", "updated_at": "1496296418", "user": "leggat"}

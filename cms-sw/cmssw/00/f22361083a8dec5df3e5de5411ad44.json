This additional memory is used by PluginManager cache.\r\n\r\nAs a simple (albeit a bit hacky) workaround, this PR adds hooks to the MaxMemoryPreload that allow its data collection to be paused, and uses those hooks in PluginManager to paused the data collection during the cache file reading. \r\n\r\nResolves https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/46359\r\nResolves https://github.com/cms-sw/framework-team/issues/1074\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested the impact with two developer areas of CMSSW_14_2_0_pre2: one with many packages checked out, and one with only two packages (`FWCore/PluginManager` and `PerfTools/MaxMemoryPreload`).

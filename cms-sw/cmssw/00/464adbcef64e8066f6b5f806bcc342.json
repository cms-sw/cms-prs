Also a bug fixing.\r\n\r\n- Update the name of the last filter of the single muon trigger \"HLT_IsoMu24\". This is necessary as the name has changed from the trigger menu used in Run2 to the one in Run3.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTests have been performed manually\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nThis PR is a backport in order to have the DQM Offline ready for the current data taking.\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1658097889", "comments": 6, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1657650342", "deletions": 16, "labels": ["dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "53deae55d5ad017ae157b7912e4c5441af4eadae", "merged_at": "1658097889", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 38710, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Code maintenance and preparation for Run III in the DQMOffline ZCounting", "updated_at": "1658097889", "user": "davidwalter2"}

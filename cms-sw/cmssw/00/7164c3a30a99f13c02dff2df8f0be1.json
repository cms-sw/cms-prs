It provided IO rules for backward compatibility with previously created ROOT files. Unfortunately, an IO rule for ``projection`` data member was missing. The present PR adds this missing PR.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation\r\n\r\nThis PR was tested with a UL AOD file (created with 10_6 which doesn't have the class members renamed). Before applying the proposed change, the method ``TotemRPUVPattern::projection()`` returns 0 (invalid). With the proposed changes, the method returns 1 or 2, as expected.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1596795860", "comments": 13, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1596706885", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "c21aee5ddc74bc22d8fc50b09db71a9e8cb690bc", "merged_at": "1596795860", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 31075, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "PPS: adding missing IO rule for class TotemRPUVPattern", "updated_at": "1596795860", "user": "jan-kaspar"}

Screenshot is attached below and shows that the variable is correctly filled. The config and the output can be found in CERN AFS at the path /afs/cern.ch/work/a/asahasra/public/ScoutingStudy/For2024ScoutingEGUpdate/TestSecondRoundOfCommits/CMSSW_14_0_0_pre3/src and are named as configHLT1330V22Fbrem_ScoutingPF.py and outputHLT1330V22Fbrem_ScoutingPF.root respectively. \r\n - The relevant for the customisation for the menu is at the path /afs/cern.ch/work/a/asahasra/public/ScoutingStudy/For2024ScoutingEGUpdate/TestSecondRoundOfCommits/CMSSW_14_0_0_pre3/src/HLTrigger/Configuration/python/customizeHLTforScouting.py.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1510\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/assets/32368439/c3f55f61-31d5-49a0-a71e-4374361b935d\">\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1707223943", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["hlt-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "bug-fix", "backport"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "number": 43880, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Implement the GSF Track fBrem Variable Filling for Scouting Electrons: 14_0", "updated_at": "1707225337", "user": "arsahasransu"}

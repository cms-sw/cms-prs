It adds back the hardware provenance printout that was originally part of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/47355, and was reverted in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/47473, but as optional (via `--hardware`) in order to use it in the two tests, while keeping the default behavior such that works with CRAB.\r\n\r\nThis is a little bit of quick-and-dirty, but will be replaced with an overall better process history printout in the near future.\r\n\r\nResolves https://github.com/cms-sw/framework-team/issues/1274\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles, the two (CPU) tests failed in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/47416#issuecomment-2688964199 succeed.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

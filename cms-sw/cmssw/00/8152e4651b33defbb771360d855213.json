However, this results in invalid proxy object\r\nbecause the copy and move constructors were never correctly  implemented\r\nin RooFit. This right alternative is to use a `RooListProxy`, which this\r\ncommit suggests to implement.\r\n\r\nThis makes CMSSW compile again with ROOT master, where the `RooRealProxy`\r\nmove constructor was deleted to avoid the creation of invalid RooFit objects.\r\n\r\nAddresses https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/11188.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCMSSW compiles.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

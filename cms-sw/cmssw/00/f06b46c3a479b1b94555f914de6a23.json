Effects of the update on track reconstructions efficiency and fakes are small.\r\n\r\n\r\n### PR validation:\r\n\r\nDetails of performance after this PR have been presented at TRK POG meeting on November 1st: \r\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/1092090/#2-mkfit-status-report\r\n\r\nFull MTV results, including the update of cms-sw/cmsdist#7427 and cms-data/RecoTracker-MkFit#7 on November 9th:\r\n- TTbar with PU: https://mmasciovecchio.web.cern.ch/MkFit_hitSelectionWindows_Nov21/MTV_TTbar_PU_PR35974_updateNov9_12X/\r\n- High-pT QCD without PU: https://mmasciovecchio.web.cern.ch/MkFit_hitSelectionWindows_Nov21/MTV_highPtQCD_noPU_PR35974_updateNov9_12X/\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1636603437", "comments": 24, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1635959096", "deletions": 13, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "urgent", "requires-external", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "c7d19e45d1f344ef84466db8256086c4be841916", "merged_at": "1636603437", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_2_X", "number": 35974, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 10, "state": "closed", "title": "Update mkFit for CMSSW_12_2_0", "updated_at": "1636603437", "user": "mmasciov"}

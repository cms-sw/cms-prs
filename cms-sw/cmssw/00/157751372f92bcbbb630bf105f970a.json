It implements what is know internally as \"v6.1_l1\" tracking. That consists of L1 tracks +  pixelTracks (w cluster removal from L1) + initialStep (seeded from pixelTracks as recovery) + highPtTriplet step.\r\nThis is the initial commit for that line of work, so no changes expected.\r\nThis is the initial commit for that line of work, so it does not depend on any other PR or externals.\r\nDocumentation:\r\n  * Tracking v6.1, by Hevjin Yarar and Mia Tosi:  [here](https://indico.cern.ch/event/909499/contributions/3826040/subcontributions/304054/attachments/2032371/3401815/Presentation_-_May_5_2020.pdf)\r\n  * Configuration with L1 tracks added before all L1 tracking, by Adriano di Florio: [here](https://indico.cern.ch/event/934495/contributions/3926174/subcontributions/310046/attachments/2070167/3475102/HLT_Phase2_Status_Jul2020_Upgrade.pdf)\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nAdded two files in HLTrigger/Configuration/test subdirectory to test the new functionalities. Only python code is changed, except for `SeedGeneratorFromL1TTracksEDProducer.cc `, that is only used in HLT Phase 2 tracking anyway. More testing is probably needed.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nThis is a backport of ZZZ, to be able to run HLT Phase 2 tracking in CMSSW_11_1_X .", "branch": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "changed_files": 86, "closed_at": "1598282705", "comments": 26, "commits": 9, "created_at": "1595030737", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "hlt-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 30817, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 42, "state": "closed", "title": "Adding baseline tracking for HLT Phase 2", "updated_at": "1598282705", "user": "trtomei"}

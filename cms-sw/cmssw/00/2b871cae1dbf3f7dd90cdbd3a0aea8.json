It includes fixes were needed to avoid errors after adding in the objects to the EventContent. One error that came up in the FEVTDEBUGHLToutput_step was: The class \"l1t::TkJetWord\" is compiled and for its data member \"tkJetWord_\" we do not have a dictionary for the collection \"bitset<70>\". Because of this, we will not be able to read or write this data member.\r\nclasses_def.xml was adjusted to avoid the error. Local PR: https://github.com/cms-l1t-offline/cmssw/pull/1048/\r\n\r\nThis PR also adds missing collections for Phase 2 tau-jet-met to the event content. Specifically the 9x9 Sums for histogrammed jets, the NN Puppi taus, and the HPS taus.

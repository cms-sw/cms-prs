A summary of this PR can be found on this [slides](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/files/8521728/HLT-Muon-Displaced.pdf).\r\n\r\nWhen this module was used with displaced muons a degradation in efficiency and resolution was observed. The reason was that this module was taking the innerTrack of the muon by default for momentum estimation. For displaced muons its better to take the globalTrack as shown in the attached slides (better efficiency and resolution).\r\n\r\nWe propose to add a flag to turn on the displaced reconstruction. This flag is set false by default to not interfere with the prompt reconstruction.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis PR passed the `scram b runtests` and code quality checks.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1650873143", "comments": 16, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1650466372", "deletions": 14, "labels": ["hlt-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-rejected", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "7f48b046bc7cfce37ced9eea6dd1203b8d7365c8", "merged_at": "1650873142", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 37636, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 5, "state": "closed", "title": "Update of L3MuonCandidateProducerFromMuons to work also with displaced", "updated_at": "1650873143", "user": "alexsr-98"}

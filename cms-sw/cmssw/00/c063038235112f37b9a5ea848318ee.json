Eg. for digis, `enableDigi` toggles running over GPU and CPU digi collections (creates CPU value 1D distribution and 1D GPU-CPU value difference by default), `digi1D` enables GPU value 1D distribution, and `digi2D` enables the 2D plots plots mentioned above\r\n- Create separate dedicated client for GPU validation on ECAL online DQM\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses the remaining outstanding tasks in this issue: https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/37025\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nOnline DQM configuration tested on test file provided by DQM-DC containing the new HLT collections. Offline DQM configuration tested on CPU-only and GPU WFs (`runTheMatrix.py -w upgrade -l 11634.511,11634.512,11634.513`).\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nThis is a backport of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/38427 to use in data taking", "branch": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 25, "commits": 9, "created_at": "1655703236", "deletions": 63, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "new-feature", "backport-ok", "ecal"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 38428, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[12_3_X Backport] ECAL DQM GpuTask add 2D comparison histograms and enable GPU validation on online DQM", "updated_at": "1656505339", "user": "alejands"}

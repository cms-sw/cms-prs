Eg. for digis, `enableDigi` toggles running over GPU and CPU digi collections (creates CPU value 1D distribution and 1D GPU-CPU value difference by default), `digi1D` enables GPU value 1D distribution, and `digi2D` enables the 2D plots plots mentioned above\r\n- Enable the module in online DQM, reading data from an HLT stream rather than rerunning CPU and GPU reco inside of DQM\r\n- The modifier `GpuValidationEcal` can now be used to change the input tags back to the original collections (eg. `ecalDigis@cpu`/`ecalDigis@cuda`) for offline DQM use\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses the remaining outstanding tasks in this issue: https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/37025\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nOnline DQM configuration tested on test file provided by DQM-DC containing the new HLT collections. Offline DQM configuration tested on CPU-only and GPU WFs (`runTheMatrix.py -w upgrade -l 11634.511,11634.512,11634.513`).\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nThis is a backport of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/38427 to use in data taking", "branch": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "changed_files": 6, "comments": 6, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1655703236", "deletions": 81, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "new-feature", "backport", "ecal"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 38428, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[12_3_X Backport] ECAL DQM GpuTask add 2D comparison histograms and enable GPU validation on online DQM", "updated_at": "1655708786", "user": "alejands"}

This fix moves the assignment of muonRecHitsThetaBest following the check if (dtheta > dthetamax) inside the loop.\r\n@drkovalskyi @folguera ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1512553292", "comments": 24, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1510302205", "deletions": 7, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "d431fe15a68715484d08dba450a4951a55476d67", "merged_at": "1512553292", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_0_X", "number": 21252, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Solve a possible bug found in RecoMuon/MuonIdentification/src/MuonShowerInformationFiller.cc", "updated_at": "1514280831", "user": "perrotta"}

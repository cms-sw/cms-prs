That is, for the strip tracker we follow the digiSimLink directly back to the simHit.  This is in contrast to the previous fix (PRs 2279, 2285, 3021, 3637), where the match was indirect through the simTrack, and is sometimes ambiguous.\nHere we add a bit to the stripDigiSimLink to specify the Low- vs High-Tof collection, which in combination with the detID.subDet allows the collection-relative pointers to be used.  The digitizer supplies this information on creation of the digiSimLink.  The hitAssociator now uses this information.  I hope I've implemented this in a way that preserves the thread-safe behavior of the hitAssociator.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_2_X", "changed_files": 8, "closed_at": "1404973352", "comments": 22, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1404418147", "deletions": 85, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "0992266411c817117a398c701dc99321a354fb52", "merged_at": "1404973352", "merged_by": "degano", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_2_X", "number": 4520, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "strip digitizer stores tofBin, hitAssociator uses CFpos", "updated_at": "1405395761", "user": "wmtford"}

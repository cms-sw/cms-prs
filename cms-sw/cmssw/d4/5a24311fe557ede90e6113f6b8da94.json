The parameters were missing after the changes made in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/43846 for the configurations reorganization. \r\n \r\nFor TrackValidation:\r\n- remove time selection on generalTracksFromPV, enabled after the changes in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/43592. Since 3D vertices now have time, the tracks from 3D vertices have an additional time selection enabled, which causes a loss in efficiency of 5-10%. The time selection is removed for the validation of tracksFromPV.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested on TTbar_14TeV+PU200, expected changes in Tracking/TracksFromPV with the recovery of track efficiency loss.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 6, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1714458201", "deletions": 8, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "tracking"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 44872, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "MTD: fix phase-2 config for RecoVertex and RecoTrack", "updated_at": "1714493221", "user": "kdeleo"}

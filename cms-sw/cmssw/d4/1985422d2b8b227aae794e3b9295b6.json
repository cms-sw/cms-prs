I have tested both in `CMSSW_11_2_X_2020-06-01-2300` and `CMSSW_11_2_PY3_X_2020-06-01-2300`\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nThis PR is not a backport, but it will be backported to 11.1.X.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1591204056", "comments": 12, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1591099213", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["alca-approved", "bug-fix", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "3b747fd9b5470de4f6cf0de0debe294a6ea44310", "merged_at": "1591204056", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 30077, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "[Tracker Alignment] All-in-one tool support of multiple tags in user-inputed sqlite file", "updated_at": "1591263494", "user": "mmusich"}

The inclusion of these modules in runTheMatrix workflow configurations came up in failures following `CUDADataFormats` dictionary removal in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/49656#issuecomment-3680875452. Since all direct CUDA components are slated for removal (https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/45844), this PR suggests to remove them. These components seem to have been superseded by more generic ones in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/45206.\r\n\r\nResolves https://github.com/cms-sw/framework-team/issues/1742\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nWorkflows 11634.5 and 34434.5 succeeded.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 8, "comments": 4, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1766419568", "deletions": 1474, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "trk"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_1_X", "number": 49697, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Remove obsolete CUDA-using modules from DQM/SiPixelHeterogeneous", "updated_at": "1766419674", "user": "makortel"}

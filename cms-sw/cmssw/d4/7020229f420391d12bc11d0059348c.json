I should have made it so that no EMTFTrack is produced for muon shower only DAQ blocks. Now this is fixed. \r\n\r\nThis is a backport of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/42172\r\n\r\nI don't know which release will be used when LHC restarts, but this backport might be necessary for some re-emulation studies with 2023 data.  \r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with a description of the feature proposed or problem addressed, specifying:\r\n  - what changes are expected in the output if any, \r\n  - what other PRs or externals it depends upon if any,\r\n  - link to any additional material useful to provide a documentation for this PR (slides, JIRA tickets, related pull requestes, hypernews, TWiki or Indico pages)  -->\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nValidated by running on recent data, behaves expectedly.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with a description of which tests have been performed to verify the correctness of the PR, including the eventual addition of new code for testing like unit tests, test configurations, additions or updates to the runTheMatrix test workflows -->\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

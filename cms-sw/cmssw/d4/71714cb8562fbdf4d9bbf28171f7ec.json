Change trivial statement `getBend() == getBend()` to `getBend() == rhs.getBend()`\r\n- `CSCCLCTData` was renamed to `CSCComparatorData`, since CLCTs are contained in the TMB data. \r\n- The unit test for CLCTs with 2007 firmware was fixed, and a unit test for 2013 firmware was added. \r\n- Several very old configurations (predating CMSSW `_cfg.py` style) have been deleted.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested with WF 27434.0\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nN/A", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 29, "closed_at": "1592397788", "comments": 54, "commits": 8, "created_at": "1591368399", "deletions": 555, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "a2e8134f7e26a402bc5013cd5db0f9bed1d9eb02", "merged_at": "1592397788", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 30128, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 8, "state": "closed", "title": "Update accessor in CLCT and LCT data formats", "updated_at": "1592398236", "user": "dildick"}

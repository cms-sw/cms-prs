In this Pull Request I have added this functionality through a new module called MuonTiming (MuonTiming.cc, MuonTiming.h and muonTiming_cfi.py) that takes care of booking and filling a few histograms (22 in total) related to the timing. In addition I have performed some bug fixes in the ranges and binning of some histograms in the DiMuonHistograms.cc and also in MuonKinVsEtaAnalyzer.cc.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 8, "closed_at": "1494480420", "comments": 22, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1491575365", "deletions": 58, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "f520e4fec19320a4fa975f5eb915007321767b87", "merged_at": "1494480420", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_2_X", "number": 18267, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 16, "state": "closed", "title": "Inclusion of muon timing plots in the DQMOffline/Muon package", "updated_at": "1494480420", "user": "parbol"}

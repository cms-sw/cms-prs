Since this is called per track, this makes the plugin very slow. \r\nThis change proposes to move the `getByToken` call up in the stack to `trackStudy` method. For subsequent function calls, a `const edm::DetSetVector<SiStripDigis>&` is passed down the stack. \r\n\r\nAnother proposed (but not implemented) change is to removed the methods `trackStudyFromTrack` and `hitStudy`, since these methods are never called.

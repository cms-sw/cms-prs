The changes are as follows.\r\n\r\n`CondTools/Geometry/test/writehelpers/geometryExtended2021_writer.py` -- remove improper DD4hep dependence from this DDD script.\r\n\r\n`DetectorDescription/OfflineDBLoader/plugins/OutputDDToDDL.cc` -- fix to prevent run-time error related to Event Setup.\r\n\r\n`Geometry/CSCGeometry/test/stubs/CSCGeometryAnalyzer.cc` -- ES Get Token migration to allow CSC geometry test to run in 12_3.\r\n\r\n`Geometry/GEMGeometry/test/testGEMGeometry_cfg.py`\r\n`Geometry/GEMGeometry/test/testGEMGeometryFromDB_cfg.py`\r\n`Geometry/GEMGeometry/test/testGEMGeometryFromLocalDB_cfg.py` -- scripts to help compare GEM reco geometry in XML, DB, and a local DB.\r\n\r\nNone of the files in this PR are used by any workflow.  They are only used for expert tools.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nDDD DB payloads were created succesfully to verify the changes in this PR. Also, the test scripts were run, and they produce reasonable output.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nA backport to 12_2 would promote consistency but it is not strictly necessary. I can manually copy these changes to a 12_2 working directory if it turns out I need them.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "comments": 6, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1644011888", "deletions": 11, "labels": ["db-pending", "geometry-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 36897, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "open", "title": "Technical fixes for geometry DB payload creation", "updated_at": "1644050093", "user": "cvuosalo"}

Updates to the unpacker (for the test beam last week)\r\n   * Follow up on PR https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/41461.\r\n   * We moved the emulators to more appropriate location (`EventFilter/HGCalRawToDigi`  `SimCalorimetry/HGCalSimAlgos`), they will be subject of a future PR.\r\n1. Updates to the logical mapping & (dense) indexing in `Geometry/HGCalMapping`.\r\n   * Follow up PR https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/43751.\r\n1. The introduction of electronics configuration & calibrations, read from JSONs in `CondFormats`.\r\n   * No need to create special tag for these records yet as this is work in progress.\r\n1. New Alpaka SoA formats for DIGI and RecHits in `DataFormats/HGCalDigi/interface/HGCalDigiSoA.h`.\r\n1. Alpaka calibration kernels for the DIGI  RecHit step.\r\n1. ~Adding `TH2Poly` for DQM.~ Removed from this PR (see [below](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/45665/#issuecomment-2312871831)).\r\n\r\nWe kindly request this to be merged into `CMSSW_14_1_0_pre7` in time for the coming September test beams where validation will continue.\r\n\r\n## PR validation:\r\nNo CMSSW workflow is impacted by this PR.\r\n\r\nWe validated this with test beam data last week.

This involves three old and untested cfg files. They are updated and simplified so they are usable; the `Geometry_cff` load was unnecessary in all of them, so it is removed.\r\n\r\nMerely technical. No changes expected. (These three files are now usable, but they remain untested.)\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nPrivate tests.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

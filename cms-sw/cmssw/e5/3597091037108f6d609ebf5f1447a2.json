This lead to a problem\nwhen the same EDProducer was on a Path and an EndPath. This would cause the\nEDProducer to be removed from the Path but left on the EndPath so the EDProducer\nwould remain scheduled. If modules on a Path needed the results from that\nEDProducer they would fail to get those products.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1460107477", "comments": 10, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1460030575", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["comparison-available", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "177d1d0656b6eb75fd394b06b8a82f2061ea8171", "merged_at": "1460107477", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 13979, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Clean EndPaths as well when going unscheduled", "updated_at": "1463138375", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

Construction of rawPCCProducer that will loop over the modules and count the pixel clusters \r\n2. Harvesters to save reco::PCC object (output from AlcaPCCProducer) and LumiInfo object (output from rawPCCProducer)\r\n\r\nOther collaborators working directly on this project:\r\n@capalmer85 \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 25, "closed_at": "1495184069", "comments": 95, "commits": 22, "created_at": "1491457643", "deletions": 10, "labels": ["alca-pending", "comparison-notrun", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-rejected", "tests-rejected"], "milestone": "CMSSW_9_2_X", "number": 18233, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 58, "state": "closed", "title": "Pixel Cluster Counting Automation", "updated_at": "1495184069", "user": "samhiggie"}

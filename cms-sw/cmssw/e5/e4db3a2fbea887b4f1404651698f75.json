This does not appear to be the case for unique_ptr.\nChanging the code to explicitly look for that case fixed the bug seen.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1461915847", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1461871388", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "generators-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-rejected"], "merge_commit_sha": "6eb471a85e0fb49b71fd1f4ef782d1b05acb5c09", "merged_at": "1461915847", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 14293, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix use of std::unique_ptr in HadronizerFilter", "updated_at": "1461922842", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

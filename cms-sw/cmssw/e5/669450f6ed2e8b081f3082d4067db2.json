Implemented a quick fix so that they are simply removed from the offline tau requirements if they do not exist.\r\nAdded more details to warning messages regarding the non-existence of tau discriminators.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

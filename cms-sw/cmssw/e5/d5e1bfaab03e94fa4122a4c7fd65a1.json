I analyzed the CSC trigger primitives. I determined that there was a minor disagreement between firmware and emulation for the CLCT algorithm. When CCLUT is applied, the deadzone around a CLCT takes into account possible correction of the CLCT half-strip position. This has a particular effect when CLCTs are around 5 half-strips apart from each other. The CCLUT correction on CLCT1 can move them apart (in which case CLCT2 would be kept) or closer together (in which case CLCT2 is eliminated)\r\n   - Previously: 1) find CLCT1, 2) find CLCT2, 3) apply CCLUT to CLCT1, 4) apply CCLUT to CLCT2.\r\n   - Currently: 1) find CLCT1, 2) apply CCLUT to CLCT1, 3) find CLCT2,  4) apply CCLUT to CLCT2.\r\n* Other changes:\r\n   - A `PulseArray` class was introduced, largely to hide the 2D array and some of the trigger logic. This should not change anything.\r\n   - A redundant ghost cancellation function was removed. Only the ghost cancellation function that operates on each wiregroup remains. This is also how it's done in the firmware - in parallel on each wiregroup.\r\n   - A CLCT median timing logic was removed -  we cannot implement this in the OTMB firmware anyway.\r\n   - Pieces of the logic in the findCLCT function or pretrigger function were put in separate functions (`markPreTriggerZone`, `markBusyZone`, `constructCLCT`, `constructPreCLCT`, `clearPreTriggers`) to make it easier to understand and maintain the code.\r\n* Disagreements for ALCTs and CLCTs are now at the same level: about 1 in 17,000 to 20,0000 trigger primitives is off. (Although this is with cosmics.) The CCLUT code calculation is well understood. There is just 1 difference in 119,000 CLCTs. In all, there are just  7 CLCTs different. Those may be worth investigating further. Most likely, there are small differences in other parts of the CLCT algorithm (other than CCLUT).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested so far on the cosmic data. \r\n\r\nResults from short run 10k events:\r\n[CSC_dataVsEmul_B904_Cosmic_Run_210609_142357_ArrangePatFinderAndCCLUT.pdf](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/files/6789029/CSC_dataVsEmul_B904_Cosmic_Run_210609_142357_ArrangePatFinderAndCCLUT.pdf)\r\n\r\nResults from long run 115k events:\r\n[CSC_dataVsEmul_B904_Cosmic_Run_210701_135109.pdf](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/files/6789033/CSC_dataVsEmul_B904_Cosmic_Run_210701_135109.pdf)\r\n\r\nI will test it on 25k Run-2 data events tomorrow and attach the plots (excluding ME+1/1/9, ME+1/1/10, ME+1/1/11).

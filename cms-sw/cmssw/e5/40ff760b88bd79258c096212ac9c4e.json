The input from DIGI step must be produced with DIGIPREMIX_S2:pdigi_valid flag instead of DIGIPREMIX_S2. This guarantees that TrackingParticles for the primary interaction are stored. The code will still run even if it's configured incorrectly, but there won't be any matches.\r\n\r\nThis code is meant to be used with premixed samples since PU mixing information is stored in a different collection and TrackingParticles normally are dropped. For classical pileup mixing the code can be slow.\r\n\r\nMissing parts:\r\n1. Need to find a way to fit it nicely in the reco sequence and to be used only on MC samples\r\n2. Add summary of the matching information to the pat::Muon (trivial part).\r\n\r\nFor details see https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSMUONS-31", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 25, "closed_at": "1508819341", "comments": 312, "commits": 30, "created_at": "1507290929", "deletions": 65, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "operations-pending", "orp-approved", "pdmv-approved", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-pending", "tests-approved", "upgrade-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "2efa972169e003d09c065dc83e1313ee942b45d9", "merged_at": "1508819341", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_4_X", "number": 20773, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 60, "state": "closed", "title": "Muon simhit matching", "updated_at": "1508837508", "user": "drkovalskyi"}

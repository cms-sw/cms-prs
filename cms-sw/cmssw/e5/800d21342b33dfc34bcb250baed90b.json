Keeping said frozen menus in this branch only means extra work to maintain them in `ConfDB` ('migrating' them to newer release 'templates', or modifying them to comply with technical changes in CMSSW, e.g. https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/40215).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

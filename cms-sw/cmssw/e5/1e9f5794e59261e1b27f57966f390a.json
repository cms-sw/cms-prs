This PR will avoid the unit failure when L1T PR (https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/38442) is merged due to removed collection. \r\n\r\nI use this chance also to remove obsolete L1Reco step from Phase2 sequence.\r\n\r\nThe PR test is trigger with #38442 to show that there will be no unit test failure anymore. However, this PR can be merged first (independent of #38442).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nRun locally,\r\n`cmsRun phase2_digi_reco_pixelntuple_cfg.py`\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

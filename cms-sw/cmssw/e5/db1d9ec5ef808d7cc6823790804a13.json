This is due to a problem in Genat4 10.0. In this PR an alternative method enabling muon-nuclear is implemented. Additionally some clean-up of tracking cut in several Physics Lists are done (this is also optional feature). Printouts from PhysicsLists are also improved.\n\nThis PR should not affect mainstream SIM but is useful for neutron background studies. \n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 22, "closed_at": "1433068004", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1432887146", "deletions": 71, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "1a1907cc36a7d8c06f5f78416ef60203efcacfa7", "merged_at": "1433068004", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 9329, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "fixed mu-nuclear", "updated_at": "1433068004", "user": "civanch"}

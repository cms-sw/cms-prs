In ROOT6, it will not work correctly for enums, pointers, or C style arrays, because TypeWithDict does not necessarily have a correct type_info for these types.  The use of this function is replaced by use of the existing hasDictionary() free function, which takes the type_info as its input argument.\nPlease merge this as soon as convenient.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_3_ROOT6_X", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1414074430", "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1414074031", "deletions": 17, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-pending", "core-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "6371d801e9db9a0acdf9728802dc82783fc449e8", "merged_at": "1414074430", "merged_by": "davidlt", "number": 5969, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Remove unneeded function", "updated_at": "1414074758", "user": "wmtan"}

In these cases users have to keep track of the valid data range manually for example by introducing a SCALAR which stores the number of valid elements in the data. \r\n\r\nThis PR adds a method to the View called `setSize` which lets users define a valid datarange. Then `view.metadata().size()` returns the valid data range which can be used to lunch kernels that iterate only the valid data range. Furthermore, the underlying `std::span` s for each coloumn will be the size which was defined by `setSize`\r\n\r\nFYI: @felicepantaleo @leobeltra\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 4, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1761223388", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "heterogeneous-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_0_X", "number": 49204, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Allow users to set a valid data range for the SoA View", "updated_at": "1761224283", "user": "Electricks94"}

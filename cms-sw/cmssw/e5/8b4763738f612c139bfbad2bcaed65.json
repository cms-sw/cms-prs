Probably no one was using this option before now because no one noticed the failure before and there is nothing in the repository referencing it other than a Framework unit test.\r\n\r\nThis bug should not affect anything if that option is not configured. The code fragment with the bug would not be executed.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI added an output module to the unit test so this failure will be detected in the IB if it recurs.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1564605713", "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1564516789", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "d5fa25c79859beb19684ddafd357a0e1e96a933a", "merged_at": "1564605713", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27649, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Bug fix for setRunNumberForEachLumi", "updated_at": "1564605713", "user": "wddgit"}

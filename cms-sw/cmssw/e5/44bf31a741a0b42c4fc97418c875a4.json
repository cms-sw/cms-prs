The side effect is that the output `reco::PFJet`s are produced with [dummy values for what concerns their PF-specific quantities](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/CMSSW_12_6_0_pre2/HLTrigger/JetMET/interface/HLTPFJetsMatchedToFilteredJetsProducer.h#L77) (e.g. PF jet-energy fractions).\r\n\r\n[CMSHLT-2450](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSHLT-2450) highlighted a use case that would profit from having the full information of the input `reco::PFJet`s in the output product [0].\r\n\r\nIn order to so, this PR converts the plugin `HLTPFJetsMatchedToFilteredJetsProducer` to an instantiation of the plugin template `HLTJetsMatchedToFilteredJetsProducer`. With respect to the current version of `HLTPFJetsMatchedToFilteredJetsProducer`, one template argument is added, corresponding to the type of input and output jet collection, thus requiring the two to be equal.\r\n\r\nMeant to be merely technical [1]. Changes are in principle possible [2], but not expected.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\n[0] This use case is not considered critical enough to justify backports of this PR.\r\n\r\n[1] From a technical point of view, this update is fully backward-compatible, and it does not require any change to the HLT configurations.\r\n\r\n[2] The output collection currently holds dummy values, and this PR will change that, filling them properly. If these values are used by anything downstream of these HLT modules (which I don't believe is the case, but I can't be 100% certain), this may lead to differences.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n`addOnTests.py` and `runTheMatrix -l 11634.0` passed.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

This tries to partially address the issue discussed in #39287.\r\n\r\nIf/when non-backward-compatible changes to these data-formats will be needed, one will have to either disable this new unit test, and/or update its EDM input file.\r\n\r\nSmall updates are made to `HLTEventAnalyzer*` to fix an edge case (empty Paths), and reduce duplication of source code. In the case of `HLTEventAnalyzerRAW`, a flag named `permissive` is added to allow bypassing exceptions due to Refs of `triggerEventWithRefs` pointing to unavailable collections.\r\n\r\nDefault behaviour is unchanged, although printouts of `HLTEventAnalyzerAOD` and `HLTEventAnalyzerRAW` are slightly changed.\r\n\r\nMerely technical. No changes expected in the outputs of PR tests.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe new unit test passes. Also checked that the new unit test reports the non-backward-compatible change discussed in #39287 (when using the EDM inputs in the description of that issue).\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported, please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nN/A", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 7, "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1670845864", "deletions": 410, "labels": ["hlt-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "number": 40288, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "add unit test for `TriggerEvent*` analyzers", "updated_at": "1670847746", "user": "missirol"}

If the L3 exists it is saved together with all the L2 muons which did not match with any L3. \r\n- There is the possibility to cut on different variables of the L2 and L3 muons independently.\r\n- There are two different parameters to control the minimum number of L2 and L3 muons that you want to have in order to trigger the event. \r\n- This development has been presented in several Muon POG meetings: [presentation](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1096479/#3-status-of-global-displaced-m).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n- Passed the \"scram b runtests\" test.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1644367482", "comments": 58, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1637773730", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["hlt-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "e984ded5a9757ec5cf887510283bdb91831bc8f6", "merged_at": "1644367482", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 36239, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 116, "state": "closed", "title": "Added new HLTfilter to select L3 and L2 muons", "updated_at": "1644367482", "user": "alexsr-98"}

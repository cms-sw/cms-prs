If the L3 exists it is saved together with all the L2 muons which did not match with any L3. \r\n- There is the possibility to cut on different variables: some of them common for the L2 and L3, and others specific for each type muon. \r\n- This development has been presented in several Muon POG meetings: [presentation](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1096479/#3-status-of-global-displaced-m).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n- Passed the \"scram b runtests\" test.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 26, "commits": 14, "created_at": "1637773730", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["hlt-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-rejected"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 36239, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 77, "state": "open", "title": "Added new HLTfilter to select L3 or L2 muons", "updated_at": "1642160431", "user": "alexsr-98"}

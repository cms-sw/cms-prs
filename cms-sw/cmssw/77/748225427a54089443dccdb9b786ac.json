Iteratively I will check if we can remove/add other wfs. \r\n\r\nI took the chance to a table in the `runTheMatrix.py` README as a form of documentation of what we run. And some comments in `runTheMatrix.py`  itself.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nNone", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 22, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1701273598", "deletions": 49, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "number": 43439, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "open", "title": "Short Matrix Update And Documentation", "updated_at": "1702577746", "user": "AdrianoDee"}

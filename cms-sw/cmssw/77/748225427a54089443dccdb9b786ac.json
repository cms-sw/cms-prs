Iteratively I will check if we can remove/add other wfs. \r\n\r\nI took the chance to a table in the `runTheMatrix.py` README as a form of documentation of what we run. And some comments in `runTheMatrix.py`  itself.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nNone", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1702996154", "comments": 30, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1701273598", "deletions": 49, "labels": ["fully-signed", "tests-approved", "pdmv-approved", "orp-approved", "upgrade-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "f62aeba765beaa5521de0dd4e0e042866b2301d5", "merged_at": "1702996154", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "number": 43439, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "Short Matrix Update And Documentation", "updated_at": "1702996156", "user": "AdrianoDee"}

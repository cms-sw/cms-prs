THIS PR NEEDS an external file I just made the Pull Request in the external : \nhttps://github.com/cms-data/SLHCUpgradeSimulations-Geometry/pull/3\n\nDetails of this geometry were presented in UPS : https://indico.cern.ch/event/563122/contributions/2275415/attachments/1324245/1987214/trackerSim_160817.pdf\n\nSome notes (@kpedro88 , @delaere ) \n- I created a D4 scenario which is a clone of D3, but with the new Tracker (T3) \n- The Numbering in the Pixel disks is fixed thanks to @atricomi\n- warning : I didn't try at this point to change anything with repsect to the ongoing work from @ebrondol about the era migration - I can address this either in this PR or in a subsequent one (this one is already a big chunk of files so ..one thing at a time )\n- The Digitizer algorithm can recognize the simhits depending on the location with Tracker (Pixel /Outer Tracker PS etc.. ) @suchandradutta \n- I have added the WF number 116XX to be tested in IB \n\nI ran also 108, 112 which are not supposed to be affected - seems fine but testing with a PR tests will help -\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 42, "closed_at": "1474015816", "comments": 33, "commits": 37, "created_at": "1472559469", "deletions": 16, "labels": ["comparison-available", "geometry-approved", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 15662, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "Phase2 Tracker Tilted + V4021 Pixels : Geometry and WFs up to Local Reco ", "updated_at": "1474015816", "user": "boudoul"}

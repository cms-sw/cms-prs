Using the reconstructed jets and MET at HLT level, this module produces and saves a collection of cleaned jets which pass the forward-jet cuts. This module will be used in development of several HLT paths, where filtering is done on the missing HT variable computed from the cleaned set of jets. More information about this development and the cleaning cuts applied can be found in [these](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1125473/contributions/4724108/attachments/2391723/4088717/2022-02-15_hlt_exo.pdf) slides. \r\n\r\nThe `HLTHFJetCleaner.h` code is included in the `plugins` sub-directory of `HLTrigger/JetMET` module as templated, and the `SealModule.cc` under `HLTrigger/JetMET` is updated with two related module definitions: One for `reco::CaloJet` and the other for `reco::PFJet`.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe module is tested locally and the following are verified by comparing collections of original AK4 jets and the filtered jets (with version [122331d](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/37539/commits/122331da305e5dbc596d85112a9ad73eb851c6e2)):\r\n\r\n- The module cuts only on the jets that satisfy the `pt`, `eta` and `deltaPhi(jet,MET)` requirements, as specified in the configuration interface of the module.\r\n- The module does not cut on jets if they have a placeholder HF shape variable value (i.e. `-1`).\r\n- The module cuts appropriately on jets that fail the HF variable cuts, as specified in the configuration interface.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 31, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1649772516", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["hlt-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 37539, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 94, "state": "open", "title": "Add HFJetCleaner module for HLT", "updated_at": "1650045606", "user": "alpakpinar"}

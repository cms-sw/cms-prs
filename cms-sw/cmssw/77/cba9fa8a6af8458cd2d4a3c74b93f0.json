Using the reconstructed jets and MET at HLT level, this module produces and saves a collection of cleaned jets which pass the forward-jet cuts. This module will be used in development of several HLT paths, where filtering is done on the missing HT variable computed from the cleaned set of jets. More information about this development and the cleaning cuts applied can be found in [these](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1125473/contributions/4724108/attachments/2391723/4088717/2022-02-15_hlt_exo.pdf) slides. \r\n\r\nThe new `HLTHFJetCleaner.cc` source code is included in the `plugins` sub-directory of `HLTrigger/JetMET` module.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n`runTheMatrix.py` has been successfully run using this version of the code.

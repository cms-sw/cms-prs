This method is not available in the packedGenParticle collection. This PR adds a PackedGenParticleRefVector containing the PackedGenParticles with collisionID =0. It's run for all HI eras; there is no change to pp workflows.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested on 158.01 using as input\r\n/store/himc/HINPbPbAutumn18DR/Bjet_pThat-15_TuneCP5_HydjetDrumMB_5p02TeV_Pythia8/AODSIM/mva98_103X_upgrade2018_realistic_HI_v11-v1/30000/7D8C962E-9A46-9541-94AA-69C01C817F2E.root\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nBackport of #32668 \r\n\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1611161784", "comments": 10, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1611141923", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["backport-ok", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved", "xpog-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "62a58e36859190fdb1c1a827dfe6c9deb748e588", "merged_at": "1611161784", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 32696, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "[11_2_X] Maintain access to genParticles from signal event in packed collection for HI miniAOD ", "updated_at": "1611161785", "user": "mandrenguyen"}

In this PR some optimization is introduced, which is not significant: ~9% for MinBias and ~3% for ttbar. In the default simulation (ZDC is not enabled), no change is expected. Having not a big improvement, this PR is useful, because remove from simulation relatively rare tracks going out of ZDC, further tracking of these tracks has no sense.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nprivate\r\n\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

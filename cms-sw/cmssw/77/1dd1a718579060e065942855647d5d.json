In this PR some optimization is introduced, which is not significant: ~9% for MinBias and ~3% for ttbar. In the default simulation (ZDC is not enabled) no change is expected. Having not a big improvement this PR is useful, because remove relatively rare simulation of tracks outside central detector and outside ZDC, which has no sense.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nprivate\r\n\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

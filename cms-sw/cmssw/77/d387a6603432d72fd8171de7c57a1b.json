Don't want to expand the number of geometries unless necessary.\n- Changed the python printouts to be python comments in case output is piped to a new file, e.g. with edmConfigDump. Arguably these printouts should be removed completely but they can stay for now.\n- Added back a preprocessor conditional to suppress debug output.\n\n@ptraczyk could you check these changes and comment if they're okay?  You can see just my changes to yours at https://github.com/mark-grimes/cmssw/compare/ptraczyk:FastTimingShashlik...mark-grimes:modify6956.\n\nDetails about the original intention of the pull request are on #6956.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "changed_files": 14, "closed_at": "1420560951", "comments": 4, "commits": 14, "created_at": "1420553305", "deletions": 17, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "90f36fc016d090b39b26a44f6ffeb637299c982b", "merged_at": "1420560951", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "number": 7053, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Small changes to #6956 (Fast timing shashlik)", "updated_at": "1422005802", "user": "mark-grimes"}

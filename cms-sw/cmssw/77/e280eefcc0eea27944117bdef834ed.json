Single InputTags have been replaced with vectors of InputTags so that the workers could work both with the old producer and with the new producer introduced in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/36273.\r\n\r\nBy default, the behaviour of the workers is unchanged - the vectors contain only one element. The PCL configs modify these vectors to contain the InputTags required by the new producer as well.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the timing PCLs, the re-reconstruction of the recHits was dropped, and the old producer was modified to supply the recHits directly. It shouldn't cause any change in terms of the produced results.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n- no changes in the relvals (1041, 1042)\r\n- no changes in the results of some local tests\r\n- The multi-InputTag policy works as expected - the PCL workers accept the files produced by the old producer and the files produced by the new producer.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 7, "comments": 2, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1645629769", "deletions": 37, "labels": ["alca-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 37050, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Updated the PPS PCL workers to support the new AlCaRecoProducer", "updated_at": "1645630227", "user": "MatiXOfficial"}

No changes expected.\r\n\r\n(I suspect that something makes 'old' and 'new' check equivalent for virtually all use cases; otherwise, I would not know how this did not cause crashes in the past.)\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

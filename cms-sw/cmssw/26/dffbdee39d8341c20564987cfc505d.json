It allocates the shared_ptr and the pointee in the same allocation.\r\nThis PR changes the very few places in core software that did it the suboptimal way.\r\nNote: make_shared requires that the pointee class has a public constructor. There were two cases where the pointee class had a private constructor, so I did not change those cases.", "branch": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1480179643", "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1480014757", "deletions": 12, "labels": ["comparison-available", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "e4355d436c7a121737d8e1cd6df24cee87e025ed", "merged_at": "1480179643", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "number": 16755, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Use make_shared in core software", "updated_at": "1480303351", "user": "wmtan"}

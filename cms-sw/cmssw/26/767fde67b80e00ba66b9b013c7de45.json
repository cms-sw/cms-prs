It affects only the results of the L1-uGT emulation for AXOL1TL seeds.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nNone beyond the validation done for #49754.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported, please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nTo be backported at least to `CMSSW_16_0_X` for 2026 data-taking purposes (e.g. L1-uGT online DQM). Might also be backported to earlier releases (down to `CMSSW_14_0_X`) to fix the L1T decisions of AXOL1TL seeds in MC.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 4, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1767977395", "deletions": 12, "labels": ["l1-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "bug-fix", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_1_X", "number": 49753, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "L1-uGT emulator: fix to `AXOL1TL`'s \"Pt\" inputs", "updated_at": "1767977689", "user": "missirol"}

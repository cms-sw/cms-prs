For now, the he intent is to preserve the current behaviour.\n\nComparing reco::TrackBase::TrackAlgorithm enumerators with equality on \"magic numbers\" and with less/greater than on anything are, in general, considered harmful. This PR replaces these numbers with enumerators, and the less/greater than comparisons with switches with explicit enumerators. In RecoTracker/FinalTrackSelectors/plugins/*ListMerger.cc an ordering between enumerators is genuinely needed, for them a separate array mapping the enumerators for their order \"priority\" is added (constructed compile-time).\n\nTested in CMSSW_7_5_X_2015-03-09-0200 with 9k events of RelValTTbar. No regression expected, none observed.\n\n@rovere @VinInn @boudoul @venturia \n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 24, "closed_at": "1426937218", "comments": 12, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1426499921", "deletions": 48, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "29a01121541ca75f79b63497e10ac64fdb246e02", "merged_at": "1426937218", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 8315, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "Harmonize the use of reco::TrackBase::TrackAlgorithm enumeration", "updated_at": "1476956229", "user": "makortel"}

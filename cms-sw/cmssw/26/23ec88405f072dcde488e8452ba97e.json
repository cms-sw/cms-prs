For single partition geometries, which will not be used in the Muon TDR, this resulted in a single partition digitization. In order to allow for better default behavior in geometries such as D4 the default is to now use the custom geometry whenever there is a single partition geometry.\r\n\r\nThe \"useBuiltInGeo\" parameter wasn't useful for geometries other than single partition ones. It would return an error if you tried to use it on a multi-partition one. Instead it was replaced with \"useCusGeoFor1PartGeo\" which is only used on single partition geometries. No change in the reconstruction for the default, D12 geometry. \r\n\r\nD4 geometry (1 partition) before this PR:\r\n[hitMap_D4_beforePR.pdf](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/files/911793/hitMap_D4_beforePR.pdf)\r\n\r\nD4 geometry (1 partition) after this PR:\r\n[hitMap_D4_afterPR.pdf](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/files/911795/hitMap_D4_afterPR.pdf)\r\n\r\nD12 geometry (8 partition) before this PR:\r\n[hitMap_D12_beforePR.pdf](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/files/911796/hitMap_D12_beforePR.pdf)\r\n\r\nD12 geometry (8 partition) after this PR:\r\n[hitMap_D12_afterPR.pdf](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/files/911798/hitMap_D12_afterPR.pdf)\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a displacement in local (chamber) coordinates between D4 and D12. This is due tot he placement of the eta partitions within the D4 geo. It doesn't affect segment reconstruction as it is simply a uniform displacement in Y.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1492015282", "comments": 16, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1491863691", "deletions": 11, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "919db20381f2e16573798a4330d943facb502a1f", "merged_at": "1492015282", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_1_X", "number": 18302, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "By default digitize single partition ME0 geometry with custom parameters", "updated_at": "1492015282", "user": "nickmccoll"}

Timing improvement in a standalone test of KDTreeLinkerAlgo::recSearch() was roughly 40 %. In CMSSW at very high pileup (140) the timing of seeding (SeedGeneratorFromRegionHitsEDProducer::produce()) improved by roughly 3 %.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1380107648", "comments": 14, "commits": 11, "created_at": "1378874140", "deletions": 211, "labels": ["fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "1fc69ceb77bbf2d87d3a81adc6fa5fda7125905b", "merged_at": "1380107648", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_0_0_pre5", "number": 772, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "Performance improvement in KDTreeLinkerAlgo<T> ", "updated_at": "1476951322", "user": "makortel"}

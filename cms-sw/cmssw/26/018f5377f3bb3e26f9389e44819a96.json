Should help with speed. If there is incidental slow down compared to yesterday's IB I will remove it.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1465711006", "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1465574072", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "41e732fe34ca083f74c5d03066e828ad6af00f34", "merged_at": "1465711006", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 14844, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Bugfix: Ensure by force that the deepest root of the connected graph is always found in PFBA", "updated_at": "1465711006", "user": "lgray"}

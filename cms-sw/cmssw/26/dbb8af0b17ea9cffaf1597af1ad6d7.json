For some reason it was checking the size() of the rechit to see if it is a hit (size ==1) or segment (size>1). And it failed for 4d segments that have only one phi/theta projection - then size()==1 and the code thinks it is a segment. So I changed this to checking the hit dimension which makes much more sense.\r\n\r\nFYI @ptraczyk ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1520000053", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["code-checks-pending", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_1_X", "number": 22422, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "bug fix for high pt muon algorithm (\"Picky\")", "updated_at": "1520000076", "user": "drkovalskyi"}

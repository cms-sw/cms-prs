For some reason it was checking the size() of the rechit to see if it is a hit (size ==1) or segment (size>1). And it failed for 4d segments that have only one phi/theta projection - then size()==1 and the code thinks it is a segment. So I changed this to checking the hit dimension which makes much more sense.\r\n\r\nFYI @ptraczyk ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1520863353", "comments": 14, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1520000053", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "0a3c5585dcc44fcf50c50a5a1c6acbda558c0d42", "merged_at": "1520863353", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_1_X", "number": 22422, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "[muon id] bug fix for high pt muon algorithm (\"Picky\")", "updated_at": "1520863354", "user": "drkovalskyi"}

This PR and #47504 provide the same functionality:\r\n\r\n> Specialise `Handle` and `OrphanHandle` for `WrapperBase`: this lets users produce and consume collections via their wrapper, using their run time type information (_e.g._ type name, type id, ...) instead of the compile time types. Implement integration test for these specialisations.\r\n> \r\n> Introduce a `TrivialCopyTraits` structure, that should be specialised for types that can be safely `memcpy`ed, without requiring a full ROOT streamer de/serialisation. Specialise the `TrivialCopyTraits` for arithmetic types and `vector`s of arithmetic types, and all `PortableObject` and `PortableCollection` types.\r\n> \r\n> Implement `edmtest::GenericCloner`: this `EDProducer` will consume and clone all the event products declared by its configuration; a direct `memcpy` will be used for types that support the `TrivialCopyTraits` interface; the ROOT dictionaries will be used to serialise and deserialise the other types.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe plugin factory returns `TrivialSerialiserSource` objects for a given type. `TrivialSerialiser`s can then be initialized by calling `TrivialSerialiserSource::initialize` with a `WrapperBase` object. The initialized TrivialSerialiser is `const` or non `const` depending on the constness of the `WrapperBase` object used to initialize it. A pointer to this `WrapperBase` object is stored in `TrivialSerialiserBase` as `const edm::WrapperBase*`.\r\n\r\nSome member functions of TrivialSerialiser involve writing into the wrapper and thus are not marked const.\r\n\r\n- `TrivialSerialiser<T>::trivialCopyInitialize`, which may allocate memory in the wrapped object (e.g. `resize` a vector) in preparation for receiving data into this object.\r\n- The non-const overload of `TrivialSerialiser<T>::trivialCopyRegions()`, which returns the memory regions to which memory will be copied.\r\n\r\nThese methods cannot be called on a `const` serialiser. When called on a non-const serialiser, `const_cast` is used to retrieve the originally non-const `WrapperBase`, which at initialization was stored as `const`.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nUnit tests (`src/FWCore/TestModules/test/testGenericCloner_cfg.py`) pass.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

There's a comment on #7823 explaining where this can happen.  I have no idea how likely the condition is to be met, but safer not to introduce any potential for a memory leak.\n\nChanging the `hits` vector to an `edm::OwnVector` would have been a more \"CMSSW friendly\" solution, but that would have required changing the class interface since the vector is passed around.\n\n@sviret, let me know if you're happy with this solution. You should be able to see just my changes at https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/commit/7463d3051813ad19d742ccd04f77c7c4c2e5c0e3.\n\n(EDIT - that link for the commit with my changes isn't working for some reason. No idea why.)\n", "branch": "CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "changed_files": 16, "closed_at": "1425941369", "comments": 7, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1425407949", "deletions": 38, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-pending", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "8f0acea24526327a169facadd5efe9f1e65dbbea", "merged_at": "1425941369", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "number": 8046, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Small fix to PR #7823 (Adding the retina fitter)", "updated_at": "1426005998", "user": "mark-grimes"}

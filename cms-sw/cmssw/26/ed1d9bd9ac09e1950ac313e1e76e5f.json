When that effort is complete, the intent is to submit a separate PR deleting that ParameterSet when all module construction is complete.\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses modules in the DQM subsystems with such a reference.\r\n\r\nThese references were not needed. I just deleted them. They were either not used at all or used only in the constructor and not needed because the constructor already has a reference as an argument.\r\n\r\nThere is more information in Issue #42503.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRelies on existing tests.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "comments": 0, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1692037074", "deletions": 10, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending", "trk"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_3_X", "number": 42567, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Remove references to main ParameterSet in DQM subsystems", "updated_at": "1692037095", "user": "wddgit"}

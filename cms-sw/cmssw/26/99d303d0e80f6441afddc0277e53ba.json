The problem was that `matRinv` is defined as a 22 matrix:\r\nhttps://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/CMSSW_14_0_0/L1Trigger/TrackFindingTMTT/src/KFbase.cc#L549\r\nwhile `unitMatrix` is defined as a 55 matrix (`nHelixPar_` is five when running the extended tracking):\r\nhttps://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/CMSSW_14_0_0/L1Trigger/TrackFindingTMTT/src/KFbase.cc#L554\r\n\r\nSo then there is an exception caused by assigning one to the other on this line:\r\nhttps://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/CMSSW_14_0_0/L1Trigger/TrackFindingTMTT/src/KFbase.cc#L556\r\nHence the error message:\r\n```\r\n\r\n[a] Fatal Root Error: @SUB=operator=(const TMatrixT &)\r\nmatrices not compatible\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nA recipe for reproducing the exception can be found in #44306.

In this way the reordering of BTL modules, added to that PR to minimize the number of updates of references, is undone as well, leaving a function ```makempiToppi```, used in preprocessor blocks for debugging, not defined. \r\n\r\nWhile this has no impact in normal code operation, it introduces a static CLANG analyzer error. This PR fixes the problem, without activating the change of order.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles, runs, unit test for the package passes, ```scram b checker``` does not show any more the CLANG error reported by the IB.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1737390496", "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1737366867", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["geometry-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "bug-fix", "orp-approved", "upgrade-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "8be0c5decccfccc5111c9028ba5213fc42572ef8", "merged_at": "1737390496", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_15_0_X", "number": 47143, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "MTD geometry: address static CLANG analyzer error in Geometry/MTDNumberingBuilder", "updated_at": "1737390497", "user": "fabiocos"}

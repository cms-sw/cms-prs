Allows us the option to treat the top quark as the recoiler during gluon emission in t -> bW decay. Expect to see differences between recoilToTop and the current recoilToColoured options, particularly in B hadron sensitive variables. PR includes header file containing actual function, as well as edits to existing files Pythia8Hadronizer.cc and Py8Interface.cc to incorporate said changes. Python config file to easily run and test recoilToTop is included.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCompiles properly using `scram b -j 8`. Private samples generated with careful analysis conducted in Rivet to compare between the different recoiler options. No issues in using each of the options when running CMSSW. Only validated on CMSSW_13_2_0_pre1.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1688038545", "comments": 3, "commits": 8, "created_at": "1688033398", "deletions": 24, "labels": ["generators-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-rejected"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_2_X", "number": 42136, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Integration of TopRecoilHook ", "updated_at": "1688038545", "user": "vslokenb"}

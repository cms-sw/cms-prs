I was considering implementing = fillDescriptions()= but since this filter does not inherit from =EDFilter= this method would not be used as far as I understood.\r\n\r\n(mentioning @pgrash since he may be interested in seeing how this pull request progresses).", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 1, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1538135124", "deletions": 65, "labels": ["code-checks-pending", "comparison-pending", "generators-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_3_X", "number": 24754, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "made double em enrichment filter parameters tracked", "updated_at": "1538135153", "user": "andreh7"}

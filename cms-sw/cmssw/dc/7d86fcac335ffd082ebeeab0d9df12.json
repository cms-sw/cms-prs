I was considering implementing = fillDescriptions()= but since this filter does not inherit from =EDFilter= this method would not be used as far as I understood.\r\n\r\n(mentioning @pgrash since he may be interested in seeing how this pull request progresses).", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1539236421", "comments": 14, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1538135124", "deletions": 65, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "generators-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "f559cdf2d72128b131e549f8e500a6e240510459", "merged_at": "1539236421", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_4_X", "number": 24754, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "made double em enrichment filter parameters tracked", "updated_at": "1539236421", "user": "andreh7"}

This means someone can get a menu and add the following two lines to the end of it to switch on the New L3 algorithms:\nfrom newL3 import addL3ToHLT\nprocess = addL3ToHLT(process)\n\nhltTestNewL3.py is simply a frozen 25ns menu dumped with a selection of interesting muon paths to look at along with the two lines mentioned above at the end of it.\n\nThis means someone could either get a menu and customise it with the customiser file (newL3.py) or simply run the stand alone menu.\n\n[1] https://indico.cern.ch/event/402284/\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1442320613", "comments": 26, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1441786282", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "9b6e4c445b7ce2e32a8d19699ad0d2b94c6f047d", "merged_at": "1442320613", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 11200, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Adding test configuration files for New L3 Algorithms", "updated_at": "1442320613", "user": "BenjaminRS"}

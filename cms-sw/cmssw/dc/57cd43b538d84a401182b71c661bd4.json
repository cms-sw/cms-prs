Consistent test results will be one way to validate that the DD4hep units change is working correctly.\r\n\r\nThe test from `DetectorDescription/DDCMS/plugins/test/DDTestSpecParsFilter.cc` outputs `TrackerXi` and `TrackerRadLength`. These values are defined in XML as plain numbers without units. Thus, it is not necessary to convert their units, and so the unit conversion in the output of these two values is removed by this PR.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe unit test results and debug output from these files was checked before and after the PR. They are the same, except for the above-mentioned removal of conversion of `TrackerXi` and `TrackerRadLength` and for the addition (for clarity) of \"cm\" in the output of the `DDSolid` units test.\r\n\r\nThe decision of whether to backport this PR to 11_2 will be made later.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1608193355", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1608129956", "deletions": 68, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "a88d90657c3b3acbf2726c5dd6edadd2a51718b0", "merged_at": "1608193355", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 32509, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 4, "state": "closed", "title": "[DD4hep] Ensure DDCMS test results stay same with DD4hep units change", "updated_at": "1608193355", "user": "cvuosalo"}

In this PR the energy threshold for the fatal exception is increased from 100 MeV to 1.5 GeV. This will reduce number of exceptions for Heavy Ion simulations with this version of production. This threshold means that the particle with energy below this threshold will be killed and the fatal exception will not be issued.\r\n\r\nWe will work on understanding of the problem in the master, the final fix may be different \r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nprivate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_13_0_HeavyIon_X", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1738602748", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["simulation-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started"], "number": 47251, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[SIM Bug] Protection against geometry exceptions for HI simulations", "updated_at": "1738603171", "user": "civanch"}

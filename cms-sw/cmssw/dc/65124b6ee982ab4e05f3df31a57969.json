The PR can not able to merge but this is not due to my code. In the 9_3_X can be merged and compile/run without problems. I did not change any line in the code and addressed the comments of @davidlange6 . I suppose that master branch is something else than 9_3_X because i see many changed files, while i only used 5.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 106, "closed_at": "1506004350", "comments": 7, "commits": 52, "created_at": "1505660650", "deletions": 38405, "labels": ["alca-rejected", "analysis-pending", "code-checks-rejected", "comparison-pending", "core-pending", "dqm-pending", "generators-pending", "hlt-rejected", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-rejected", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending", "upgrade-rejected"], "milestone": "CMSSW_9_4_X", "number": 20551, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Cmssw mstr brn", "updated_at": "1506004350", "user": "gkaratha"}

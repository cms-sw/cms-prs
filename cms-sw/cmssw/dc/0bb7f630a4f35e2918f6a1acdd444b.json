The \"old\" status plot is now only used for the LG PCL alignment.\r\nIn detail the following changes have been made:\r\n\r\n- Add a map to `MillePedeFileReader` to store the threshold decision per structure and direction. Introduce a method to get the map.\r\n- In `MillePedeDQMModule` different versions status plot depending on the alignment granularity (LG or HG) are produced.\r\n\r\nAn example of the customized status plot is shown below. Here, the fraction threshold is exceeded for three different detector-direction combinations and the alignment would be updated. The DQM GUI render plugin will be updated to cope with the \"new\" status plot.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32901048/178692141-a94438a1-5152-488e-a9bc-e8d37a78db6d.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nThe PR can be validated using `runTheMatrix.py -l 1001.2 --ibeos`.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

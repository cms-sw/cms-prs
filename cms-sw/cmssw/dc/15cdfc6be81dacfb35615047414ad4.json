PR #34618.\r\nRejecting large clusters allows for a significant reduction of fake tracks, with ~ zero change in efficiency.\r\n\r\n### PR validation:\r\nTTbar + PU: http://uaf-10.t2.ucsd.edu/~mmasciov/MIC/maxClusterSize/MTV_TTbarPU50_maxClusterSize7_fakeHitIdx-5\r\nHigh-pT (1800-2400 GeV) QCD + PU: http://uaf-10.t2.ucsd.edu/~mmasciov/MIC/maxClusterSize/MTV_highPtQCD_wPU_maxClusterSize7_fakeHitIdx-5\r\n\r\nNote that the performance in high-pT QCD MC was also evaluated following a report at one past TRK POG meeting, and no regression is visible (see comparisons above).\r\n\r\n### Additional notes:\r\nThis PR will need a `git rebase` after #37581 and #37586; however, I'm opening it already in favor of starting its review already, since the review will be independent of the rebase.\r\n\r\nFYI @mmusich @vmariani \r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "comments": 25, "commits": 11, "created_at": "1650464739", "deletions": 34, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "tracking-pog-pending", "tracking"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 37635, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Add configurable cut on SiStrip max cluster cut (by default <8) in mkFit tracking iterations", "updated_at": "1651053164", "user": "mmasciov"}

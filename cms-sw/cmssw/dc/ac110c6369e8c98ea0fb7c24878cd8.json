The specifications have been agreed upon by the track trigger and the L1Trigger project leads. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nAfter forming a branch with just the changes we want (see backport specifications for more details), the ability to compile the code was checked by doing:\r\n```bash\r\ncmsrel CMSSW_12_0_X_2021-07-19-1100\r\ncd CMSSW_12_0_X_2021-07-19-1100/src\r\ncmsenv\r\ngit-cms-init\r\ngit-cms-checkout-topic aperloff:CMSSW_12_0_X-TrackWordUpdate\r\nscram b -j 8\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also re-ran the code checks and code format checks using:\r\n```bash\r\nscram build code-checks\r\nscram build code-format\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo confirm that the code runs I used:\r\n```bash\r\nscram b runtests\r\nrunTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nThese changes were previously integrated into the cms-l1t-offline fork of CMSSW and are being ported over to this repo. This PR includes portions of https://github.com/cms-l1t-offline/cmssw/pull/896 and https://github.com/cms-l1t-offline/cmssw/pull/902. The backport was created manually due to the complexity of the Git history in cms-l1t-offline.\r\n\r\n@tomalin @skinnari @emacdonald16 @rekovic @cecilecaillol", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 8, "closed_at": "1627456778", "comments": 32, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1626703476", "deletions": 611, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "hlt-approved", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "075121fd54a5b5caed4c66024ff3268240887b8f", "merged_at": "1627456778", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "number": 34550, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Update the TTTrack_TrackWord DataFormat", "updated_at": "1627456779", "user": "aperloff"}

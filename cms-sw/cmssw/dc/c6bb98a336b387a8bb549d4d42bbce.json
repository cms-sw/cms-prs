While, for Run3 nanoAOD, we are storing also HZZ mva scores. This is causing inconsistency between the mini and nano AODs. The main problem is that if any analysis team wants to use HZZ ID in Run3 but with a different cut, can't do that in miniAOD but only in nanoAOD. \r\nThis PR solves that discrepancy. We have plan to retrain HZZ electron mva ID using Run3 samples, but it will take time to converge. Until then the Run2 UL HZZ ID is good enough to be used.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n- Tested with `runTheMatrix.py -l 12434.0 ` and verified that the new variable is added correctly\r\n\r\n@swagata87 pls follow\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1668084964", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "egamma"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_6_X", "number": 40039, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Adding HZZ electron ID mva score to miniAOD for Run3", "updated_at": "1668165924", "user": "asculac"}

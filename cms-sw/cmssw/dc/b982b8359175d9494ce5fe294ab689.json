The intent was to try to find the preferred module labels and if it can't then keep a data product if there is only one choice. The algorithm now does that behavior.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRunning #38603 showed that the histograms generated by using this as a filter were filled differently based on the order in which this code saw data products. Now with or without #38603 the same data products are chosen.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1659120902", "deletions": 250, "labels": ["l1-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 38900, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Fix L1GtUtilsHelper's search for data products to consume", "updated_at": "1659352320", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

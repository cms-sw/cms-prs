Apparently, given no checks for finiteness,  a perp computed on a 3D vector of NaN values looks like a zero.\r\n\r\nI'm proposing a simple fix to return one of the identical points.\r\n\r\nI'm adding a warning only because this condition was previously leading to a (caught) exception.\r\n\r\n(~Also, I'm not familiar enough with `GhostTrackVertexFinder` to conclude that an averaging with self is an indication of a logic error and that a fix upstream is needed.~)\r\nAfter some tests in relvals, the conditions seems to happen in ` O(1e-3)` events.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1646395295", "comments": 17, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1646058527", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "35036ab5239ce3a121ab47633f625cd289f10976", "merged_at": "1646395295", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 37088, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "properly treat averaging with self in GhostTrackVertexFinder::vtxMean", "updated_at": "1646395295", "user": "slava77"}

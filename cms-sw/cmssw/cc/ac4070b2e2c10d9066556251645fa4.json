Those flags are not used anymore, so we would need to drop this condition.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAndrea. \r\n\r\nFYI, @smuzaffar", "branch": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1677585745", "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1677568987", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["core-approved", "simulation-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "backport-ok"], "merge_commit_sha": "f26a0f288d414c5dd7c070335f445fd99e38dba4", "merged_at": "1677585745", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "number": 40892, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Drop unused lto flags in `BigProducts/Simulation` BuildFile", "updated_at": "1677587749", "user": "cmsbuild"}

Those flags are not used anymore, so we would need to drop this condition.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAndrea. \r\n\r\nFYI, @smuzaffar", "branch": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1677568987", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["simulation-pending", "core-approved", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "backport-ok"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "number": 40892, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Drop unused lto flags in `BigProducts/Simulation` BuildFile", "updated_at": "1677569221", "user": "cmsbuild"}

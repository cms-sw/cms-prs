At the same time, the part of the validation classes that still allowed for a one-disk geometry, no more present in the release since a while, is removed.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles and run. Debugging statements have been actively used, but are not visible with the default ```MessageLogger``` settings.

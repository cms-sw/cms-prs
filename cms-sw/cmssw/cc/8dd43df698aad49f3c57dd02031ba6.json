The OOT PU corrections in Run1 GT being different than Run2 is not an issue: they were consumed by Method 1 (while method 2 does not require any new condition input), so they are now deprecated. As soon as method 1 will be dismissed, we will remove them: so please keep us informed about this change.\nSee the discussion in #6642 for more details\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1418202408", "comments": 6, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1418137269", "deletions": 8, "labels": ["alca-approved", "comparison-pending", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "214e4c49a7b06d1b047be87ec929ca2d611edbe3", "merged_at": "1418202408", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 6846, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "New Run1 simulation GT for HCAL response corrections.", "updated_at": "1418204566", "user": "diguida"}

The order is the one of run2 tracking, but phase1 and phase2 tracking have the iterations in different orders. This PR proposes to make this iteration ordering dynamic via ESProduct `TrackAlgoPriorityOrder` that is configured via tracking eras using `iterativeTkConfig.py`. The `TrackAlgoPriorityOrder` starts with the hardcoded order, and reorders only the algos that are given as parameters.\r\n\r\nTested in CMSSW_9_1_X_2017-03-02-2300. There can be tiny changes in non-run2-tracking in cases the \"best algo\" gets changed by this reordering and the other track has slightly different parameters. Anything else (run2 tracking, HLT) should have no changes. (and all changes should be caused by the second commit alone, the first one being purely technical)\r\n\r\n@rovere @VinInn ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 41, "closed_at": "1489211190", "comments": 19, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1488560214", "deletions": 24, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fastsim-pending", "hlt-approved", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "22f15e6380bd81740386801a62cdbc2463658410", "merged_at": "1489211190", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_1_X", "number": 17771, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "Make track algo priority order dynamic", "updated_at": "1489211190", "user": "makortel"}

The resulting line looks like:\n\n```\n<Metric Name=\"cpusetCount\" Value=\"1\"/>\n```\n\nWith this, we hope that experts are more likely to notice that the\ncpuset is different from expectations\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1473308320", "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1473254693", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["comparison-available", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "e611e01bde0161f40ff99dc6793c1458060c06a2", "merged_at": "1473308320", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 15760, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add cpuset size information to the FJR.", "updated_at": "1473308321", "user": "bbockelm"}

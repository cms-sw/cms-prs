The problem was that the SwitchProducer-EDAlias' alias-for `BranchID` was not inserted into the `trueBranchIDToKeptBranchDesc`, and therefore the check threw an exception only if the non-SwitchProducer-EDAlias duplicate entry was earlier in the map. This PR fixes the check to use the proper alias-for `BranchID` for both normal and SwitchProducer EDAliases.\r\n\r\nThe first commit consolidates some of the SwitchProducer unit test configuration files to reduce copy paste.\r\n\r\nResolves #40110\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nFramework unit tests run. The example HLT configuration throws now the proper exception.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1669698690", "comments": 18, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1669166682", "deletions": 181, "labels": ["core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "830c070592d91b7799eb39e1a3a15b232052ab61", "merged_at": "1669698690", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "number": 40136, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Make duplicate branch check work properly with SwitchProducer that has EDAlias case", "updated_at": "1669698691", "user": "makortel"}

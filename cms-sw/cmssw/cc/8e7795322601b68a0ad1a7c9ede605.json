The problem was that the SwitchProducer-EDAlias' alias-for `BranchID` was not inserted into the `trueBranchIDToKeptBranchDesc`, and therefore the check threw an exception only if the non-SwitchProducer-EDAlias duplicate entry was earlier in the map. This PR fixes the check to use the proper alias-for `BranchID` for both normal and SwitchProducer EDAliases.\r\n\r\nThe first commit consolidates some of the SwitchProducer unit test configuration files to reduce copy paste.\r\n\r\nResolves #40110\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nFramework unit tests run. The example HLT configuration throws now the proper exception.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "comments": 3, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1669166682", "deletions": 181, "labels": ["core-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_6_X", "number": 40136, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Make duplicate branch check work properly with SwitchProducer that has EDAlias case", "updated_at": "1669167752", "user": "makortel"}

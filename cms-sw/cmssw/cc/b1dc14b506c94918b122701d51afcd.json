Now the CPE is imported from external package as all the other CPEs. This PR is purely technical, no changes are expected for phase2 (comparison for 100 ttbar events in tilted geom can be found [here](http://ebrondol.web.cern.ch/ebrondol/Phase2Tracking/CPE/MTV_TTbar_14TeV_tilt_CPE_3/plots_summary/summary.pdf)).

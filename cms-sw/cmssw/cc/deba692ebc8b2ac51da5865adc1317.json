This is the main content of this PR (99%). Changed also some test configurations in Pythia8Interface/test, used by very limited number of people, intended to see the difference of tauola tau decays from pythia8 tau decays. They will be needed for further tests (essentially technical, without physics).", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1637011528", "comments": 28, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1634366173", "deletions": 62, "labels": ["generators-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "40468b19506ba40206a4dcf7183448b85ac7c04d", "merged_at": "1637011528", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_2_X", "number": 35700, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "preparing to HepMC3", "updated_at": "1637011528", "user": "mkirsano"}

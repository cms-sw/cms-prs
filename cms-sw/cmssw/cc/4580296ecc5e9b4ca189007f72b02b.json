The problem in CMSSW was that the\nfirst argument was neither Int_t nor Float_t. It all 4 places it was\nunsinged int. According to the compiler both TColor ctors are valid, it\ncan call either of them.\n\nWe have to be more explicit that we want the first ctor. Thus cast the\nfirst argument to Int_t to match the first ctor signature.\n\nThis does not change behaviour, that was previously done by the compiler.\n\nSigned-off-by: David Abdurachmanov David.Abdurachmanov@cern.ch\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1455775686", "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1455775281", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-approved", "visualization-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "a25d77589711f96fdfd05078245b28055687c99d", "merged_at": "1455775686", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 13335, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Resolve ambiguity with TColor ctors", "updated_at": "1455782566", "user": "davidlt"}

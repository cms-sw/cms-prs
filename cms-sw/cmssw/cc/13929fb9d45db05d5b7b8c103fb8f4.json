Well, I couldn't find any and I don't think it's even possible because the HIPhotonIsolation is a custom class. Hence, we can't use the existing mechanisms for `int` and `float` ValueMaps.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, this PR proposes the solution via editing the ReducedEGProducer source.\r\n\r\n@mandrenguyen @ttrk \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCMSSW compiles, local matrix tests pass.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nThis is a backport of PR https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/32462, which is backported to 11_2_X because this is the release for HI MiniAOD production.", "branch": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1610579466", "comments": 12, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1610114789", "deletions": 51, "labels": ["backport-ok", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "79d7b74e1c56042ae3ce0789f3cf58f1e5a0b2a4", "merged_at": "1610579466", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 32619, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "[11_2_X] Correctly add HIPhotonIsolation to pat::photon", "updated_at": "1610579467", "user": "guitargeek"}

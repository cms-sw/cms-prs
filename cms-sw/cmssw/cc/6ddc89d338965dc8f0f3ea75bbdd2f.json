Open to discussion.\r\n\r\nComplimentary PR to dmwm/deployment:\r\n- https://github.com/dmwm/deployment/pull/1155\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nOnline DQM client run on test data. Offline DQM tested on relval WF 11634.511 (`runTheMatrix.py -w upgrade -l 11634.511`). In both cases, the new plots were created successfully and matched the features of the old plots.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

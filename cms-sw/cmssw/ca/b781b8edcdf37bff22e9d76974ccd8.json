The errors were caused by a merge from 7_5_X in which a class with a dictionary acquired undefined member functions, which is harmless in C++ and ROOT6, but in ROOT 5 causes the generated dictionary  to fail to compile.\nThis PR simply comments out the declarations of the undefined functions.\nPlease expedite this purely technical PR.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_ROOT5_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1436468603", "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1435677463", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-rejected"], "number": 9976, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Comment out undefined functions to fix build errors", "updated_at": "1436468620", "user": "wmtan"}

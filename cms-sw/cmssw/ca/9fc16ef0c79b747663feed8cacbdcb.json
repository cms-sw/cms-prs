The tool adds the capability of performing now trends of position estimators when doing tracker geometry comparisons, which integrates to the already existing trend tools for the other internal validation procedures performed in TrkAl.\r\n\r\nThe changes consist in the following:\r\n  -  addition of main code corresponding to GCPtrend tool\r\n  -  minor modification in Trend library to avoid large print out\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTests of the tool have been performed by both the author and another member of the TrkAl team.\r\n\r\n@consuegs , @connorpa , @henriettepetersen, @antoniovagnerini, @mmusich \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 766, "comments": 17, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1671127938", "deletions": 187717, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "dqm-pending", "l1-pending", "hlt-pending", "core-pending", "analysis-pending", "alca-pending", "daq-pending", "fastsim-pending", "db-pending", "generators-pending", "geometry-pending", "operations-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-pending", "xpog-pending", "heterogeneous-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "number": 40336, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 9, "state": "open", "title": "Adding new GCP trends tool and commenting unnecessary print out in Trend", "updated_at": "1673886449", "user": "perezdanyer"}

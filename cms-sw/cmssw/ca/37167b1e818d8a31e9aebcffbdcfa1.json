The problem happens because in this run geometry was created twice. The fix is done in two places: \r\n1) inside SiPixelLorentzAnglePCLHarvester value of the magnetic field is accessed just after access to the EventSetup and stored in local class member. Likely this change has no effect but logically is more safe.\r\n2) inside DD4hep_VolumeBasedMagneticFieldESProducerFromDB  a new class member added - pointer to geometry. Added a check, which guaranteed that the geometry is created only once. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

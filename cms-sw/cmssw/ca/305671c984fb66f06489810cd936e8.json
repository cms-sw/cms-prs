The PR just adds the functionality to select a different (generic) quantity as PU proxy, adding a switch (`usePUProxyValue`) and an `InputTag` to a `double` in the event. Some internal functions are renamed accordingly for clarity.\r\n\r\nThis small update is currently used in Phase-2 HLT-TDR studies, and the intention is to backport it to `11_1_X`.\r\n\r\nDefaults are unchanged, so no changes are expected in the comparisons.\r\n\r\nFYI: @lathomas @kirschen @fwyzard @trtomei @pallabidas\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nVerified in HLT-TDR studies that the updated code behaves as expected.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\n#32341\r\n\r\nBackport needed for Phase-2 HLT-TDR studies in `11_1_X`.", "branch": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1607763433", "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1607536561", "deletions": 12, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "backport-ok", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "f0be962ee760ee258c8cb6b90755fe6e0e4bd0a1", "merged_at": "1607763433", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 32434, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "[11_1_X] [Puppi] option to use generic PU proxy", "updated_at": "1607763434", "user": "missirol"}

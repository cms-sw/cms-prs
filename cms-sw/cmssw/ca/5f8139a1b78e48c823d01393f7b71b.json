The second is that for types where the ROOT6 normalized name is a typedef (e.g Ulong64_t), an infinite regression could occur while attempting to remove typedefs.  This pull request also removes an obsolete comment.\nPlease merge this pull request in a timely manner.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_2_ROOT6_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1406612495", "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1406579828", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "600fd500143a3718abe4add7badb1364adeb292e", "merged_at": "1406612495", "merged_by": "davidlt", "number": 4810, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix handling of references and typedefs", "updated_at": "1406826226", "user": "wmtan"}

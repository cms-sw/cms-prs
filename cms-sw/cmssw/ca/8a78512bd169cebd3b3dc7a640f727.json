As expected, the results obtained using struct was exactly the same as using vectors, even in the case of MiniAOD size. The results can be found in this set of slides (from previous PR):\r\n\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/susuzaanbk3jb3h/HIHFFilter.pdf?dl=0\r\n\r\nThe studies above was made in 103X, and was also tested in 112X using \"runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos\", in special workflow 159. The versions 103X and 112X returns exactly the same results on the tests. On this new version I have checked in the exactly the same way on 112X.\r\n\r\n@mandrenguyen  @pjwinnetou @FHead \r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nDener Lemos\r\n\r\nSummarizing the request: \r\n\r\nThis PR is made to include the HF event filters in the Heavy Ions miniAOD workflow. This is expected to be included only for the eras \"pp_on_AA_2018\" and \"pp_on_PbPb_run3\". Since the towerMaker collection is not saved in miniAOD this filters need be stored in the miniAOD content. To include that filters, a EDProducer was created to run on PAT and store a struct with 4 integers which each of them has the minimum number of towers above some threshold between the two HF sides (std::min(nTowerHF+,nTowerHF-)), which means:\r\n\r\nnumMinHFTowers2 = N of minimum HF towers above 2 GeV\r\nnumMinHFTowers3 = N of minimum HF towers above 3 GeV\r\nnumMinHFTowers4 = N of minimum HF towers above 4 GeV\r\nnumMinHFTowers5 = N of minimum HF towers above 5 GeV", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": "1602196058", "comments": 55, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1601240380", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "d7632eb9eac411f09a21541825ea0bc958c59259", "merged_at": "1602196057", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 31602, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 35, "state": "closed", "title": "Include the HF filters used in heavy ions using struct in the MiniAOD content", "updated_at": "1602196058", "user": "denerslemos"}

In addition, the particles are shooted in random (phi,R) windows. Now in the configuration file the number of particles should be set, along with a boolean parameter (RandomShoot) which will be used in the producer to select either that number of particles or a random one in the range 1 - NParticles+1.\r\nIn addition, the working snippet in the Generators folder has been modified properly.\r\n\r\n@rovere \r\n@felicepantaleo ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1557340216", "comments": 31, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1556187457", "deletions": 9, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "generators-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "5280726bd8b52b3cbbbd343db4ab6225d5b13d1e", "merged_at": "1557340216", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 26531, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "Added random particles to CloseByParticleGun generator", "updated_at": "1557340216", "user": "tonydp03"}

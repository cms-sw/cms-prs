A collection of tau decay products is created on the fly and then stored in a new NanoAOD table. Additional information stored is as follows for each candidate in the table:\r\n\r\n- 3-momenta\r\n- PDG ID\r\n- Index of its mother tau\r\n\r\nSize tests have been conducted to assess the size increase on NanoAOD. These tests have been conducted using two RelVal samples:\r\n\r\n- TTBar (/w PU)\r\n- ZTT\r\n\r\nThe cumulative contribution of the tau decay products in NanoAOD is expected to be around 1.3 % (TTBar) and 2% (ZTT). Breakdowns are available [here](https://cernbox.cern.ch/s/7ImmLYlChHIIS41).\r\n\r\nThis PR also allows the tau decay products to be monitored by NanoDQM.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

The interface and src files are still left in CondFormats/BTauObjects. The reason is that I found it a bit unnecessary to create a complete new library for just one class. Also, there would be a need for separate classes_def.xml and classes.h files, since we would like to have the BTagCalibrationReader accessible from python.\n\nFurthermore, all files in RecoBTag/PerformanceDB that are connected to BTagCalibration (new format) are moved into CondTools/BTau, which is a new Package. It seems to me that everything that is left in RecoBTag/PerformanceDB belongs to the old b tag scale factor format, but I can't say for sure.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 27, "closed_at": "1465298918", "comments": 50, "commits": 9, "created_at": "1461066833", "deletions": 269, "labels": ["alca-approved", "comparison-available", "db-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "011f9d8d295f3b1d95353631526ef21e960853a4", "merged_at": "1465298918", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 14148, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Update of BTagCalibrationReader and code move to CondTools/BTau", "updated_at": "1465298918", "user": "HeinerTholen"}

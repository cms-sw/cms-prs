This PR should cover the last uses of the deprecated `EventSetupRecord::get()` in `MixingModule` and `PreMixingModule`. In addition I removed all bare `new` calls from `EcalMixingModuleValidation`.\r\n\r\nIn `EcalDigiProducer` and `EcalDigiProducer_Ph2` (used by `MixingModule` and `PreMixingModule`) the changes were in `APDShape`, `EBShape`, and `EBShape` classes, that are also used several places outside of the `MixingModule`s.\r\n\r\nWithin the `BMixingModule` infrastructure there are still some calls in `DataMixingModule` that would either need to be migrated or removed (in a timescale of 9 months or so). I'm not planning to touch those.\r\n\r\nResolves https://github.com/makortel/framework/issues/221\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 32, "closed_at": "1630491615", "comments": 43, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1629154931", "deletions": 151, "labels": ["alca-approved", "dqm-approved", "l1-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "40f81cc631c5c1d2cab343a84a722cb120f02637", "merged_at": "1630491615", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "number": 34902, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Migrate BMixingModule and EcalShapeBase-derived classes to esConsumes", "updated_at": "1630491615", "user": "makortel"}

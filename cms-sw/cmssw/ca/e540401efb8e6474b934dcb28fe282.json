In normal operations this is carried out via O2O, but the functionality is kept here as a back-up.\r\nThe input file (`CondTools/SiStrip/data/tickheight.txt`) has been proposed to the `CondTools-SiStrip` data repo in the companion PR https://github.com/cms-data/CondTools-SiStrip/pull/1.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe unit test introduced here runs successfully.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1646165390", "comments": 44, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1645770494", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["fully-signed", "tests-approved", "db-approved", "orp-approved", "requires-external", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "767056007ac9e9c4ec8976cc5c376c5a704784c3", "merged_at": "1646165390", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 37066, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 18, "state": "closed", "title": "introduce `SiStripApvGainFromFileBuilder` (reprise)", "updated_at": "1646165391", "user": "mmusich"}

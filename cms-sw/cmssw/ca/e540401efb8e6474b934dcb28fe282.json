In normal operations this is carried out via O2O, but the functionality is kept here as a back-up.\r\nThe input file is currently in the `CondTools/SiStrip/data/` folder, but since it's large it would fit better a `cms-data` repository (that does not exist at the moment).\r\n\r\n**If a `CondTools-SiStrip` cms-data repo is created I will move the file there and remove it from git history (by the way there's a bunch of other files scattered in `cmssw` that would fit well there).**\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe unit test introduced here runs successfully.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "comments": 6, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1645770494", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["db-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 37066, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "introduce `SiStripApvGainFromFileBuilder` (reprise)", "updated_at": "1646032468", "user": "mmusich"}

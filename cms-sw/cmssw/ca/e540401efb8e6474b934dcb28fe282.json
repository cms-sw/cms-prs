In normal operations this is carried out via O2O, but the functionality is kept here as a back-up.\r\nThe input file (`CondTools/SiStrip/data/tickheight.txt`) has been proposed to the `CondTools-SiStrip` data repo in the companion PR https://github.com/cms-data/CondTools-SiStrip/pull/1.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe unit test introduced here runs successfully.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "comments": 14, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1645770494", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["db-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "requires-external", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 37066, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "introduce `SiStripApvGainFromFileBuilder` (reprise)", "updated_at": "1646036196", "user": "mmusich"}

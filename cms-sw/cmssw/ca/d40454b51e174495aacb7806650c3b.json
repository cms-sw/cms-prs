As is, when BPix1 is empty, we run the CA anyway, even if all the starting pairs have BPix1 as the inner layer. This is useless and not easy to spot. Instead of running the CA, now a `LogWarning` is printed. In principle, it would make sense to generalize this to all the possible starting layers (I wouldn't push this in this PR since it would need non-trivial changes).\r\n\r\nNote: since I was working on https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/49186, I've included https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/49282/commits/49b8b8a55f513258011104fa01b560ecb5cde86a from https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/49282 here.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 12, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1762156568", "deletions": 11, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "tracking"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_0_X", "number": 49286, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "open", "title": "Not Running the CA When Starting Layers are Empty", "updated_at": "1762274465", "user": "AdrianoDee"}

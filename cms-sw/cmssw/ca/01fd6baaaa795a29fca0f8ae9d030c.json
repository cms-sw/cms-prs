The new digitizer is called by the modifier_phase2_ecal_devel, from the Era_Phase2C11_Ecal_Devel. It creates the EcalDigiCollectionPh2. It also switches off the EE and ES detectors.\r\nIt is the continuation of the PR: https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/29386, but we moved from 11_1_X to 11_2_X.\r\n\r\nMost of the code have been already reviewed in the 11_1_X merge topic.\r\n\r\nIt it the baseline to start the new reconstruction for ecal phase2.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe test has been done using run the matrix:\r\n> runTheMatrix  28234.0 for phase2\r\n> runTheMatrix  10024.0 for phase1\r\n> and i modified 28234.0 calling\r\n> *******\r\n> from Configuration.Eras.Era_Phase2C11_Ecal_Devel_cff import\r\n> Phase2C11_Ecal_Devel\r\n>\r\n> process = cms.Process('DIGI',Phase2C11_Ecal_Devel)\r\n> ********\r\n\r\nThen running the full  runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos two processes didn't finish the run: \r\n35 34 31 23 15 4 1 1 1 tests passed, 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 failed\r\nboth with the error:\r\n\r\n----- Begin Fatal Exception 09-Oct-2020 13:55:18 CEST-----------------------\r\nAn exception of category 'Configuration' occurred while\r\n   [0] Constructing the EventProcessor\r\n   [1] Constructing module: class=PreMixingModule label='mixData'\r\nException Message:\r\nMissingParameter: Parameter 'timeDependent' not found.\r\n----- End Fatal Exception -------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nIt is the continuation of the PR: https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/29386, but we moved from 11_1_X to 11_2_X.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 53, "closed_at": "1606300920", "comments": 98, "commits": 30, "created_at": "1602239617", "deletions": 203, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "db-approved", "fully-signed", "operations-approved", "orp-approved", "pdmv-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "7c553b44184cc30305de43cb14bc3d023d2022a9", "merged_at": "1606300920", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 31726, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 36, "state": "closed", "title": "Ecal phase2 new digitization 11 2 x", "updated_at": "1606300920", "user": "dariosol"}

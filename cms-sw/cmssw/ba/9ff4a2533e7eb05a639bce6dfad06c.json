This PR sets the seeding layers correctly for both conversion and GSF tracks.\r\n\r\nOnly caveat is that `PhotonConversionTrajectorySeedProducerFromSingleLeg` only puts the first hit of the pair into the `TrajectorySeed` (https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/7d6f190a9a22b134851a160272dc06c46c1a5063/RecoTracker/ConversionSeedGenerators/plugins/SeedForPhotonConversion1Leg.cc#L167), so therefore the first layer of the pair is the only information we can deduce afterwards (without significant additional development).\r\n\r\nTested in 9_3_0_pre2, expecting changes in rates/tracks vs. seeding layer sets in conversion and GSF MTV instances because of different binning and now actually filling also bins other than \"Other/Unknown\".\r\n\r\n@rovere @VinInn ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1503585456", "comments": 10, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1502800419", "deletions": 9, "labels": ["code-checks-rejected", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "5bab10038aaa5c44021484654ae6e2f4340cf95a", "merged_at": "1503585456", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_3_X", "number": 20176, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix seeding layers in MultiTrackValidator for conversion and GSF tracks", "updated_at": "1503585456", "user": "makortel"}

One file is changed: `CaloLayer1Packer.cc`, moving the loop that sets `fg_bits` to inside the conditional to ensure that this is only done when `id` is found. `fg_bits` is declared as a uint_32, and the bit setting is done via |= (more robust than the initial implementation).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nPassed `runTheMatrix.py` in `CMSSW_12_4_X_2022-03-14-2300`.\r\n\r\nIn `CMSSW_12_4_ASAN_X_2022-03-14-1100`, step2 heap-buffer-overflow is resolved, tested with `runTheMatrix.py -l 39834.0`.\r\n\r\nThis is a forward PR to current master (12_4_X), instead of PR #37253 by request. Would eventually like to be included in 12_3_X via backport.

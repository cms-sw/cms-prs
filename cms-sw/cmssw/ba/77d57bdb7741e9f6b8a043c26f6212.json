They are shifted when the CLCTs are written to EDM ROOT files however. Because the ALCT-CLCT matching windows are quite wide (7BX) in the current CSC local trigger firmware and emulator, it has a negligible effect. However, it does start playing a role when the ALCT-CLCT matching window is reduced to 5BX and ultimately 3BX. That is foreseen in the \"SLHC\" version of the CSC local trigger.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the matching algorithm type was changed from CLCT-centric to ALCT-centric. This as always been the case in firmware. \r\n\r\nA redundant test TMB run function was also removed.\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses these issues.\r\n\r\n@tahuang1991 @lpernie @ptcox \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": "1535719502", "comments": 13, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1535469388", "deletions": 88, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "b31d8052ca82ff0b95b0daae704592cab9968205", "merged_at": "1535719502", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_3_X", "number": 24402, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "CLCTs are offset by 1 BX in matching", "updated_at": "1535719502", "user": "dildick"}

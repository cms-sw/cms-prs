Now, the harvester can read the plots booked by the worker in the 3rd step.\r\n\r\nThe results of the matrix test still contain corrections set to 0 though. The reason for that is insufficient (100) number of events. So, is there any way to increase the number of events to be more than 100?\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe 1042 relval behaves as expected.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "comments": 37, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1635404792", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["operations-pending", "alca-approved", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "bug-fix", "upgrade-approved", "requires-external", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_2_X", "number": 35874, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Fixed the PPS alignment relval - 1042", "updated_at": "1635561027", "user": "MatiXOfficial"}

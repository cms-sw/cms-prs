This is useful in Heavy Ion runs, where large events make the job exceed the allowed runtime.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nTested by running several validation campaigns in CMSSW_15_1_0_patch3, e.g. [[1](https://amecca.web.cern.ch/Alignment/Validation/2025/HI_prompt_PCL_run399925/PV/)] [[2](https://amecca.web.cern.ch/Alignment/Validation/2025/DMR_PV_GC_HI2025_PCL/PV/)].\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

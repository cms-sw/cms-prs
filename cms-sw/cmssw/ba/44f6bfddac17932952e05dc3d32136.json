The additions ensure that files defined for a dataset do in fact exist and that files merged from multiple root files are not damaged.\r\n- Automatic result plots were removed from test/autoSubmitter/autoSubmitter.py as this feature was not used and makes maintaning the code more complicated. Result plots can still be created using the code in test/plottingTools.\r\n- Minor errors were fixed.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\npython3 compatibility was mainly enabled based on output of 2to3. Additionally, the code was dry-run in a CMSSW environment that was compiled with python3.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1593960714", "comments": 28, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1593603822", "deletions": 156, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "ecf8a20bd598298e6d3877c5fc3da0e267502897", "merged_at": "1593960714", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 30483, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Changes to ape tool for python 3 compatibility and reduced bloat", "updated_at": "1593960714", "user": "mteroerd"}

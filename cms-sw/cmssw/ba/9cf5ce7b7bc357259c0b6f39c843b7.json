The pulse shapes were determined by phase scans, as described in https://indico.cern.ch/event/1336438/contributions/5626382/attachments/2733633/4753627/HBHE_Pulse_shape_study.pdf. The new pulse shapes have not yet been turned on, pending final timing adjustment.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe usual matrix text were run. Also, privately, the new pulse shapes were switched on (parameter \"useChannelShapes\" in HBHEPhase1Reconstructor_cfi.py was set True), and the code appears to produce reasonable results on the 2023 data workflow, as indicated by the subsequent Hcal rechit dump.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 15, "comments": 22, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1726161056", "deletions": 67, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "alca-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "hcal"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_0_X", "number": 45995, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 10, "state": "open", "title": "Infrastructure for using channel-dependent pulse shapes for HB/HE", "updated_at": "1757484236", "user": "igv4321"}

I just took the code from master here to keep things easy:\r\n  * RecoEgamma/ElectronIdentification/src/ElectronMVAEstimator.cc\r\n  * RecoEgamma/ElectronIdentification/src/SoftElectronMVAEstimator.cc\r\n  * RecoEgamma/ElectronIdentification/interface/ElectronMVAEstimator.h\r\n  * RecoEgamma/ElectronIdentification/interface/SoftElectronMVAEstimator.h\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles but I had no chance with the matrix test due to numerous DAS errors. Guess the bot will do better!\r\n\r\nIf you want to test the PR locally as well, there are some extra steps needed besides the usual `git cms-merge-topic` or `git cms-rebase-topic`:\r\n1. Get tinyxml2 [1] and put tinyxml2.h and tinyxml2.cc into CommonTools/MVAUtils/src/\r\n2. Change `#include <tinyxml2.h>` in the GBRForestTools [2] to `#include \"tinyxml2.h\"`\r\n3. Go into `RecoParticleFlow/PFProducer`, clone https://github.com/cms-data/RecoParticleFlow-PFProducer and rename the cloned repository to `data`.\r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/leethomason/tinyxml2\r\n[2] https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/CommonTools/MVAUtils/src/GBRForestTools.cc#L10", "branch": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "changed_files": 88, "comments": 6, "commits": 23, "created_at": "1552478328", "deletions": 2043, "labels": ["alca-pending", "analysis-pending", "comparison-pending", "db-pending", "l1-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "requires-external", "tests-started", "upgrade-pending", "xpog-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 26170, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[10.2.X] GBRForest implementation without TMVA", "updated_at": "1552492031", "user": "guitargeek"}

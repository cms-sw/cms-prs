I just took the code from master here to keep things easy:\r\n  * RecoEgamma/ElectronIdentification/src/ElectronMVAEstimator.cc\r\n  * RecoEgamma/ElectronIdentification/src/SoftElectronMVAEstimator.cc\r\n  * RecoEgamma/ElectronIdentification/interface/ElectronMVAEstimator.h\r\n  * RecoEgamma/ElectronIdentification/interface/SoftElectronMVAEstimator.h\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles and local matrix tests pass.\r\n\r\nIf you want to test the PR locally as well, there are some extra steps needed besides the usual `git cms-merge-topic` or `git cms-rebase-topic`:\r\n1. Get tinyxml2 [1] and put tinyxml2.h and tinyxml2.cc into CommonTools/MVAUtils/src/\r\n2. Change `#include <tinyxml2.h>` in the GBRForestTools [2] to `#include \"tinyxml2.h\"`\r\n3. Go into `RecoParticleFlow/PFProducer`, clone https://github.com/cms-data/RecoParticleFlow-PFProducer and rename the cloned repository to `data`.\r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/leethomason/tinyxml2\r\n[2] https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/CommonTools/MVAUtils/src/GBRForestTools.cc#L10", "branch": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "changed_files": 88, "closed_at": "1552644570", "comments": 18, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1552478328", "deletions": 2043, "labels": ["alca-pending", "analysis-pending", "comparison-pending", "db-pending", "l1-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending", "upgrade-pending", "xpog-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 26170, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "[10.2.X] GBRForest implementation without TMVA", "updated_at": "1552644571", "user": "guitargeek"}

As previously done, a separate folder is added for trigger paths using the UParT tagger, while still keeping DeepJet and ParticleNet folders.  Only expected change is a separate folder ending with *_UParTAK4 for the different paths containing all the same plots. \r\n\r\n**PR Validation:**\r\n\r\nThese changes pass the basic tests suggested in [https://cms-sw.github.io/PRWorkflow.html](https://cms-sw.github.io/PRWorkflow.html) with the exception of some workflows that have missing input files. Workflow 12834.0 runs without any error and the new folders and plots are visible in the local GUI for this workflow.

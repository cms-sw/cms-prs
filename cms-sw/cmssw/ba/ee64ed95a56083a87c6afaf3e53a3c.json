The promising results are obtained [1,2], but needs more time to finalize it. It means it is important to have this information in packedCandidates, so that the PUPPI weights can be recomputed on-the-fly from MINIAOD.\r\n\r\n[0] https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/files/3056535/he_depth_reco.pdf\r\n[1] https://indico.cern.ch/event/799365/contributions/3333038/attachments/1805670/2946660/pre.pdf\r\n[2] https://indico.cern.ch/event/799365/contributions/3339621/attachments/1805694/2946705/JK_JetMET_03_19_2.pdf\r\n\r\nIf this ValueMap-based implementation as suggested by @slava77 and @peruzzim looks good, this may supersede:\r\n[3] https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/26363\r\nNow.

But I think it  would be a pity not being able of monitoring those HLT paths in 72X, when the PR exists in 73X and it is now ready also for 72X.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_2_X", "changed_files": 23, "closed_at": "1412741162", "comments": 9, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1412660826", "deletions": 141, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "b5516f4d98f3adecbe0c93ac0d5136a02338b4f9", "merged_at": "1412741162", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_2_X", "number": 5715, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "EXO Val Dev backported to 72X", "updated_at": "1414223247", "user": "perrotta"}

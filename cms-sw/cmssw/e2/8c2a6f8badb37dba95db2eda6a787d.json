That can lead to the PoolOutputModule thread stealing a CMSSW task, potentially a long running one (like G4 simulation),  leading to lengthy PoolOutputModule stalls.  This has been observed to cause significant performance degradation and excessive stalls for GEN-SIM jobs with 24 or more threads.  This was observed by @slava77 in scaling tests with 32 threads.\r\n\r\nThis PR wraps the primary PoolOutputModule call to TTree::Fill inside a TBB this_task_arena::isolate() context that restricts the current thread to only execute tasks created by it or its children, preventing stealing of other CMSSW tasks.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1524120130", "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1524064259", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "66154d183158d7f8676d77a0be1b7688b2a8b649", "merged_at": "1524120130", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 23002, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "isolate TTree::Fill so IMT doesn't steal long running CMS tasks", "updated_at": "1524120131", "user": "dan131riley"}

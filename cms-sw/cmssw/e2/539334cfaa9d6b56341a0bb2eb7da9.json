I have checked that HLT results stays the same.\n- Modified Electron.h and Photon.h DF to add the two numbers. (DataFormats/PatCandidates)\n- Updated PAT and MiniAOD configurations to store the value in the object. (PhysicsTools/PatAlgos)\n\nThe idea is to compute at RECO level the valuemap with the isolation values and propagate it to the miniAOD.\nRight now the filling is not activated since we are missing the ValueMap into RECO relvals so it wouldn't pass the standard tests. I have privately checked the filling is ok.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 30, "closed_at": "1427455494", "comments": 8, "commits": 13, "created_at": "1427207687", "deletions": 167, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-available", "hlt-approved", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "0c32b85535ffd0fd3c375d6028dbde29bf99fe39", "merged_at": "1427455494", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 8501, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": " Add PFCluster Isolation to miniAOD electrons and photons (as #8221 , redone in 740pre9)", "updated_at": "1427455494", "user": "slava77"}

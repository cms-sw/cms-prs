Any other version of NN before this was merely experimental on software side and never worked at P5. After talking with @perrotta , I decided to remove the support for previous versions completely since they should never be used.\r\n\r\n- Most of the rework is in `PtAssignmentEngineDxy.cc` to implement the new input/output for the NNv16. \r\n- `Common.h` changes since the NN input features have different size now\r\n- `PtAssignment.cc` change due to NN output now being pT instead of 1/pT\r\n- `PtAssignmentEngineAux.cc` change due to new `dxy` binning in firmware\r\n- `simEmtfDigis.py` change for the new NN version.\r\n\r\nThis PR requires https://github.com/cms-data/L1Trigger-L1TMuon/pull/24 for tests.\r\n\r\nThis PR will be backported to 13_1_X and 13_0_X to make emulator agree with online firmware. \r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with a description of the feature proposed or problem addressed, specifying:\r\n  - what changes are expected in the output if any, \r\n  - what other PRs or externals it depends upon if any,\r\n  - link to any additional material useful to provide a documentation for this PR (slides, JIRA tickets, related pull requestes, hypernews, TWiki or Indico pages)  -->\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nValidated by checking firmware/emulator comparisons. Also ran `runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos` no failures (other than a fail due to input file) were seen.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with a description of which tests have been performed to verify the correctness of the PR, including the eventual addition of new code for testing like unit tests, test configurations, additions or updates to the runTheMatrix test workflows -->\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

This PR tries to fix this (on top of fixing the original UB issue).\r\n\r\n`LogTrace` calls are added to ease debugging. In addition, technical changes to modernise both classes are applied (e.g. `const` correctness).\r\n\r\nExpect changes in the DQM outputs of `HLTMuonValidator` (and nowhere else).\r\n\r\n[1]\r\nThe value of `hltStep` becomes `(size_t) -1` when `step == 2` and `nSteps == 6`, leading to undefined behaviour in\r\nhttps://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/6f5b833d1b878aa570c87d4237e638362684a7a6/HLTriggerOffline/Muon/src/HLTMuonPlotter.cc#L221\r\nThis was originally reported in #12056, but apparently not fixed back then.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nPrivate tests.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

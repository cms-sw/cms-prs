However I thought it would be nice to have the rest of the PR available to also receive comments rather than waiting to explore that suggestion.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n```\r\n hltIntegrationTests v3-test/run3:/dev/CMSSW_12_0_0/Fake -s /dev/CMSSW_12_0_0/GRun -i /store/data/Run2018D/EphemeralHLTPhysics1/RAW/v1/000/323/790/00000/15FD6507-9B9A-DE49-973B-B63C4DEDC226.root -x  \"--globaltag auto:run3_hlt\" --dbproxy \r\nhltGetConfiguration v3-test/run3:/dev/CMSSW_12_0_0/Fake --dbproxy\r\nhltConfigFromDB --configName /dev/CMSSW_12_0_0/GRun/V1  --dbproxy --v3-test --run3\r\n```\r\n\r\nwork as expected at RAL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nbackport of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/35987\r\n\r\nusers will be still be using this release for a while and will need HLT services such as this\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": "1636728415", "comments": 17, "commits": 8, "created_at": "1636451156", "deletions": 34, "labels": ["hlt-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "backport-ok"], "merge_commit_sha": "e8b78ddc4c6d6554e9232fba3ee56e67382a4018", "merged_at": "1636728414", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "number": 36051, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "Adding Proxy Support to hltGetConfiguration and fixing converter/db specification bugs with hltIntegrationTests: 12_1_X", "updated_at": "1636728415", "user": "Sam-Harper"}

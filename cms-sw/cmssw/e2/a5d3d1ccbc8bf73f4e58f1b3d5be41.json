A number of plots were not filled for HEP17 last year because it would have mixed QIE8 and QIE11 digis; QIE11-specific plots were created in QIE11Task. Now that HE==QIE11, I integrated the plots of interest from QIE11Task to DigiTask. \r\n\r\nI also included one small bug fix for LaserTask: with the 2018 HE, the range for the laser signal has to be increased.\r\n\r\nNote that I based this PR on top of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/22595, which fixed the new digi size for 2018 in DigiTask, so that PR should be merged first.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 16, "closed_at": "1523424571", "comments": 35, "commits": 16, "created_at": "1521811629", "deletions": 179, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "87adbc6d3b4dd1febb4db778bf7e00fe8cef9a30", "merged_at": "1523424571", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 22724, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "HCALDQM: Update DigiTask for 2018 HE (10_1_X)", "updated_at": "1523424571", "user": "DryRun"}

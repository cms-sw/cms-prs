I removed a bunch of very old stuff from aging.py, and added a set of functions and corresponding HCAL conditions for the agreed-upon aging scenarios:\r\n>i) 300 fb-1, 1000fb-1 and 3000fb-1 with an instantaneous luminosity of 5E34, the nominal scenario\r\n>ii) 3000fb-1 and 4500fb-1 with an instantaneous luminosity of 7.5E34, the ultimate scenario\r\n\r\nCurrently the HCAL conditions ignore the lumi ramp-up period after LS3/4 and just use the final instantaneous lumi (for simplicity).\r\n\r\nFor future reference, here are the two HL-LHC schedules:\r\n![HL-LHC schedules](http://kjplanet.com/pr/HL-LHC-lumi-profile-ultimate.png)", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1493142359", "comments": 16, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1493058203", "deletions": 247, "labels": ["alca-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "e7360be97fb9a8a1cd85c2082faabb0ae7bee887", "merged_at": "1493142359", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_1_X", "number": 18452, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Clean up aging.py and set up HB TDR aging", "updated_at": "1493142359", "user": "kpedro88"}

So for example:\r\n\r\n1. `particleFlowClusterHGCalFromMultiCl` will no longer exist as `particleFlowClusterHGCal` is TICL based.\r\nThe sim-cluster based `particleFlowClusterHGCal` is still kept (now called `particleFlowClusterHGCalFromSimCl`, and packed into `_phase2_hgcal_simPFTask` [2]), if it's required by other modules.\r\n\r\n2. At RECO: `ecalDrivenGsfElectronsFromMultiCl`/`photonsFromMultiCl` --> `ecalDrivenGsfElectronsHGC`/`photonsHGC`.\r\nThe new collections now contain only HGCal electrons and photons due to [3, 4] (earlier they used to contain the barrel too).\r\nThe plot shows the eta distributions of `ecalDrivenGsfElectronsHGC` (blue) and `ecalDrivenGsfElectronsFromMultiCl` (red).\r\n![hgcal_ele_eta_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15279834/125169119-0b492e00-e1a9-11eb-8887-2f7b6d6ce253.png)\r\n\r\n3. At MINIAOD: `slimmedElectronsFromMultiCl`/`slimmedPhotonsFromMultiCl` --> `slimmedElectronsHGC`/`slimmedPhotonsHGC`. These collections should remain the same, as it's just a renaming.\r\nThe plot shows the eta distributions of `slimmedElectronsHGC` (blue) and `slimmedElectronsFromMultiCl` (red).\r\n![slimmedElectronsHGC_eta](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15279834/125169147-21ef8500-e1a9-11eb-96dc-fef72e198d37.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] [cms-sw/cmssw#32475 (comment)](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/32475#issuecomment-801167501)\r\n[2] https://github.com/SohamBhattacharya/cmssw/blob/clean_FromMultiCl_12_0_0_pre3/RecoParticleFlow/Configuration/python/RecoParticleFlow_cff.py#L76\r\n[3] https://github.com/SohamBhattacharya/cmssw/blob/clean_FromMultiCl_12_0_0_pre3/RecoEgamma/EgammaElectronProducers/python/ecalDrivenGsfElectronCoresHGC_cff.py#L6\r\n[4] https://github.com/SohamBhattacharya/cmssw/blob/clean_FromMultiCl_12_0_0_pre3/RecoEgamma/EgammaPhotonProducers/python/photonCore_cfi.py#L20\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 41, "closed_at": "1628608839", "comments": 63, "commits": 16, "created_at": "1625926833", "deletions": 177, "labels": ["dqm-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-rejected", "orp-approved", "upgrade-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "8f85f65d30fd0585a358e84cf7825a4f656d8d30", "merged_at": "1628608839", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "number": 34439, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 20, "state": "closed", "title": "Clean/rename FromMultiCl HGCal egamma collections", "updated_at": "1628608840", "user": "SohamBhattacharya"}

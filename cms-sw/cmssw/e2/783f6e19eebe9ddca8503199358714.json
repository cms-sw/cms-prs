Will be reverted after MWGR.\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1621577178", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1621342643", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["alca-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "d07a829c279e897d9bf8245e497ee6678e74934a", "merged_at": "1621577178", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 33765, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 8, "state": "closed", "title": "Test ECAL pedestals in next MWGR", "updated_at": "1621577179", "user": "francescobrivio"}

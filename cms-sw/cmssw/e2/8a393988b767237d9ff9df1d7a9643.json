This work is focusing on the division of GE21 information by modules (M1-M4). It is necessary because of the electronic configuration of GE21 chambers.\r\n\r\nIt is also included that the module information is propagated to the GEM unpacker in a better way, which is done by @yeckang.\r\n\r\nThis update was planned to be implemented in CMSSW_12_6_X (#39985), but it wasn't because this PR was merged \"after\" the 12_6 branch was detached from HEAD, unfortunately. This PR is a fix for this accident.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe updates are exactly the same as #39985, and the previous PR is already valid.\r\n\r\n@jshlee @watson-ij @seungjin-yang @yeckang ", "branch": "CMSSW_12_6_X", "changed_files": 11, "closed_at": "1682921668", "comments": 15, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1675667842", "deletions": 80, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "dqm-approved", "simulation-approved", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "hold", "upgrade-approved", "backport-ok", "gem"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_6_X", "number": 40699, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "[12_6_X] Updates on GE21 online/offlineDQM plots with division on modules", "updated_at": "1682921668", "user": "quark2"}

This bug should not affect anything when an exception does not occur.\r\n\r\nI noticed this problem as I was working on nearby code. It was not reported by a user.\r\n\r\nAlso I modified some names to more consistently use ```ProductLabel``` instead of various other terms used for the same thing in code directly related to the bug.\r\n\r\nThe bug was caused by using an index into the container esItemsToGetFromTransition_ to access an element of the container m_esTokenInfo. Under certain circumstances this can cause the wrong product label to print in the error message.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nExisting unit tests pass.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1724240131", "comments": 12, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1723832443", "deletions": 33, "labels": ["core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "5bf1f9958d094c25a60abbec1e0c4618e795f1ba", "merged_at": "1724240131", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 45726, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix bug affecting label in exception message", "updated_at": "1724240132", "user": "wddgit"}

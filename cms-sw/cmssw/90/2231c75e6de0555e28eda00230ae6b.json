This bug should not affect anything when an exception does not occur.\r\n\r\nI noticed this problem as I was working on nearby code. It was not reported by a user.\r\n\r\nAlso I modified some names to more consistently use ```ProductLabel``` instead of various other terms used for the same thing in code directly related to the bug.\r\n\r\nThe bug was caused by using an index into the container esItemsToGetFromTransition_ to access an element of the container m_esTokenInfo. Under certain circumstances this can cause the wrong product label to print in the error message.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nExisting unit tests pass.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 4, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1723832443", "deletions": 20, "labels": ["core-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 45726, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Fix bug affecting label in exception message", "updated_at": "1723832678", "user": "wddgit"}

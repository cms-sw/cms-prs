They affect the track-based per-cm histograms in SiStripMonitorTrack. The off-track cluster based plots are unaffected.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1458202725", "comments": 18, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1455812060", "deletions": 35, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "cc00b37bbca96e3528f175e88f1da393869085b8", "merged_at": "1458202725", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 13398, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add cuts to SiStripMonitorTrack", "updated_at": "1458202726", "user": "schneiml"}

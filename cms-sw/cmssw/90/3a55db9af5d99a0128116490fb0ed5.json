Optionally an alternative scheme with termperature dependent requirements can be selected (\"convergence_mode\").\r\nTwo previously hardcoded cuts in the trackselection have been made configurable (\"maxDzError\", \"maxD0Error\") in order to be more flexible with high eta tracks used for phase 2. \r\n\r\nrelated presentations:\r\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/894865/contributions/3773737/attachments/2000277/3338756/2020-03-09-clustering-speed.pdf\r\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/903822/contributions/3814735/attachments/2015768/3369185/2020-04-06-clustering-update.pdf\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nThe code has been tested locally with 85PU run3 MC (minbias) and 200PU run4 MC (minbias and ttbar) in CMSSW_11_0_pre6 as described in the presentations linked above.\r\nSmall event-by-event changes on individual vertices are found, but no significant difference is found in histograms of typical quality indicators.\r\n\r\nrunTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos  \r\n34 33 32 26 16 4 1 1 1 tests passed, 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 failed\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 15, "closed_at": "1589906248", "comments": 76, "commits": 24, "created_at": "1588594126", "deletions": 969, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "af0491716a5e551e527bc33c4e995e5870823467", "merged_at": "1589906248", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 29626, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 34, "state": "closed", "title": "Da clustering speedup", "updated_at": "1589906248", "user": "werdmann"}

Checked that this is the case indeed.\r\n**This allows to reuse the fakeConditions from T15.**\r\n- Checked workflow numbering.\r\n- Checked that workflows with D51 and D52 run smoothly with no extra error / warning.\r\n\r\nFYI: @emiglior @pwittich @bsunanda @fabiocos @kpedro88 @mmusich @jalimena @boudoul", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 13, "closed_at": "1575446156", "comments": 15, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1574959903", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "operations-approved", "orp-approved", "pdmv-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "8122670b541c64139528af145fdddda97f3e1f20", "merged_at": "1575446156", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 28503, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 6, "state": "closed", "title": "Add Phase 2 TFPX geometries (T17 and T18)", "updated_at": "1575446157", "user": "ghugo83"}

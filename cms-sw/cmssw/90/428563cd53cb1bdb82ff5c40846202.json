This PR proposes to adjust the number of DQM sequences\r\nFrom original PR discussion:\r\n\r\n> Currently we have 321 sequences returned by `cmsswSequenceInfo.py --runTheMatrix --steps DQM,VALIDATION` which should be processed by `TestDQMOfflineConfiguration_NN` unit tests and `TestDQMOfflineConfigurationGotAll` should not process any sequences (otherwise it should fail).\r\n> I could have set this number to 321 but I decided to set it to 329 so that if new extra sequences are added then they can be processed by `TestDQMOfflineConfiguration_NN` untill we hit 330 sequences\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n`scram b runtests_TestDQMOfflineConfigurationGotAll` runs fine.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

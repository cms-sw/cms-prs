I'll attept to elaborate the point once more:\r\n\r\n1. Besides forward declarations, these forward headers usually define a few `typedef`s such that the DataFormats can be used efficiently in other header files without including the full interface\r\n2. However, if you include a DataFormat in a `.cc` source, you do so with the intention of actually using it's interface, while still relying on the `typedef`s. So right now it's a very common pattern to include both the forward header and and full header in `.cc` sources.\r\n3. For brevity and to ensure they `typedef`s are always consistent, the full headers should include the forward headers themselves.\r\n4. In that case, the `.cc` sources should never have to include forward headers anymore.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts on this? What are the arguments in favour of strictly separating the header files?

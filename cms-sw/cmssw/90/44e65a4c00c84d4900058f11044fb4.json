This PR is an alternative to https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/36968 and tries to fix the problem at the source, in the RawToDigi code. This is a technical fix so no impact on physics is expected.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe code compiles and was tested to successfully run with the MinimumBias workflow 139.001.\r\n\r\n@tsusa @mmusich\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 11, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1645555819", "deletions": 8, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "bug-fix", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 37035, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "open", "title": "Avoid storing empty DetSet containers in the pixel digi collection", "updated_at": "1645706642", "user": "ferencek"}

This PR is an alternative to https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/36968 and tries to fix the problem at the source, in the RawToDigi code. This is a technical fix so no impact on physics is expected.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe code compiles and was tested to successfully run with the MinimumBias workflow 139.001.\r\n\r\n@tsusa @mmusich\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1646222536", "comments": 24, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1645555819", "deletions": 8, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "bug-fix", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "fd8e64b8e3099a4b16a343efdbe271877c144509", "merged_at": "1646222536", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 37035, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "Avoid storing empty DetSet containers in the pixel digi collection", "updated_at": "1646222537", "user": "ferencek"}

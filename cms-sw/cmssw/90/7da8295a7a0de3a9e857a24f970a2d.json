This PR prevents weight duplication by setting `Pythia8ToHepMC::set_store_weights(false)` and keeps the old weight structure the same as in UL by push_back 0th weight manually.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested with the workflow `555`, `556` (should reduce the number of weights from 134 to 46)\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nBackport of #38012. This PR is intended for 12_4_X, to prevent PS weight duplication in the large scale Run3 MC production.\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1653462719", "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1653386978", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["generators-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "backport-ok"], "merge_commit_sha": "13c2242eca40a82edc14c1b06898b8694e744222", "merged_at": "1653462719", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 38057, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "[12_4_X] Push_back 0th weight manually, prevent duplication of PS weights in P8.30x", "updated_at": "1653462719", "user": "SanghyunKo"}

The old threshold has been at 1 GeV, which is too low and the plots are dominated by detector noise seen in previous cosmic runs. The new threshold is set at 4 GeV, which should be well above the average noise levels reported by ECAL. Filling conditions are also added to be consistent with normal events filling, i.e. do not fill if there is problematic tower masked etc.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nThe codes are tested by running offline DQM on recent runs with unstable beams collisions, which has more high energy TPs to see the real effects. The DQM plots are properly filled and the ECAL experts are satisfied with this modification.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1655153088", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "ecal"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 38361, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Change at CaloLayer1 DQM the filling threshold for ECAL 5BX plots", "updated_at": "1655572414", "user": "hftsoi"}

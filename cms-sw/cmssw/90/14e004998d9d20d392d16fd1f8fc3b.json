CMSSW code https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/DQM/EcalMonitorTasks/python/SelectiveReadoutTask_cfi.py#L3-L7 was generating bins with same value (see https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/49307#issuecomment-349352188 ). This PR proposes to fix this code so that it generates bins in increasing order. Code is also a little improved and avoid multiplications and divisions in loop.\r\n\r\nThough we might not build 15.1.X with newer root but it is better to fix the Ecal bins and avoid duplicate entires.

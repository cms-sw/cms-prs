The `setTopo` method of the containers is now non-const. Therefore to fully initialize a container read from the database, the container is copied and the copy gets the `setTopo` call. This copy is either done via an ESProducer or, for less used containers, by the module which requested the original container.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_3_X", "changed_files": 36, "closed_at": "1414733336", "comments": 35, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1414530839", "deletions": 224, "labels": ["alca-pending", "analysis-approved", "comparison-available", "db-pending", "dqm-pending", "hlt-pending", "l1-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "4c31c9ffb65c693a02641821a76ccc20b3d9050e", "merged_at": "1414733336", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_3_X", "number": 6060, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Thread safe access to HCAL conditions containers", "updated_at": "1415110813", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

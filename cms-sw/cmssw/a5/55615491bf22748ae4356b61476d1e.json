Removing legacy modules handling it.\n- FED 812 is superseded by TCDS FED, so removing a test parser for it.\n- Convert legacy modules to edm::one (modules are only used for testing)\n- catch(...) in source replaced with catching cms::Exception\n- removed dead assignment\n- add comments about null pointer assignment exceptions that are intentionally placed in ExceptionGenerator module\n- static variable in Raw output module was reported as thread safety issue, but was needed for the signal handler. Now doing the runEnd action when application is interrupted is achieved based on framework signal handling.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 18, "closed_at": "1468287230", "comments": 15, "commits": 10, "created_at": "1468095503", "deletions": 581, "labels": ["comparison-available", "daq-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "42418c2929b66a15fdbca16f0bb341ad1cd93463", "merged_at": "1468287230", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 15159, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Removing obsolete FED 1023 handling and fixes for static checks (DAQ) - 81X", "updated_at": "1468287231", "user": "smorovic"}

Can only get better for more complex things.\n\n@gpetruc @arizzi \n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1439010095", "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1438791695", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "95d03ca891d61fabd02cf6895ac02de183f75369", "merged_at": "1439010095", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 10592, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Pileup summary info slimmer for MiniAOD", "updated_at": "1439010095", "user": "lgray"}

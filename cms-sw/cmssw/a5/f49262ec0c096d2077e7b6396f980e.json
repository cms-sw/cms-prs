In the initial version of this PR only the geometry D49 configuration is explicitly added (while workflows are possibly built for any Phase2 scenario). If there is agreement on this strategy I may update the PR by adding configurations for any active scenario, in any case the ```generateGeometry.py``` script is instructed to produce whatever Phase2 DD4hep configuration required. I add a few fixes to the geometry dictionaries to keep in synchrony them with the latest version available (for 2021) and have the dd4hep modifier available for MTD (other sub-detectors will have to check).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles and produces the desired configurations, tested for 2021 and 2026D49 both as compressed and expanded python configuration. The workflow list shows workflows for all scenarios, but their building fails but for D49, as the geometry configurations are not provided for the time being.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 44, "closed_at": "1604015515", "comments": 38, "commits": 9, "created_at": "1603894584", "deletions": 78, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "operations-approved", "orp-approved", "pdmv-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "a4f7c7b60e6af9714a1b1db4245b7dd94410a079", "merged_at": "1604015515", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 31975, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "DD4hep RelVal for Phase2: update geometry configuration and PyReleaseValidation ", "updated_at": "1604015515", "user": "fabiocos"}

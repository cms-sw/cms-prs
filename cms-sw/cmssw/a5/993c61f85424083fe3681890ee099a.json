It hasn't been under development for many years. This is motivated by the ::JetCorrector migration. This code inherits from the deprecated ::JetCorrector class. We are migrating away from that class with the intent to delete it entirely soon.\r\n\r\n@smuzaffar This package will be basically empty after this PR is merged. I don't know how to delete a package or if it is worth the effort, but this package could be deleted entirely.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nNone needed. Just deletions.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1666718193", "deletions": 351, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_6_X", "number": 39848, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Remove deprecated JetPartonCorrector", "updated_at": "1666797792", "user": "wddgit"}

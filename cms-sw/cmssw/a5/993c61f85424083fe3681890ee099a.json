It hasn't been under development for many years. This is motivated by the ::JetCorrector migration. This code inherits from the deprecated ::JetCorrector class. We are migrating away from that class with the intent to delete it entirely soon.\r\n\r\n@smuzaffar This package will be basically empty after this PR is merged. I don't know how to delete a package or if it is worth the effort, but this package could be deleted entirely.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nNone needed. Just deletions.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1666878520", "comments": 14, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1666718193", "deletions": 351, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "1d782e5a8f081a468fab39f4346a4e69374fdf40", "merged_at": "1666878520", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_6_X", "number": 39848, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Remove deprecated JetPartonCorrector", "updated_at": "1666878521", "user": "wddgit"}

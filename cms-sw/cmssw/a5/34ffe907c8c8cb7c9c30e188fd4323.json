The JIRA ticket of the integration of these triggers is linked [here](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSHLT-2291). The topic of jet mass trigger DQM, and these updates, were discussed in [this B2G meeting](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1170215/).\r\n\r\nThe new paths have the same monitoring as the already previously included HLT_AK8PFJet400_TrimMass30_v except for a change in pt threshold and SD mass binning, which were also applied to the old HLT_AK8PFJet400_TrimMass30_v.\r\n\r\nThis PR aims for inclusion in the next possible release.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe complete workflow was tested using `runTheMatrix.py -l 11634.0` verifying that the histograms are properly created. The changes were also tested by running the DQM and harvesting steps on different RelVal samples, to check whether the histograms are properly filled. The basic test procedure as instructed in the [CMSSW PR instructions](https://cms-sw.github.io/PRWorkflow.html) was run and passed all tests.\r\n\r\nI hope the above information is complete, if not I'd be happy to provide anything that might be needed.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 0, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1657020194", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 38600, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "B2G SD mass jet trigger DQM", "updated_at": "1657020257", "user": "finnlabe"}

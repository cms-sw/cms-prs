On the same go, two issues are fixed\r\n- `run2_GEM_2017` was not applied for `Run2_2017_trackingPhase1CA` or `Run2_2017_trackingRun2`\r\n- `run2_HEPlan1_2017` is removed from `Run2_2018` (@kpedro88's intention in #17605)\r\n\r\nand a matrix workflow for `Run2_2017_trackingLowPU` is added.\r\n\r\nTested in 9_0_0_pre5 (rebased on top of CMSSW_9_0_X_2017-02-27-2300). No changes expected in standard 2017 workflows (special tracking workflows should show the appearance of `run2_GEM_2017`). IIUC 2018 workflows should show HE plan1->plan36. No changes expected in other (<= 2016, phase2) workflows.\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "changed_files": 10, "closed_at": "1488388635", "comments": 18, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1488210984", "deletions": 22, "labels": ["comparison-available", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "09c3fce6626f70fd04223e7dacebf0b485f73f54", "merged_at": "1488388635", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "number": 17644, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Reorganize Run2_2017 eras, and add matrix workflow for Run2_2017_trackingLowPU", "updated_at": "1488388635", "user": "makortel"}

This treatment is consistent with what was done for calibrating the SiPM non-linearity so far in the lab. While eventually we will need to go back to correcting nonlinearity for individual time slices, we can not do so with the existing measurements and models.\r\n\r\nFor a detailed description of the problem, see the talks by Jim Hirschauer, Federico De Guio, and Pawel De Barbaro at https://indico.cern.ch/event/640431/\r\n\r\nPlease test and integrate asap, this fix is needed for the data taking.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1496462412", "comments": 27, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1495217502", "deletions": 11, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "c09fc84cd518e940b9f1c7e5670c65abf7e3d139", "merged_at": "1496462412", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_2_X", "number": 18866, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Switching to full pulse nonlinearity for SiPMs", "updated_at": "1496462412", "user": "igv4321"}

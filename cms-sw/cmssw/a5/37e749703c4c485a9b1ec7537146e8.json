This was requested on many occasions. Since this module is/was quite long the number of changes were also quite high. I tried to use the opportunity to also improve the style and formatting a bit. Moreover, I removed some old and unnecessary code blocks.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n- [x] `scram b code-format`\r\n- [x] `scram b code-checks`\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 2, "commits": 43, "created_at": "1667813097", "deletions": 572, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "xpog-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_6_X", "number": 40002, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Cmssw 12 5 2 rework met cors rebased", "updated_at": "1667909121", "user": "michaelwassmer"}

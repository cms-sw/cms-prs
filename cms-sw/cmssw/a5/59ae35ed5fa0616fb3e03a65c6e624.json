TBD)\n3) Iter5 and 6 are MVA only\n4) Muon iterations cuts are not identical (and requires further tuning)\n5) Duplicate rate a bit higher than before (it needs further tuning anyhow...)\n6) JetCore uses a simplified cut-based selection, waiting for its own specific MVA\n\nmanually ported from CMSSW_7_5_X #9538 (original by @VinInn).\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 201, "closed_at": "1437832587", "comments": 24, "commits": 186, "created_at": "1437029914", "deletions": 15979, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-available", "fastsim-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 10233, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "reimplementation of Track classifiers and Track Collection mergers", "updated_at": "1448119972", "user": "VinInn"}

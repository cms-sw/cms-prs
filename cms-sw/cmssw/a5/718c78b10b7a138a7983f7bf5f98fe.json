For now, just enough to run step1 and 2 (and RAW2DIGI works). Once GE0 is fully working, we will remove ME0 from the codebase, and then the modifier won't be necessary.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with a description of the feature proposed or problem addressed, specifying:\r\n  - what changes are expected in the output if any, \r\n  - what other PRs or externals it depends upon if any,\r\n  - link to any additional material useful to provide a documentation for this PR (slides, JIRA tickets, related pull requestes, hypernews, TWiki or Indico pages)  -->\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested on upgrade workflow 24821.0 replacing the D54 geometry with the Geometry/GEMGeometry/test/GeometryExtended2026GE0Test_cff.py geometry and adding the phase2_GE0 procModifier to the cmsDriver.py line.

The code look like the intention was to call `nanoAOD_runMETfixEE2017()` only if `run2_nanoAOD_94XMiniAODv1` or `run2_nanoAOD_94XMiniAODv2` modifiers are turned on.\r\n\r\nThe actual behavior is, however, different. The lines 276 and 283 contain a *call* to `nanoAOD_runMETfixEE2017()` function (instead of a function \"object\" to be called by `toModify()`), so it is called regardless of the status of the two modifiers (and twice because of the loop). The function itself\r\nhttps://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/4fdeedc0118aba13987ce237aab0bc9c4b12165f/PhysicsTools/NanoAOD/python/nano_cff.py#L236-L241\r\ndoes not explicitly return anything, so the return value is `None`.

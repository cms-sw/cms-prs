The innermost loop over track collections increments the index to histograms at the very end of the loop body. However, the there are `continue` statements within the body (one of them getting enabled in #10219), which prevent the index being increased. The effect is that histograms for other track collection get filled. The bug is fixed by moving the index increment inside the `for(;;)` clause.\n\nTested in CMSSW_7_6_X_2015-07-25-2300, expecting changes under `TrackAllTPEffic` folder (migration of tracks from `generalTracks` histograms to `cutsRecoHp` histograms that were empty before).\n\n@rovere @VinInn \n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1438147856", "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1438059911", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "tests-rejected"], "merge_commit_sha": "98bda7e37cbf5403b55708fe5023a931405ba6a7", "merged_at": "1438147856", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 10409, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix index increment in MultiTrackValidator for the presence of continues in loop body", "updated_at": "1476956471", "user": "makortel"}

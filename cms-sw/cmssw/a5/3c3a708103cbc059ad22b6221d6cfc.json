The re-reconstruction is added to MiniAOD setup (`PhysicsTools/PatAlgos/python/slimming/miniAOD_tools.py`) when the `run2_miniAOD_80XLegacy` Era is requested.\r\n\r\nExpected effect of the PR was discussed in the xPOG meeting on 5 September 2017 [1].\r\n\r\nNote 1: During the xPOG meeting it was agreed that the PR (when sent to official CMSSW repository) will be scrutinized, but its integration will be hold until Tau POG conveners  (@steggema,   @isobelojalvo) give their final green light. The procedure is to speedup the integration process.\r\n\r\nNote 2: The PR consists of purely technical modification of `PhysicsTools/PatAlgos/python/producersLayer1/tauProducer_cff.py` file: it is a cleaning which avoids re-reco of cut-based tau discriminants which is not necessary. In addition, input files for tau reco tests are updated in `RecoTauTag/Configuration/test/ZTT-validation.txt` file.\r\n\r\n[1] https://indico.cern.ch/event/663315/contributions/2708403/attachments/1518558/2371260/mbluj_TauId_80XLegacyMiniAOD_5Sep2017.pdf\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1506266863", "comments": 38, "commits": 9, "created_at": "1504771536", "deletions": 117, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "2492027532930cc296d1692732db7930d6c8a726", "merged_at": "1506266863", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_4_X", "number": 20412, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "Tau rereco for MiniAOD of 80X legacy samples", "updated_at": "1506266863", "user": "mbluj"}

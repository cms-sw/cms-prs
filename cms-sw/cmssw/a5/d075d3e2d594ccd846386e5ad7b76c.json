I'm citing from a comment that @mbluj has made: \r\n\r\n\"\"\"\r\n   * Fix in the RecoTauTag/RecoTau/plugins/PFTauTransverseImpactParameters.cc module allowing to use a gsfTrack associated to the tau leading charged candidate when it does not posses a KFTrack. It happens for candidates identified by PFlow as electrons (id==+-11). Usage of gsfTrack in a such case is a standard procedure in other tau modules, e.g. PV and SV producers.\r\n   * Cleaning of unused code: usually removal of not needed includes, once removal of a handle of not used collection.\r\n\r\nThe changes will result in small changes in reconstructed impact parameters and output of MVAIso discriminants. \r\n\"\"\"\r\n\r\nI've verified the change and during the standard quick validation procedures that we usually use for small changes like this I have observed the really small changes w.r.t. to before esp. in the MVA tau isolation. \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nRoger", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1512553355", "comments": 14, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1512145909", "deletions": 40, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "ca9bcdb51922d6cf2f3bf92c7ec396ee00e6c9cb", "merged_at": "1512553355", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_0_X", "number": 21631, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Code cleanup in TauPOG repositories + a fix that falls back to gsfTracks for leading charged candidates for which kftTracks are not available", "updated_at": "1512553355", "user": "roger-wolf"}

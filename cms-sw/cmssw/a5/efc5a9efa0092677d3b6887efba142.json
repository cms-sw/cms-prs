This PR introduces the new 2020Nov28 model. The following slide provides details on how correlated the two BDT model scores are, and the effect on the 2020Nov28 performance after the application of a threshold of 1.5 on the score from the 2020Sept15 model. These studies are pertinent to e.g. a \"UL nanoAOD v9\" production based on existing UL re-miniAOD samples. [201223_ID_correlation.pdf](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/files/5774997/201223_ID_correlation.pdf)\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe new ID has been tested locally with wfs 1325.518 (TTbar reminiAOD) and 136.88811 (JetHT, 2018D) and a comparison made with scores from the previous \"2020Sept15\" model. The BDT scores are in line with expectations.\r\n\r\nThe energy regression has been tested with the following wfs and candidate GTs from EGamma:\r\n- 1325.518 (TTbar reminiAOD), tested with 112X_upgrade2018_realistic_Candidate_2020_12_03_11_20_37\r\n- 136.88811 (JetHT, 2018D), tested with 112X_dataRun2_relval_Candidate_2020_12_04_15_09_56\r\n\r\nThe regressed energies are in line with expectations.

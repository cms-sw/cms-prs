This is required for TDR studies of HSCP particles.\n\nThe cluster \"high charge bit\" is set as soon as one digi has that bit on. This corresponds to the expected behavior of the CIC chip. \n\nTested with runTheMatrix.py --what upgrade -l 21200 in the last nightly. The output contains 7% of clusters with the bit set.\n\n@boudoul @atricomi @thomaslenzi \n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1477225279", "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1476343053", "deletions": 9, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "af91ba3c694fa47f1af1a2d4782c1afcca24f974", "merged_at": "1477225279", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 16200, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Propagate the overthreshold / high charge bit to phase2 clusters", "updated_at": "1477225280", "user": "delaere"}

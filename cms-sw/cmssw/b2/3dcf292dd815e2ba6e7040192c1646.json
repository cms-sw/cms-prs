The LUTs were deployed at P5 on May 28th, but they are not used in the emulator yet. \r\n\r\nThis PR needs the LUTs in https://github.com/cms-data/L1Trigger-L1TMuon/pull/28 to work.\r\n\r\nWe see improvement in EMTF performance at P5 with these new LUTs, so changes to muon efficiencies etc are expected when testing the re-emulation workflows from recent runs.\r\n\r\nThis PR will be backported to 14_0_X. \r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with a description of the feature proposed or problem addressed, specifying:\r\n  - what changes are expected in the output if any, \r\n  - what other PRs or externals it depends upon if any,\r\n  - link to any additional material useful to provide a documentation for this PR (slides, JIRA tickets, related pull requestes, hypernews, TWiki or Indico pages)  -->\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nValidated by comparing unpacked and re-emulated collections from recent runs. Emulator picks the correct LUTs based on firmware version. Results are as expected.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with a description of which tests have been performed to verify the correctness of the PR, including the eventual addition of new code for testing like unit tests, test configurations, additions or updates to the runTheMatrix test workflows -->\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

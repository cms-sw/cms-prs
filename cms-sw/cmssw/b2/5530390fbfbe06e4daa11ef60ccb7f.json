In details it correspond to BTauGenericMVAJetTagComputerRcd=MVAComputerContainer_75X_JetTags_v2_mc.\n\nThe effect is a slight improvement of the performance but, from the HLT point of view, there is a large increase of efficiency and trigger rate.\nIn the next DIGI-RECO campaign in 76X we want to simulate the trigger as close as possible to the real trigger used in data (in 74X). It means that we want to move back to the online b-taggin to the old training (while the offline b-tagging will continue to use the new training).\n\nThis PR adapts the HLT configuration in 76X to use the old b-tag training.\nThe code will work _only_ on 75X_mcRun2_asymptotic_v9 and later (we need BTauGenericMVAJetTagComputerRcd=MVAComputerContainer_75X_JetTags_v3_mc).\n\nSo please approve the PR only when the the new GT will be available.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1445876751", "comments": 31, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1445581637", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "hlt-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 12062, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Use old b-tag training at HLT in 76X", "updated_at": "1445876751", "user": "silviodonato"}

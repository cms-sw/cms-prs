However, the index used was one into\nthe edm::RefVector but the constructor requires the index to be back\nto the original collection to which the edm::RefVector associates.\nThe only way the associator ever worked correctly was when the edm::RefVector\nused contained entries for every item in the original collection.\nThe problematic edm::Ref constructor will be removed in another commit.\nThis problem was found by David Dagenhart.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 11, "closed_at": "1422616875", "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1422561424", "deletions": 158, "labels": ["comparison-available", "new-package-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "699f9ea22dd92f4461fe40ce1f443716de725860", "merged_at": "1422616875", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 7463, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Remove improper call to edm::Ref constructor call", "updated_at": "1424891683", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

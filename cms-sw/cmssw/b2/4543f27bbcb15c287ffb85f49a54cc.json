Available are ['FH_DR_GROUP', 'SusyPostProcessorSequence',  ....] \r\n```\r\n(message is stripped, it is several hundred lines long, see e.g. [here](https://cmssdt.cern.ch/SDT/cgi-bin/buildlogs/slc7_amd64_gcc700/CMSSW_11_0_X_2019-07-19-2300/pyRelValMatrixLogs/run/7.2_Cosmics_UP18+Cosmics_UP18+DIGICOS_UP18+RECOCOS_UP18+ALCACOS_UP18+HARVESTCOS_UP18/step5_Cosmics_UP18+Cosmics_UP18+DIGICOS_UP18+RECOCOS_UP18+ALCACOS_UP18+HARVESTCOS_UP18.log) ).\r\nWhile apparently the cosmics workflows are running successfully, even the HARVESTING step,  it is not clear to me what exactly is being run.\r\nAt any rate I've traced the issue in the lack of definition of the sequence `dqmHarvestingFakeHLT` in \r\n `Configuration/StandardSequences/python/HarvestingCosmics_cff.py` which is now created removing the HLT monitoring clients which cannot meaningfully in absence of an HLT menu.\r\nAs a side comment, I tried to remove the offending sequences via:\r\n```python\r\nDQMOfflineCosmics_SecondStep_FakeHLT = cms.Sequence(DQMOfflineCosmics_SecondStep)\r\nDQMOfflineCosmics_SecondStep_FakeHLT.remove(triggerOfflineDQMClient)\r\nDQMOfflineCosmics_SecondStep_FakeHLT.remove(hltOfflineDQMClient)\r\n```\r\ne.g. as proposed here: https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/27467/files#diff-8660299b2ade38cf3638eb31ccb685f6R104 but this appears not to work. I would be curious to understand what is the most economic approach.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nPasses tests of a real data and 2018 Cosmics MC workflows:\r\n```\r\nrunTheMatrix.py -l 4.22,7.2 --ibeos \r\n```\r\nand inspection of the harvesting step logs shows lack of warning messages. \r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\nThis PR is not a backport.\r\ncc:\r\n\r\n@mtosi \r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1563863717", "comments": 12, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1563617575", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "operations-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "7310d8a2e8358685ac8f837ed1d32f1c49beb2ac", "merged_at": "1563863717", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27576, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "add DQMOfflineCosmics_SecondStep_FakeHLT for Cosmics harvesting", "updated_at": "1563863717", "user": "mmusich"}

LEDTask is added to the hcalcalib application. Plots are added to LaserTask, LEDTask, and DigiTask, to monitor both the detector channels (e.g. timing) and the dedicated laser and LED monitoring channels (LaserMon PMT, and LED calibration channels). \r\n\r\nA few improvements to the HCAL DQM infrastructure are also included:\r\n- Add option for folding in overflow bins.\r\n- Have the TProfile containers implement their own fill methods, instead of just inheriting from TH1.\r\n- The ElectronicsMap class accounts for the fact that HcalDetId sometimes changed the rawId (\"newForm\").\r\n- Add coarse luminosity axis (e.g. 10 LS binning).\r\n- Add RBX axis.\r\n- Fix a few mistakes where the wrong quantity was being filled in plots.\r\n ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 31, "comments": 13, "commits": 33, "created_at": "1524134801", "deletions": 216, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "dqm-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 23005, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "HCALDQM: Add monitoring of LED and laser in global runs (10_2_X)", "updated_at": "1524216965", "user": "DryRun"}

While technically usable by producers, this parameter was not used in the past and not represented in the fillDescriptions. In recent trigger studies, it is needed.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the part of fillDescriptions that refers to the qualityCuts and was present in several producers is moved to the RecoTauQualityCuts class and now imported and shared by the producers.\r\n\r\nSome deprecated helper functions are removed from the RecoTauQualityCuts class.\r\n\r\nThis is only a technical change and no changes to physics results are expected.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n- compiles\r\n- code checks pass\r\n- format checks pass\r\n- unit tests pass\r\n- limited matrix tests pass\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 11, "closed_at": "1593796456", "comments": 14, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1593074954", "deletions": 535, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "0fdb1ad68256036eaeff4f0b6e43ff41c3b3bd98", "merged_at": "1593796456", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 30364, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "Revision of tau quality cut configuration", "updated_at": "1593796456", "user": "swozniewski"}

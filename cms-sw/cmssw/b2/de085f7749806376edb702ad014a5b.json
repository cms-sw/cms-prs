In a couple of places in L1Trigger/TrackFindingTracklet, the binary op was modifying the running value argument, which isn't necessary, doesn't conform to the preferred function signature, and breaks in c++20 because it isn't an rvalue.  This PR fixes those compilation problems in the CPP20 builds and removes a few C-style casts.\r\n\r\nIn addition, in LTO builds we get a warning\r\n```\r\nIn function '_S_ref',\r\n    inlined from 'operator[]' at /data/cmsbld/jenkins/workspace/build-any-ib/w/el8_amd64_gcc12/external/gcc/12.3.1-40d504be6370b5a30e3947a6e575ca28/include/c++/12.3.1/array:219:25,\r\n    inlined from 'benddecode' at /data/cmsbld/jenkins/workspace/build-any-ib/w/tmp/BUILDROOT/d190cc84d43df9162e76772777821e0e/opt/cmssw/el8_amd64_gcc12/cms/cmssw/CMSSW_14_0_X_2024-01-01-2300/src/L1Trigger/TrackFindingTracklet/interface/Settings.h:446:42,\r\n    inlined from 'initBendMatch' at /data/cmsbld/jenkins/workspace/build-any-ib/w/tmp/BUILDROOT/d190cc84d43df9162e76772777821e0e/opt/cmssw/el8_amd64_gcc12/cms/cmssw/CMSSW_14_0_X_2024-01-01-2300/src/L1Trigger/TrackFindingTracklet/src/TrackletLUT.cc:955:42:\r\n  /data/cmsbld/jenkins/workspace/build-any-ib/w/el8_amd64_gcc12/external/gcc/12.3.1-40d504be6370b5a30e3947a6e575ca28/include/c++/12.3.1/array:61:36: warning: array subscript 18446744071562067968 is above array bounds of 'const struct array[16]' [-Warray-bounds]\r\n    61 |       { return const_cast<_Tp&>(__t[__n]); }\r\n      |                                    ^\r\n/data/cmsbld/jenkins/workspace/build-any-ib/w/tmp/BUILDROOT/d190cc84d43df9162e76772777821e0e/opt/cmssw/el8_amd64_gcc12/cms/cmssw/CMSSW_14_0_X_2024-01-01-2300/src/L1Trigger/TrackFindingTracklet/interface/TrackletLUT.h: In member function 'initBendMatch':\r\n/data/cmsbld/jenkins/workspace/build-any-ib/w/tmp/BUILDROOT/d190cc84d43df9162e76772777821e0e/opt/cmssw/el8_amd64_gcc12/cms/cmssw/CMSSW_14_0_X_2024-01-01-2300/src/L1Trigger/TrackFindingTracklet/interface/TrackletLUT.h:120:21: note: while referencing 'settings_'\r\n  120 |     const Settings& settings_;\r\n      |                     ^\r\n```\r\nThis appears to be a false positive, where the LTO optimizer is concluding that it's possible a -1 could be passed to an unsigned and thus interpreted as a very large value.

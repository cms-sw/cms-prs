In principle any bit set in quality mask would be enough, but in practice this means `loose` (so there is no mechanism to select also those tracks whose quality mask is empty).\r\n\r\nTested in 9_3_0_pre3, no changes expected in standard workflows.\r\n\r\n@rovere @VinInn ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1503351554", "comments": 10, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1503056459", "deletions": 11, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "ae572244b85028a9e21476914596c6b5a13e5e27", "merged_at": "1503351554", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_3_X", "number": 20207, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fixes to TrackCollectionMerger", "updated_at": "1503351554", "user": "makortel"}

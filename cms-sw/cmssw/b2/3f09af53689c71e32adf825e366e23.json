It allocates the shared_ptr and the pointee in the same allocation.\r\nThis PR changes the places in visualization that did it the suboptimal way. To do this, it was necessary to replace the use of boost::shared_ptr with std::shared_ptr, which was done throughout visualization.", "branch": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "changed_files": 54, "closed_at": "1480276891", "comments": 10, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1480118726", "deletions": 138, "labels": ["comparison-notrun", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "tests-approved", "visualization-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "e46d222b5b2fcac5912679b126c5f4128e20ff56", "merged_at": "1480276891", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "number": 16768, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Use make_shared in visualization", "updated_at": "1480303319", "user": "wmtan"}

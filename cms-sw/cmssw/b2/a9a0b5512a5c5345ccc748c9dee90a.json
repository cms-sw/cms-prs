The goal is reproducibility. The updates are:\r\n\r\n1. Set seeds at the beginning\r\n1. Set seed in the pair-making threads\r\n1. Don't use `as_completed`, which has non-deterministic order of the threads\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI ran the notebooks a handful of times, and the results don't change after the updates. Chatgpt and gemini also approve of the approach.\r\n\r\ncc @GNiendorf @slava77 ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 3, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1751235353", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "tracking"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 48442, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "LST notebooks for neural network training: make training reproducible", "updated_at": "1751235692", "user": "alexandertuna"}

The electron cutBased and photon cutBased and MVA IDs (and new EA corrections for isolation) added in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/39963, https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/39927, https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/40045 did not follow the same convention for Run2 and Run3. This restores consistency by:\r\n   - Run2: only provide Fall17V2-based IDs and isos with the \"default\" names (`cutBased`/`mvaID`/...)\r\n   - Run3: provide the Winter22V1-based IDs with the \"default\" names (`cutBased`/`mvaID`/...), but keep the Fall17V2 variables with a `_Fall17V2` suffix as backup, as desired by @cms-sw/egamma-pog-l2  . Those should be dropped at some point later.\r\n3. The electron+photon scale+smearing corrections are not available yet for Run3; the Run2 ones should not be applied for Run3 eras but the energy should be left uncorrected; Run3 corrections will be made available later with correctionlib.\r\n   - This required excluding the `run2_egamma_2018` modifier from the `Run3` era, since it was carried over there from the `Run2_2018` era. From a quick search it seems this should not have unexpected effects elsewhere.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n`runTheMatrix.py --what nano --site \"\" -l 2500.312,2500.501`\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

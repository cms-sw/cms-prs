Since the ID functionality was more urgent than the rest of the development, it was decided to backport the Photon IDs and the PhotonIDValueMapProducer speedup separately from the rest in this PR: https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/25372.\r\n\r\nWhat remains here is the backport of the other developments, which are in fact useful for analyses: updated PhotonMVANtuplizer, reduced memory usage, speed and FWlite compatibility for the electron MVAs.\r\n\r\nThis PR builds on top of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/25372 and should only be tested and reviewed when that one is merged.", "branch": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "changed_files": 43, "closed_at": "1543907233", "comments": 29, "commits": 23, "created_at": "1542804740", "deletions": 1129, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-rejected", "requires-external", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 25313, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "[10_2_X] Syncing Egamma ID code with 10_4_X", "updated_at": "1544033809", "user": "guitargeek"}

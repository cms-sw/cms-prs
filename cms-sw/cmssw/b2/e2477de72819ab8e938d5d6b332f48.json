ROOT 5 still works because it has looser checking for these things,\n1)  One class has a dictionary defined in two different xml files.  This fix comments out the duplicate in this file.\n(this fix is already in ROOT 6)\n2) the data member \"transientVector_\" of the AssociationVector template is transient, but this dictionary fails to declare it as transient for some AssociationVector template instances.\nThis fix will fix a failure in 22 ROOT 6 relvals.\n\nThis pull request has been tested in the 7_1_X branch (ROOT 5) with the short relval matrix, and all tests pass with no errors.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1392357169", "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1392235957", "deletions": 14, "labels": ["fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "7d1024949ff2e50595df4f3433ea7f139fd40e0e", "merged_at": "1392357169", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_1_0_pre5", "number": 2434, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "transientVector_ must be declared transient", "updated_at": "1402657360", "user": "wmtan"}

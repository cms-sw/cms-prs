Padding bytes (0xff) can be appended after the end of each event or INIT message. Intention is to add them at the end of the file (4096-byte blocks) to round the file size so it is compatible with O_DIRECT copy from DAQ RUBUs to Lustre system in hope this will reduce deadtime issues seen recently.\r\n\r\nStreamer Input sources will automatically detect padding which will (typically) be appended to streams transferred to Tier-0. Also an option was added to generate files which contain padding after each event or INI object.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nUnit test was added to generate and read padded streamer file. In addition it was manually tested with standard merged streamer files in CDAQ, as well as new padded ones that are created in the DAQ test system.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 16, "comments": 12, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1679431479", "deletions": 67, "labels": ["core-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-rejected", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_1_X", "number": 41125, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 13, "state": "open", "title": "(13_1_X) streamer format padding", "updated_at": "1679579118", "user": "smorovic"}

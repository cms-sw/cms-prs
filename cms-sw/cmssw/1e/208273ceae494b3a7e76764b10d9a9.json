Also tweak some lines in test/plottingTools.\r\n- Added a new plotting tool to allow for creation of plots with residual distributions plus some other validation plots.\r\n- Added an option to autoSubmitter, so that APE can be more easily measured on cosmics data sets.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRan some basic tests of the code on the most recent APE campaign to confirm that the changes work as intended.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 10, "closed_at": "1628897627", "comments": 18, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1628601947", "deletions": 23, "labels": ["alca-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "7b0f8cd18d5b076f65d3cc403bed95e626b13aee", "merged_at": "1628897627", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "number": 34828, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Validation plots for APE and bug fixes", "updated_at": "1628897627", "user": "mteroerd"}

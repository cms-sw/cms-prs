It includes following modifications:\r\n1)   suppressed number of Geant4 repeated warning messages by limit 20\r\n2)   introduced a new parameter G4TrackingCut for all charged particles, Geant4 default 1 keV\r\n3)   it is possible to increase this value inside g4SimHits configuration, for 20 keV SIM step speed-up for ttbar is ~1%, for MinBias events ~10% \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nprivate\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

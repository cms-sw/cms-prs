Then they can be run in any order (respecting data dependencies) without constraints from the Sequence ordering (fixing \"unrunnable schedule), and not run if there are no consumers (fixing `ProductNotFound` errors in 1325.X).\r\n\r\n(*)\r\n```\r\nAn exception of category 'ProductNotFound' occurred while\r\n   [0] Processing  Event run: 1 lumi: 19 event: 1802 stream: 1\r\n   [1] Running path 'prevalidation_step'\r\n   [2] Calling method for module CITKPFIsolationSumProducer/'egmElectronIsolationCITK'\r\nException Message:\r\nPrincipal::getByToken: Found zero products matching all criteria\r\nLooking for a container with elements of type: reco::Candidate\r\nLooking for module label: gedGsfElectronsTmp\r\nLooking for productInstanceName: \r\n```\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nLimited matrix and workflows `1325.5,1325.51,1325.516,1325.5161,1325.517,1325.518` run.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1591439509", "comments": 18, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1591183797", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["bug-fix", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "operations-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved", "urgent"], "merge_commit_sha": "751ebbda64ea0b8cf8c0e4f6c5e45b740bf0ae7d", "merged_at": "1591439509", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 30094, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Move EDProducers to Task from electron MiniAOD validation sequence", "updated_at": "1591439510", "user": "makortel"}

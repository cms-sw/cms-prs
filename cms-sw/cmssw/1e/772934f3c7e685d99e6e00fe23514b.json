The reading capability of a ```TDirectory``` based ROOT file is enabled in the LegacyIOHelper and that is used by the ```SiStripOfflineDQM``` module. In addition, this PR adds a unit test for the offline TkMap creation. \r\nThanks to @mmusich for debugging several aspects of the changes. Some bug fixes for some of the TkMaps are expected which can come as a separate PR later.\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe updates have been tested privately and Tracker Maps are getting produced with DQM harvested root file as an input.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\nBackport will be done for 11_3 and 12_0.

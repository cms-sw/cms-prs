This DNN is similar to the one currently in LST used to reject fake T5 objects, but has a multi-class output to predict if a track is fake, real and displaced, or real and prompt. I place cuts on the prompt and displaced categories to reject **60%** of fake T3's at build-time without reducing the displaced track efficiency of LST significantly. This large reduction in fake T3's provides significant timing improvements for LST. For the low-pT config of LST it reduces the single-stream time by 16%. The track candidate FR of LST also decreases slightly, although most of these fake T3's are already rejected downstream, so the performance plots only change marginally. \r\n\r\nI include the notebook used to train the T3 DNN in the standalone part of the LST code, where the T5 DNN training notebook is also currently present.\r\n\r\nMore information about the changes in this PR (performance plots, detailed timing, etc.) can be found here: [PR_144.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19324154/PR_144.pdf)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe code has been tested locally: it compiles and gives the identical results (on CPU) for LST.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 10, "comments": 10, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1742315086", "deletions": 114, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "heterogeneous-pending", "tracking"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 47618, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Add DNN to Reject Fake T3 Objects in LST", "updated_at": "1742467369", "user": "GNiendorf"}

This depends\non a single global static ParameterSetID.\nIt fails when used in SubProcesses would return\nthe ParameterSet for the wrong process/SubProcess.\nThe bug only affects jobs with SubProcesses.\nThis global was also problematic for multithreading\n(had to be protected with a mutex).\n\nMore changes will follow this to convert\nall uses of the old function to an alternative\nand then eventually to delete it. Merging this\nPR quickly will make it easier to test the others\nquickly.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1434600845", "comments": 10, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1434567510", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["comparison-available", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "39039055473ef46c3e5da1d32cef7792ab16be34", "merged_at": "1434600845", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 9662, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Bug fix.

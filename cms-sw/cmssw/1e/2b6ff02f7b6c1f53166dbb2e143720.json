Ok, this cleanup should have been done anyway as the CA quadruplets is the default for both phase1 and phase2.\r\n\r\nTested in CMSSW_9_3_X_2017-07-13-1100, should have no physics impact.\r\n\r\n@rovere @VinInn ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1500480318", "comments": 19, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1500019550", "deletions": 137, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "e332c1da3835abea2691b6ce30994ec42f1a844d", "merged_at": "1500480318", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_3_X", "number": 19738, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Cleanup pixel tracking configurations", "updated_at": "1500573036", "user": "makortel"}

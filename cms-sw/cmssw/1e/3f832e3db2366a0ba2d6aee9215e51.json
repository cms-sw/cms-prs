It is a direct follow-up of the refinement implemented in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/48587#issuecomment-3151196024. \r\n\r\nThe only expected changes to DQM are to PuppiMET_pt and PuppiMET_phi. \r\n\r\nThe PR creates additional backup branches: PuppiMET_pt_unrefined and PuppiMET_phi_unrefined in case anything goes wrong with the refined jets in some unanticipated corner of phase space.

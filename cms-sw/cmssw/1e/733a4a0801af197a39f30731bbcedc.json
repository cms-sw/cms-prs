Apparently the error-messages looks similar, but they needed different fixes. To fix this particular crash, we need some extra protection against edge-cases, in `GsfTrajectorySmoother`. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nChecked that the reported crash in run `361971` gets solved.\r\n`runTheMatrix.py -l 12434.0` ran fine.\r\n\r\nI intend to backport it to 12_4_X and 12_5_X soon.

Bug fix in ConversionTools; one function call was missing a parameter.\n\nOn line 313 the call:\nhasMatchedConversion(*it,convCol,beamspot,lxyMin,probMin,nHitsBeforeVtxMax)\nWhen *it is a reco::GsfElectron (L305), the called function is \ndefined in line 51-52 of the header.\nThe function prototype for this version, expects the 4th argument to be \n\"bool allowCkfMatch\" but in the function call this parameter is missing \n(or, rather, the value of lxyMin is passed in this spot). \nSince \"float\" can be cast to \"bool\" and \"unsigned int\" can be cast to \"float\", \nit will compile but the behavior will not be what is expected.\n\nAfter the fix we expect to see slightly more photons not passing the electron veto i.e. passElectronVeto()==0\n(in gamma+Jet sample I see the percentage going from 7.7% to 8.0%).\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1424937135", "comments": 10, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1424763946", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "ede9384e4dadfb40b1d4346afbefba3b3b34e5c6", "merged_at": "1424937135", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 7918, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "bugfix for ConversionTools", "updated_at": "1432835858", "user": "matteosan1"}

All basic tests on my side are passing.\r\n   * This PR depends on [external data](https://github.com/cms-data/RecoBTag-Combined/pull/4) being available in the IB.\r\n   * @slava77 suggested memory and CPU footprint checks, I was hoping jenkins would take care of it.\r\n   * We would like to back-port this PR (disabling the changes to the RECO format) once this is approved. Can I already make a backport PR?", "branch": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "changed_files": 24, "closed_at": "1486655302", "comments": 63, "commits": 23, "created_at": "1485164670", "deletions": 19, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "c223087b461c24f4d6ea68fdaec5c76b6df747b6", "merged_at": "1486655302", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "number": 17247, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 13, "state": "closed", "title": "Deep flavour PR", "updated_at": "1486655302", "user": "mverzett"}

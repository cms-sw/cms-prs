Clean up 'drop' not really used in RecoParticleFlow. We use `7 'keep commands'` with specific label names(L28-34) instead of `'drop recoPFCandidates_particleFlowTmp__*',`.\r\n\r\nIn RecoParticleFlowAOD(L38-47), there is a `'drop *_pfElectronTranslator_*_*',` and some `'keep reco*_pfElectronTranslator_*_*',`` 'keep reco*_pfPhotonTranslator_*_*',` that need check from experts more clearly.\r\nFor current runTheMatrix outputs don't have `pf*Translator` in any (AOD/RECO/FEVT) event content. \r\nSo please check this pf*Translator really use or need in AOD event content.\r\n\r\n(The previous tasks are [PR#29025](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/29025), [PR#29158](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/29158), [PR#29225](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/29225), and [PR#29299](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/29299).)\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nEvent Content comparison check was also done and there is no change with these updates.\r\nTested in CMSSW_11_1_X, the basic test all passed in the [CMSSW PR instructions](https://cms-sw.github.io/PRWorkflow.html).", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1588050455", "comments": 27, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1586826757", "deletions": 213, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "b3d42e1d090033076aec4580d2395837867124e6", "merged_at": "1588050455", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 29470, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 5, "state": "closed", "title": "Update RecoParticleFlow eventcontent format and remove drop", "updated_at": "1588050455", "user": "jeongeun"}

Workflows are exactly the same as the normal Extended2023HGCalMuon except that this customisation function is used:\n\n```\nRecoParticleFlow/PandoraTranslator/customizeHGCalPandora_cff.cust_2023HGCalPandoraMuon\n```\n\nNumbers are 156xx for 0 pileup; and 158xx for 140 pileup.\nAlso fixed some whitespace.\n\n@boudoul, I'd be interested if you have a better way of implementing this.  I just replicated the Extended2023HGCalMuon workflows and changed the customisation function.  There is obviously a lot of duplication so perhaps you have a better solution?\nAlso, I wasn't sure if some of the older workflows could be replaced, so played it safe and added new ones.\n\n@vandreev11, @pfs, @lgray, @sethzenz, @kpedro88\n", "branch": "CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1425292314", "comments": 6, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1425053024", "deletions": 18, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "3399b15d12c827b73a639bd4d06c9ed4cd3cbe1b", "merged_at": "1425292314", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "number": 7993, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add workflows to reconstruct HGCal using PandoraPFA", "updated_at": "1425369883", "user": "mark-grimes"}

Heavy Ions needs this information during the pp reference run in order to do proper comparisons to PbPb results, where this information will be used for photon ID.\n\nIt will add two instances of the HIPhotonIsolation ValueMap, one for \"std\" photons and another for GED photons to the RECO and AOD event content for pp events.\nThis is urgent, as the pp reference run is approaching soon.\n\nAs pointed by @slava77  in the RECO meeting on 29.10.2015, this PR is planned to go into 75X.\n\nUpon feedback on the previous PR, this PR implements \"customisation\" approach.\n\n@richard-cms \n@yenjie\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1446697587", "comments": 21, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1446144383", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "fde88cb728ffb3b329808ef1be60b0b06ce1981c", "merged_at": "1446697587", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 12185, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "pp RECO with HI photon isolation using \"customise\" option", "updated_at": "1446697587", "user": "ttrk"}

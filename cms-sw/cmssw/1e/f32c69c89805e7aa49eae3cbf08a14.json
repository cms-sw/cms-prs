The updated consists of\r\n* values of a set of MVA input parameters are constrained against unphysical outliers (key change for the new MVA training),\r\n* making `usePhiAtEcalEntranceExtrapolation` parameter an internal parameter of the MVA algorithm to which it belongs rather than of the producer which calls the algorithm,\r\n* a few other fixes to the code, e.g. range-based loops, a modern pointer instead of bare C pointer, etc.\r\n\r\nThe changes are not expected to change result, i.e. returned value of the MVA anti-e tau discriminant (together with related WPs) with the current training, or the changes will be marginal, i.e. below precision of performed tests with ~100k of ZLL (L=e,mu,tau) events.\r\n\r\nA PR with additional changes in configuration files to introduce the new training will be send when the training fully validated and related payloads loaded to CondDB.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1539368391", "comments": 11, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1538640130", "deletions": 150, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "7b5f29cdb8385ac8b427d4b6624868a706c1b61d", "merged_at": "1539368391", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_4_X", "number": 24800, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "Update anti-e tau discriminant", "updated_at": "1539368391", "user": "mbluj"}

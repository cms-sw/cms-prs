It was checked that all newly added dependencies are actually required by the package with `git grep`.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 57, "closed_at": "1599868561", "comments": 36, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1599325817", "deletions": 104, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "7a603d5fba6b4e8df9d8459e1e47967b89f32000", "merged_at": "1599868560", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 31368, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Clean BuildFiles in Geometry", "updated_at": "1599868561", "user": "guitargeek"}

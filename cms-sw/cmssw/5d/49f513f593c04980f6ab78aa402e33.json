We have introduced a new EcalMonitorTask called GpuTask designed to take in CPU and GPU generated rec hits and produce plots comparing several rec hit quantities for each run. We don't explicitly plot the GPU rec hit values for the sake of memory efficiency. Additional plots may be added in the future.\r\n\r\nThis task will not run by default on the regular Online DQM workflow.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nOne caveat to this version of the code is that we have not been able to test it on actual GPU rec hits. There appears to be no workflow currently that produces both types of rec hit collections. We have been informed by Thomas Reis that CPU and GPU ECAL rec hits are the same data type, so our testing is done by changing the input tags so that both collections are the CPU rec hits.\r\n\r\nThis code was run with the runTheMatrix workflow 10842.512 and the new plots look as expected.\r\n\r\n[GPU-enabled collections]: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pCbC-PU2LJMpWK9JxYrRIjpKXMH_QG47py5joFImiAQ/edit#slide=id.gf6f43175a4_0_11\r\n\r\nA backport to 12_1_X is submitted here https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/35947", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 7, "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1635799585", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-rejected", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_2_X", "number": 35946, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Create new ECAL DQM GpuTask to monitor and compare CPU and GPU generated ECAL Rec Hits", "updated_at": "1635871491", "user": "alejands"}

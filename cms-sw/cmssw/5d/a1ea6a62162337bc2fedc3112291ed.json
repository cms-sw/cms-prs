The large number corresponds to:\r\n[all analyses] * [all triggers] * [all object types] * [all plot types]\r\n\r\nI reduced the strings by only using the actual analysis-trigger combinations, rather than compiling all of the triggers into a single giant list. I also moved the creation of the postprocessors to functions, e.g. `make_exo_postprocessor()`.\r\n\r\nFor Exotica and SMP, the changes were relatively trivial, but hltHiggsPostProcessors_cff.py was much more involved... the lists used in the `for` loops were repeated re-initialized and appended to at random points in the code, making it very difficult to figure out what was going on. I ran some runTheMatrix tests to make sure I didn't accidentally remove any plots, but this might merit more scrutiny. Feedback would be welcome, if anyone has a suggestion for how to do this systematically.

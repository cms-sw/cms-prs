This avoids threading problems when running with multiple events. It also makes the threading jobs more efficient.\nAlso converted SiStripClusterToDigiProducer to stream since it appears to be safe to do so (static analyzer gives it a clean bill of health).\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1400073599", "comments": 4, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1400071119", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "34f85390c3dc86b1d556c6127a28011d4990aca0", "merged_at": "1400073599", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_1_0_pre8", "number": 3866, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Make SiStripClusterizer prods stream modules", "updated_at": "1403487190", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

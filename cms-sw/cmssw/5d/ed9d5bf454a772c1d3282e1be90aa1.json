Replace the ratio between corrected & uncorrected energy in Run 2 NanoAOD with the uncorrected energy itself (to avoid issues like #46046 - if the correction is 0, we cannot recover the energy before applying the correction using the ratio).\r\n\r\n2. Currently, EGM still relies on AOD to derive central reco SFs. This is because the supercluster (SC) collection stored in MiniAOD is highly biased since we only store the SC that already reconstructed electron & photon objects. This PR attempts to improve the situation by migrating from the legacy AOD-based workflow to the (EGM) nanoAOD-based workflow. A minimal change in miniAOD is required to remove the biases implied in the current miniAOD.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe expected increase in miniAOD file size is marginal - from 0.07% for clean events (e.g. DY) to 0.44% for busy events (e.g. TTto4Q) when tested with 1k events. The increase in EGM nanoAOD due to the new SC collection is 1.16% in DY and 1.7% in TTto2L2Nu, again tested with 1k events (as of Winter24 samples).\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nNo backport is needed (this PR targets Nano v15).", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 13, "comments": 22, "commits": 10, "created_at": "1729163131", "deletions": 11, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "xpog-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_2_X", "number": 46423, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "open", "title": "Adding unbiased superclusters to miniAOD and EGM nano", "updated_at": "1729580904", "user": "SanghyunKo"}

In addition, it is useful to view these events in a wider time window than the default configuration. This PR changes the timing windows and removes a chi-square constraint to make DQM more useful during splash events. This also adds an option `options.BeamSplashRun` to the ecal dqm client config to activate splash run mode in DQM, following the comment https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/35734#issuecomment-946966467\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nValidated by the standard Ecal DQM configuration by manually setting options.BeamSplashRun to True and False and comparing the output plots. Results look as expected.\r\n\r\nThis PR is a forward port of the PR https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/35747 made to the production version 12_0_X, so that they are in sync.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1634810051", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1634747117", "deletions": 13, "labels": ["dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "0e1ee6a757a7f80dbb7df0854af0a8900a836364", "merged_at": "1634810051", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "number": 35755, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Changes to accommodate Splash events", "updated_at": "1634810051", "user": "abhih1"}

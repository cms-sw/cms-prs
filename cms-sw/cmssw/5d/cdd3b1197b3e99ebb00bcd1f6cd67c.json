This is the last in a series of pull requests simplifying some interfaces internal to the Framework with the TransitionInfo class. The main goal is to make the code more readable and understandable. It shouldn't affect output or performance. This one is focused on the interfaces from the Worker down into the module base classes.\r\n\r\nI am not aware of anything controversial in the one.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThere should be no change in behavior or output. This relies on existing tests.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 58, "closed_at": "1601474107", "comments": 28, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1601042982", "deletions": 1034, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "b356d45847ac75fc5b3e7c9d5c9f5beaf821228a", "merged_at": "1601474107", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 31584, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 8, "state": "closed", "title": "Use TransitionInfo in more interfaces (more)", "updated_at": "1601474108", "user": "wddgit"}

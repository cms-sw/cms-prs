Pushed from 13_2_0_pre2.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nSame as linked original PR below. Verified using `scram build code-check` and `scram build code-format`. Seem to be a couple of minor indentation changes in lines unrelated to the actual TopRecoilHook in Pythia8Hadronizer.cc as a result of the code-format tool.  All differences between original PR are to account for CMSSW_13_2_X formatting needs.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nOriginal PR found [here](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/42180).

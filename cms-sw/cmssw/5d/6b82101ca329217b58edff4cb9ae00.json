Note that the command is also still in the helper function, taking it out now would conflict with #7729 and having it twice is not harmful (the changes to postLS1Customs.py here are removing old commands, and these changes are common to the two PRs).\n\nTesting has been limited, although there are no changes unless the `run2` era is explicitly activated.  I just made sure everything parses and the particular changes take effect.  I'll do full comparisons between the customisation and era output once all the pull requests are in.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1423916703", "comments": 6, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1423850966", "deletions": 58, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "cc38862b6c37e682373b7f9b2cc0ddade0239000", "merged_at": "1423916703", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 7730, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add DQM commands to the run2 era", "updated_at": "1423916862", "user": "mark-grimes"}

The two PRs are not mutually exclusive (in principle, both could be integrated).\r\n\r\nIn this PR, a check is added to `LayerMeasurements` in order to skip `TrajectoryStateOnSurface` objects whose global position is well outside the detector volume. The rationale of this check was discussed in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/40174#issuecomment-1640703758.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nManual checks with the reproducers in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/40174#issuecomment-1598702425 and https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/40174#issuecomment-1625219782.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

(it is WIP to put them directly in RECO)\n\nExpected changes in electron and photon energies in AOD.\nWe are validating the Z-peak and E/E_true on 76X relvals, we will post plots here.\n\n@matteosan1 Use this branch for tests, you'll need to start from CMSSW_7_6_X_2015-09-16-2300 IB.\n@ikrav This (as it is right now) breaks VID-by value, but not the more standard use cases. I'll fix it in a later PR.\n\n@bendavid @gpetruc \n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 26, "closed_at": "1442564933", "comments": 6, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1442482905", "deletions": 444, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-rejected"], "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 11318, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 14, "state": "closed", "title": "Electron and Photon Regressions in RECO (76X)", "updated_at": "1442576145", "user": "lgray"}

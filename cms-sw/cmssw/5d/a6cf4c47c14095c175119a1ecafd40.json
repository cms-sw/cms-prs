Unfortunately, the file was\nwritten so long ago that ROOT's schema for the classes has changed. This is a problem for the\nthreaded framework since ROOT 5 updates schema in a thread-unsafe manner when it opens\na file and sees a new-to-it schema. By creating a new file containing the same information\nwe can successfully preload the new class schemas (since they match the C++ code) at job\ninitialization time.\nROOT 6 is supposed to fix this problem.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_THREADED_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1388576063", "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1388412000", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "bd8a4912b7ce85e7e9f3e222fd0ea1506d7bfc2d", "merged_at": "1388576063", "merged_by": "ktf", "number": 1930, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Updated file to newer ROOT format", "updated_at": "1388764998", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

The indices of the lt_sortedindices vector correspond to the indices of the original collection (e.g. LTs collection), however in the second for loop, the lt_sortedindices is accessed using the index of the lt_sorted vector (which has been trimmed and is smaller than the LTs collection). To get back the correct index to access the elements of the lt_sortedindices one should use the \"get()\" function from the lt_sorted vector, which returns the index of the LTs collection.\r\n\r\n@SWuchterl @DickyChant\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested locally by comparing the features produced by the CMSSW producer to those used by the b-hive inference.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

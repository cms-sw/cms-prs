The main difference between AOD and miniAOD is that in miniAOD a subset of GenParticles is stored in the following two collections:\n- `prunedGenParticles`\n- `packedGenParticles`\n\nand InputGenJetsParticleSelector needs to access both collections in order to perform the same selection of GenParticles as in AOD where all GenParticles are stored in one collection, `genParticles`. Attached are a few comparison plots. Small differences between AOD and miniAOD are expected due to the loss of precision in the GenParticle (un)packing process.\n\n![genjetscomparison_1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4885289/4550513/562a2bd6-4e67-11e4-8891-3c4f62e97f3c.png)\n![genjetscomparison_2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4885289/4550515/562f9b52-4e67-11e4-9c15-ccfbeaadfa75.png)\n![genjetscomparison_3](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4885289/4550512/5629c13c-4e67-11e4-801f-34b36c14573b.png)\n![genjetscomparison_4](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4885289/4550514/562cb7c0-4e67-11e4-813a-134129c6ba68.png)\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_2_X", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1413360322", "comments": 22, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1412709566", "deletions": 34, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "ffc3e9a1c20dc6dc56bf8b6a55908ee77ae9440d", "merged_at": "1413360322", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_2_X", "number": 5731, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 4, "state": "closed", "title": "MiniAOD for InputGenJetsParticleSelector", "updated_at": "1413382452", "user": "ferencek"}

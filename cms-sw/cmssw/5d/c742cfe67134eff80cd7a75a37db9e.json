The ZDC is not incorporated fully into CMSSW and therefore this has no impact on analysis. Additionally, an era modifier has been implemented such that the ZDC digitization can be re-implemented for special cases in the event that it is needed. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe PR validation is documented in this [dropbox paper](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/qh9hj2l1vdmy4i2f5r865/Disabling-ZDC-Digitization.paper?rlkey=80q18mmkvr8j7rfwjpgk5kzwq&st=nfao3zvi&dl=0) and was tests using 2025 MC workflow. \r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nThis PR will be used to avoid errors in the 2025 MC workflow, so will need a backport to 15_1_X. \r\n\r\nTagging HIN colleagues: @mandrenguyen\r\nTagging HCAL colleagues:@abdoulline \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1765508539", "deletions": 7, "labels": ["simulation-pending", "operations-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_0_X", "number": 49612, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Disable ZDC digitization for simulation.", "updated_at": "1765508700", "user": "hjbossi"}

It was explicitly checked on a few events known to prefire that the boolean decisions are correct.  \r\n \r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that a backport to `13_3_X` is needed for future reNANO of 2022/2023 (?).  \r\n ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 14, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1700164510", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "xpog-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "number": 43306, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "L1FinalOR decision in BX-1 and -2 in NANOAOD ", "updated_at": "1700495306", "user": "lathomas"}

The replay doesn't seem to work in this case because we store the accumulated SimHits in the MTD premix.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 9, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1720618158", "deletions": 42, "labels": ["dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "mtd"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 45424, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "MTD Validation: update of the BTL SimHit validation", "updated_at": "1721180739", "user": "casarsa"}

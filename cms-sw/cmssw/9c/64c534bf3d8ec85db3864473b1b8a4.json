This rare cases of large decay range due boost of tau, D, B more frequently happens at 13 TeV.\n2) A fragment used for simulation of exotica has been revised and cleaned up according to 7_X_Y SIM.\nCustom Physics List printpout at initialisation is moved from debug to info and a bit cleaned up.\nGFlash is added to the list of processes in process enumeration table.\n3) New lumi monitors have small acceptance, so ordinary simulation is very ineffective. In this PR a new filter allowing selection of primary particles is added. By default this filter is not enabled, so no effect for mainstream production.\n4) changed HF SL for 2011-2012 reprocessing is taken out - will be in a separate PR\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "changed_files": 10, "closed_at": "1409899683", "comments": 20, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1409728327", "deletions": 94, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "0b9c51bb8e41d46c78d818867e4667ecc747cf1d", "merged_at": "1409899683", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "number": 5146, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "Backport of tau-decay bug fix and exotica tuning", "updated_at": "1409899684", "user": "civanch"}

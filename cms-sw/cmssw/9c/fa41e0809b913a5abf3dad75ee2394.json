It sets the showershapes to zero so that by default they pass, this makes things easier to build a trigger as it avoids having to OR the ECAL and HGCAL showershape filters (which likely eventually will be made into a single  filter but that is not for today). \r\n\r\nNo physics changes are expected, the change in behaviour is a crash is prevented for PhaseII\r\n\r\nBackports will follow to 11_1 and 11_2\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nPhaseII E/gamma HLT workflows do not crash. \r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1608125285", "comments": 18, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1607947670", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "hlt-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "cc1bce6a2fc92a4ee4532129a313890634d360fe", "merged_at": "1608125285", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 32469, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "EgHLT Phase-II showershape fix : 11_3_X", "updated_at": "1608125285", "user": "Sam-Harper"}

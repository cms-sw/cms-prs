Note that there is reduced functionality for MiniAODs, since some information about PF is not included in this format.\r\n\r\nThe calibrations have been tested, and @nurfikri89 has checked the configuration.\r\n\r\nI have gone through the checklist, and the code passes the tests, aside from some problems accessing input files.\r\n\r\nI am also tagging the PF conveners for reference: @ahinzmann @stahlleiton\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "comments": 1, "commits": 9, "created_at": "1764101921", "deletions": 288, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_0_X", "number": 49474, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "PF Offline DQM MiniAOD compatibility and jet calibration addition", "updated_at": "1764101950", "user": "jroloff"}

It consists of a one plot that prints out all the information stored in the payload.\r\n\r\nAlso - in .clang-format - doubled line cleaned up.\r\n \r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe code can be tested by a script CondCore/CTPPSPlugins/test/testDAQMapping.sh also created in the PR (it uses getPayloadData.py from CondCore/Utilities) - test checks whether the new plugin is properly added to PI software and therefore it generates proper output file.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\nNo backport.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1702246681", "deletions": 24, "labels": ["core-pending", "db-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "number": 43541, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 17, "state": "open", "title": "new PI plugin added for TotemDAQMapping class", "updated_at": "1702476755", "user": "Kszemka"}

In short, there a 10_6_X release is used for GEN, SIM, and DIGI steps, and 8_0_33_UL is used for the HLT step. The SIM step adds a product `std::vector<std::string>` that the HLT step is unable to read because the friendly class name (that is part of the TTree branch name) is different. The friendly class name for `vector<string>` in 8_0_X is currently `charcharstdchar_traitsstdbasic_strings`, which can not be used for persistent data products because of the underscore.\r\n\r\nAn alternative solution would be to redesign the workflow to give only the RAW input to the HLT step, and using two-file solution in the RECO step to read in DIGI and HLT outputs. I'm making a backport anyway in case it would be useful (since it was rather easy to do).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nLocal test of HLT step of https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSCOMPPR-22029 succeeds. `FWCore/Utilities` unit tests pass.", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1642117069", "comments": 28, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1640223491", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "a3b252c326b6030ae4872bc08686a1f7a3758f41", "merged_at": "1642117069", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 36580, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "[8_0_X] Support vector<string> data products in friendly class name", "updated_at": "1642117069", "user": "makortel"}

This is based off the DQM framework and inherits from the Common classes written for the new Pixel DQM. Currently it produces like for like plots of the current Pixel Validation plots. The code is invoked only for when the era is phase1. The output directory structure of the validation plots could change in the future as the current tracker validation code has both pixel and strips under a common tracking top directory - for now, the Phase 1 Pixel plots are saved in their own top directory.\n\n(also @fioriNTU @schneiml @lunik1 )\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 29, "closed_at": "1476775477", "comments": 4, "commits": 12, "created_at": "1476186386", "deletions": 40, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "dqm-pending", "new-package-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-rejected", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 16169, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Phase1pixel validation pre12", "updated_at": "1476775477", "user": "davidcarbonis"}

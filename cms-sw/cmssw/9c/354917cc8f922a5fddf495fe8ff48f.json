The process in includes pair production of neutralinos N2N1, N2C1, and C1C1 with small mass splitting mN2-mN1 = 2*(mC1-mN1) = 20 GeV, relevant for several SUSY MET+lepton cross triggers. Efficient population of the phase space relevant for these triggers is ensured with a HT>60 GeV requirement.\r\n\r\nrunTheMatrix tests ran successfully and produced the expected distributions.\r\nThis targets the Run3 Summer21 (12_0_X) MC production for TSG validation, e.g. p6 of\r\nhttps://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ED3idtHv8PqSRqHAf1RSDm64ZlqXaZysxAkBQ9vrheY/edit#slide=id.gec925d3f57_3_1\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1631191951", "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1631130757", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["generators-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "2da036b0283c50402c2d2eb06825690f337e2c6a", "merged_at": "1631191951", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "number": 35203, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Susy gen fragment for trigger validation", "updated_at": "1631191951", "user": "therwig"}

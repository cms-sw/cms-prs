The genParticle selection is taken from the `GenParticlePruner` class and can be configured.\r\n* a plugin for pruning `SimLink` collections based on the `SimTrack` association to a `TrackingParticle`\r\n* a plugin for adding an association between `PackedCandidates` and `GenParticles` based on an existing association between tracks and `GenParticles`\r\n* Needed configuration changes to add this to standard sequences, gated behind the bParking modifier\r\n* bugfix from #34113 \r\n\r\nNo plugin is needed for association between tracks and `GenParticles` through `TrackingParticle` as it is already present in CMSSW (`MCTrackMatcher`).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nOn a B+->Psi2SK sample (one of the possible targets for this PR) we registered this increases in size, timing and memory\r\n\r\n | Size | Timing | Memory\r\n-- | -- | -- | --\r\nRAWSIM | +0.05% | +0.08% | +5MB\r\nRECOSIM | < +0.01% | +0.07% | +2MB\r\nAODSIM | +0.06% |  | \r\nMINIAODSIM | +0.4% | +0.08% | +400kB\r\n\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\nBackport of #33774  and #34113 for an Hackaton for GNN tracking", "branch": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "changed_files": 20, "closed_at": "1628553368", "comments": 12, "commits": 18, "created_at": "1626869956", "deletions": 25, "labels": ["operations-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "pdmv-approved", "orp-approved", "upgrade-approved", "backport-ok"], "merge_commit_sha": "52c5a4ed8c4d1b3fe0bb1c5403cb7ed3aa448a5f", "merged_at": "1628553368", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 34574, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "[Backport] Track-gen matching passing through TrackingParticle (11_2_X)", "updated_at": "1628553369", "user": "elusian"}

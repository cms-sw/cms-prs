The request is summarised in the following JIRA ticket: https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSLITDPG-329\r\n\r\nThe relevant DQM plots are produced by the code in the following 10_2_X PR: https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/23686 (10_1_X backport: https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/23695). The latter code requires the changes in the L1T unpackers made in the following 10_2_X PR: https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/23257 (10_1_X backport: https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/23628). Therefore, both PRs are required for the code to work.\r\n\r\nBackport to 10_1_X: https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/23707", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1531203542", "comments": 12, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1530172599", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "c0849e9a2ca05f8be5c2a51fdcb39a8203619668", "merged_at": "1531203542", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 23706, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Mismatch ratio DQM plots for comparison of Muon and CaloLayer2 input collections between 6 uGT boards", "updated_at": "1531203542", "user": "mzarucki"}

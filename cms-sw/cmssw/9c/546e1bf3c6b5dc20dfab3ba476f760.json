Average reduction is about a factor of 3.  This was the main homework from #20950.\r\n2) additionally, there are bug fixes in 3D reconstruction (used by ClusterRepair).\r\n3) cosmetic fixes in SiPixelTemplate*2D.{hh,cc}.  (Cosmetic fixes in other files coming separately.)\r\n\r\nTests:\r\n- TrackingValidation RunTheMatrix workflow (TTBar 2018_realistic) and it worked fine\r\n- Pixeltree running on data with Tamas's GT worked too. \r\n- runTheMatrix.py -e -n -l 136.831 (on data) with the tag that Tamas gave to us also runs fine.\r\n\r\nAs discussed previously, the plan is to have a separate FastSim PR and then another SiPixelRecHits + SiPixelDigitizer + pixel FastSim PR which involves moving templates + miscellanea to another package.  So I'd like to defer all cosmetics to that PR.

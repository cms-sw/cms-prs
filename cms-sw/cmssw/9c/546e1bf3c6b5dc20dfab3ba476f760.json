Average reduction is about a factor of 3.  This was the main homework from #20950.\r\n2) additionally, there are bug fixes in 3D reconstruction (used by ClusterRepair).\r\n3) cosmetic fixes in SiPixelTemplate*2D.{hh,cc}.  (Cosmetic fixes in other files coming separately.)\r\n\r\nTests:\r\n- TrackingValidation RunTheMatrix workflow (TTBar 2018_realistic) and it worked fine\r\n- Pixeltree running on data with Tamas's GT worked too. \r\n- runTheMatrix.py -e -n -l 136.831 (on data) with the tag that Tamas gave to us also runs fine.\r\n\r\nAs discussed previously, the plan is to have a separate FastSim PR and then another SiPixelRecHits + SiPixelDigitizer + pixel FastSim PR which involves moving templates + miscellanea to another package.  So I'd like to defer all cosmetics to that PR.  (But you can still give me suggestions :)\r\n\r\n@perrotta @slava77 @fabiocos @makortel @tvami @tsusa @OzAmram @cmantill @schuetzepaul ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "comments": 23, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1526778122", "deletions": 470, "labels": ["code-checks-pending", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 23263, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Significant reduction of memory footprint for 2D templates, etc.", "updated_at": "1526849770", "user": "pmaksim1"}

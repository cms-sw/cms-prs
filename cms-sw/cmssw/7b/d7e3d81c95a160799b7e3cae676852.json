Whether lazy-download\nis used is logged in the FrameworkJobReport - but often it takes an expert to decode\nthose!\n\nWe now issue a reasonably-worded warning when this happens.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_3_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1416327691", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1416317784", "deletions": 7, "labels": ["comparison-available", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "2dfdc94d113ab3bca4a6d045b090a9740ed3e87b", "merged_at": "1416327691", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_3_X", "number": 6476, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Issue warnings when lazy-download is not used.", "updated_at": "1416327692", "user": "bbockelm"}

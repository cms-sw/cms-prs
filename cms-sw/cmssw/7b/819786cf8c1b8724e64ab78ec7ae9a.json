The idea is that the updated functions should work on both old and future menus, minimising the need to update these customisations in CMSSW as the HLT menus get updated in `ConfDB`.\r\n\r\nMerely technical. Must not change any of the outputs (not even python configs).\r\n\r\nThanks to @fwyzard for his help with the implementation.\r\n\r\nFYI: @Sam-Harper @silviodonato\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nManual checks, e.g. [this script](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/files/7735529/test.sh.txt).\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nN/A", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1640016147", "comments": 10, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1639745824", "deletions": 136, "labels": ["hlt-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "640829ddce3311baec83ba67a33c884e92244235", "merged_at": "1640016147", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 36536, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "make `customizeHLTforPatatrack` even more robust", "updated_at": "1640016147", "user": "missirol"}

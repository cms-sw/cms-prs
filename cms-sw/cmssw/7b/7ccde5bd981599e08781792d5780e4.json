This can be useful to compare between PRs, or to apply local changes to the tool, or while the tool is broken (like right now).\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nSuccessfully produced a comparison for #28407.\r\n\r\nRunning it is rather tricky, since `cern-get-sso-cookie` does not work inside a cmssw release area currently. Also the bin-to-bin tool is broken at the moment and the fix in #28494 needs to be applied first.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1575363443", "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1574958081", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "30a2ff8ff13aaa416259453b54ad0b62588edc91", "merged_at": "1575363443", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 28501, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "DQM: Script to locally run the bin-to-bin comparison tool", "updated_at": "1575363443", "user": "schneiml"}

However, the customization is out of date and while the code configures, it doesn't run.\nWith the customization, detachedTripletStepChi2Est  is  a Chi2MeasurementEstimatorESProducer (compared to Chi2ChargeMeasurementEstimatorESProducer with the era). The PSet for the former requires no clusterChargeCut is present and PSet validation fails.\n\n@makortel @VinInn @rovere  in case there is some need to support this customization function, it needs an update.\nA better choice is to live with the era-based setup.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 39, "closed_at": "1460134408", "comments": 39, "commits": 17, "created_at": "1459918429", "deletions": 92, "labels": ["alca-pending", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "f1a09fce0f562a3fed6509dabc24248ab7fd9d90", "merged_at": "1460134407", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 13945, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "era-based run1 tracking setup and T0 Data processing update", "updated_at": "1460317262", "user": "slava77"}

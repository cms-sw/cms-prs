Based on this variable, member functions are added to `reco::Muon` to tag showers based on digi information similarly to what is done , for example, [in this study](https://indico.cern.ch/event/804955/#2-follow-up-shower-tagging-met). \r\n\r\nBesides the addition of one more variable to `MuonChamberMatch` (which propagates up to miniAOD), no change to `reco::Muon` objects expected.\r\n \r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe consistency of the `reco::Muon::nDigisInStation` method with the digi counting made a posteriori in ntuples (used for studies like the ones linked above) has been tested on 1K events of a flat pT muon gun and is available [here](https://battilan.web.cern.ch/battilan/HighPt/PullRequest/hit_count/), in such sample. No discrepancy between the two sources of information was found. \r\n\r\nEvent dumps were used to test that `reco::Muon::hasShowerInStation` and `reco::Muon::numberOfShowers` behave as expected.\r\n\r\nThe increase in event size, for slimmedMuons in miniAOD and for the workflow 136.891, was checked to be less than 1%.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 11, "comments": 46, "commits": 9, "created_at": "1554461015", "deletions": 16, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "code-checks-pending", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 26369, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 21, "state": "open", "title": "Adding digi-based shower tagging to reco::Muon", "updated_at": "1555424597", "user": "battibass"}

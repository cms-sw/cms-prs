Important updates: \r\n\r\n- add ML-based TrackQuality as an optional, including adding \"set\" functions for the associated MVA variables in the TTTrack\r\n- add fix to Kalman Filter track fitter to improve efficiency for electron tracks\r\n- enable truncation by default in the pattern recognition (and update truncation to match firmware) \r\n- add \"approximate\" calculations also for the displaced tracking algorithm (i.e. matching what can be done in firmware) \r\n- code developments to improve writing output files needed for HLS, etc. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nExtensive performance studies performed, documented here: \r\n\r\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/985653/contributions/4153943/attachments/2164102/3652037/L1Algo_Dec_16_Jack.pdf\r\n\r\nExpected slight reduced efficiency in busy events (eg ttbar + PU=200) due to enabling truncation, expected increased efficiency for forward electrons due to fixes. \r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nThis is not a backport.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 106, "closed_at": "1613026836", "comments": 52, "commits": 43, "created_at": "1608659100", "deletions": 2563, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "821a26f135794cf1db0b58f1c4a1650fcc75c5fa", "merged_at": "1613026836", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 32574, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 173, "state": "closed", "title": "Update Phase-2 L1 track algorithm code", "updated_at": "1613026836", "user": "skinnari"}

The old HBHEDigiCollection is removed, and the new HB digis are taken from QIE11DigiCollection. Since HB now overlaps with HO in (ieta, iphi, depth) space, HO digis are plotted in depth 7 for now. A future PR will improve on that hack, moving HO (and perhaps all subsystems) to their own ieta-iphi plots, rather than attempting to plot all subsystems together. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nSuccessfully ran over recent local and global runs with partial HB installation. Note that running in online DQM will require appropriate conditions, which are being developed in parallel.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 10, "closed_at": "1559920147", "comments": 27, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1558733506", "deletions": 544, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-notrun", "dqm-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-rejected"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 26941, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "HCALDQM: Updates for Run 3 HB", "updated_at": "1559920147", "user": "DryRun"}

Original description:\r\n\r\n> This PR makes the following updates to the online beamspot applications making them more robust:\r\n> \r\n> rescale pixel track parameter uncertainties to match better the reality\r\n> the uncertainties come from phase0 parametrization, so a difference wrt. phase1 is expected\r\n> @rovere tuned the scale factor such that the pulls of pixel vertex position coordinates were correct\r\n> do pixel tracks only from quadruplets\r\n> triplets produce too many fakes that introduce small biases in the beamspot position\r\n> enlargen the tracking region in Z from +- 3 cm to +- 6 cm\r\n> Tested in CMSSW_9_2_X_2017-06-09-1100.

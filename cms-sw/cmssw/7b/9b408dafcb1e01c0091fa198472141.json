It demotes the `LogError` issued by the class `HLTPrescaleProvider` about \"L1GlobalDecision\" to a `LogDebug` message.\r\n\r\nThis error message, which laments a failure in determining the prescales of the L1T algorithm \"L1GlobalDecision\", can be seen in the logs of several Run-3 workflows (see https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/40481#issuecomment-1381786806) [1]. This 'failure' is expected, because \"L1GlobalDecision\" is not a valid L1T algorithm, but a keyword used mainly by HLT to identify the global decision of the L1T trigger (Final OR, after vetos). For this reason, the `LogError` call is demoted to `LogDebug`.\r\n\r\nMerely technical. No changes expected. Outputs are unchanged (except for the warning message).\r\n\r\n[1] From [step 3 of wf `11634.0` in a recent IB](https://cmssdt.cern.ch/SDT/jenkins-artifacts/ib-baseline-tests/CMSSW_13_0_X_2023-01-31-1100/el8_amd64_gcc11/-GenuineIntel/matrix-results/11634.0_TTbar_14TeV+2021/step3_TTbar_14TeV+2021.log):\r\n```\r\n%MSG-e HLTPrescaleProvider:  PATTriggerProducer:patTrigger  31-Jan-2023 17:18:08 CET Run: 1 Event: 1\r\n Error in determining L1T prescales for HLT path: 'MC_Run3_PFScoutingPixelTracking_v18' with complex L1T seed: 'L1GlobalDecision' using L1TGlobalUtil: \r\n isValid=1 l1tname/error/prescale 1\r\n 0:L1GlobalDecision/0/-1.\r\n%MSG\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nChecked that the error message disappears as expected in one of the relevant wfs (i.e. wf `11634.0`).\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

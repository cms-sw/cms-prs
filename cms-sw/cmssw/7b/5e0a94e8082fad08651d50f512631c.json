Corrections for this effect as a function of muon eta and pT are derived and are made available via the usual prefiring weight producer. \r\n\r\nThe measurement of the effect is is documented in https://indico.cern.ch/event/1027400/contributions/4314164/attachments/2225456/3769418/20210413_L1Prefiring_JSchulte.pdf and the proposal for a correction in https://indico.cern.ch/event/1034615/contributions/4344897/attachments/2237683/3793236/20210503_L1Prefiring_JSchulte.pdf. The proposal, together with a validation of the procedure, will be presented in the PPD General Meeting on 5/20/2021: https://indico.cern.ch/event/1034467/. \r\n\r\nThe prefire weight producer is changed to produce a common prefire weight including both the ECAL and muon system effects. Individual weights for muons, photons, and jets. While for the ECAL prefiring, an eta-pT map is provided as a histogram, for muons TF1s with an analytical parametrization of the pT dependence in multiple bins of muon eta. \r\n\r\nA new ROOT file with these parametrizations is added to the corresponding cms-data repository in this PR: https://github.com/cms-data/PhysicsTools-PatUtils/pull/2", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 8, "closed_at": "1623248709", "comments": 123, "commits": 28, "created_at": "1621279285", "deletions": 252, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved", "urgent", "xpog-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "8185fb18e53d0f889f6fd2e824707c632371a88d", "merged_at": "1623248709", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "number": 33758, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 99, "state": "closed", "title": "Add Muon L1 to prefire weight producer", "updated_at": "1623248709", "user": "JanFSchulte"}

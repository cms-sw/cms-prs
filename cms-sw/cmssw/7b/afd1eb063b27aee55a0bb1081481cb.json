Also the features of #8852 are forward-ported here by adding\n- a possibility to require minimum fraction of tracks shared by reco::Vertex and TrackingVertex (by default off, to keep the current behaviour)\n- monitoring histograms for the shared track fraction with various denominators (extending what was done in #8852)\n\nThe VertexAssociatorByPositionAndTracks is added to a sequence intentionally in TrackValidation_cff.py, because I intend to use it later also in track validation.\n\nIn addition, the following modifications to VertexAssociatorByTracksProducer, that would in principle have belonged to #9223, are included here\n- Migrate to fillDescriptions\n- Replace couts with LogDebug/LogTrace\n- Pass EDProductGetter to AssociationMap constructor\n- Add dictionary for VertexToTrackingVertexAssociator\n\nTested in CMSSW_7_5_X_2015-05-25-2300 and rebased to CMSSW_7_5_X_2015-05-27-1100 (due to dependence on #9223). No changes expected in existing histograms.\n\n@rovere @VinInn \n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 14, "closed_at": "1433498016", "comments": 17, "commits": 9, "created_at": "1432815700", "deletions": 131, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "c43f11249e71db19ac46343ad473da63659d9060", "merged_at": "1433498016", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 9318, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Separate vertex truth matching from vertex validation EDAnalyzer", "updated_at": "1476956349", "user": "makortel"}

It seems that, after including #48037, there are disagreements of the type \"emulator fired but not data\" in BXs different from the central one.\r\n> \r\n> From a quick look at the L1-uGT emulator, I think this might be related to the L1-uGT emulator itself.\r\n> \r\n>   * In [CICADA-uGT emulator additions #44222](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/44222), the CICADA score was implemented as a data member of `GlobalBoard` (see `m_cicadaScore`), setting its value to the CICADA score for BX=0.\r\n> \r\n>   * While this works for BX=0, I think it leads to computing the emulated CICADA decisions for BX!=0 using the CICADA score for BX=0. This may explain why the emulator fires more often than data for BX!=0 in Roberto's tests.\r\n> \r\n> \r\n> This PR implements the use of CICADA scores from the relevant BXs when evaluating the decisions of CICADA seeds in the L1-uGT emulator.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nNone beyond the checks discussed in #48142.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

Minor renaming/refactoring of transient variables in `relval_steps` and `relval_standard` was done in the process.\r\n>\r\n> Changes can be expected in the outputs of the affected workflows, as this changes which HLT results are used by their post-HLT steps (e.g. PAT and DQM).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n`runTheMatrix.py -l 139.001,140.001` passed.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

The following particles are kept in `prunedGenParticles` for very forward phase space (|| > 6.0):\r\n\r\n* Neutrons (pdgId = 2112)\r\n* Photons (pdgId = 22)\r\n* K0L (pdgId = 130)\r\n\r\n* Nuclear fragments / ions (abs(pdgId) >= 1e9)\r\n\r\nThe neutral particles are required for ZDC and FSC truth-level studies in Run 3. The change is gated by the `run3_upc` modifier and therefore does not affect standard pp workflows or non-UPC production.\r\n\r\nNo changes to event content definitions outside the `run3_upc` context are introduced.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\ncompiled with `CMSSW_16_1_X`, need to backport to `CMSSW_15_0_X` and `CMSSW_15_1_X` (for 15_1 the RP was submitted: https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/50142)\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1771087863", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending", "xpog-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_1_X", "number": 50146, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "keep forward neutrals in pruned collection if upc era modifier is used", "updated_at": "1771087888", "user": "michael-pitt"}

The parsing and function evaluation are\ndone using stateless classes so are thread safe and extremely thread\nefficient. The formula parser is shared by all reco::FormulaEvaluators\nto save memory and since the parser is stateless it can efficiently\nbe called by multiple threads simultaneously.\n\nThis is a back port from CMSSW_7_6 of #11516\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 16, "closed_at": "1446660220", "comments": 15, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1443531231", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "6276c5a42722f00df4e35018c65bf08a9b53ca16", "merged_at": "1446660220", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 11555, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Added a formula evaluator to replace TFormula calls", "updated_at": "1449600642", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

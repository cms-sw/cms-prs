The bitset problem was avoided by using the existing typedef name instead of the class name.\nThis PR is identical to #9429, which made the same fixes in CMSSW_7_5_ROOT5_X.  At that time, it was not realized that 7_4_ROOT5_X had the same problem.\nThere will be another PR making the new checksums known in 7_4_X.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_ROOT5_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1434116068", "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1434048331", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "9818fdb9c2016e1a2642483ef920db91b5bb99e0", "merged_at": "1434116068", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "number": 9577, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix checksums and use typedef to fix build errors", "updated_at": "1434746316", "user": "wmtan"}

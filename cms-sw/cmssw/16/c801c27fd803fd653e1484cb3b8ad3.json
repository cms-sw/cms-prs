It's also a safer choice as it does not expose b tagging to changes in the Puppi algorithm and its parameters.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4941296/37722408-3e69aae2-2d2c-11e8-9541-3443b6fb906f.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4941296/37722434-4d406db2-2d2c-11e8-8a02-e23b98041e37.png)\r\n\r\nThe performance of the red curves (standard b tagging with pfCandidates and Phase 2 Puppi cuts) is close now to the black curves, using special custom Phase 2 cuts, which was essentially the attempted solution in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/22608.\r\n\r\nThe PR can be backported to 93X and included in: https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/22554\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 16, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1521645930", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_1_X", "number": 22696, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Switch to pfCandidates for b tagging for Puppi jets", "updated_at": "1521804786", "user": "imarches"}

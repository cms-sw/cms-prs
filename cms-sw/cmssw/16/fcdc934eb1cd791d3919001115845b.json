This limited the area used for the clustering, losing whole layer clusters for no reason. It's fixed now using a boolean for each layer. The consequence is that some multiclusters will have more energy than before (and a couple more layer clusters will be built).\r\n\r\nThis is the back-port of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/20521 to `CMSSW_9_3_X`.", "branch": "CMSSW_9_3_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1505830263", "comments": 15, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1505414424", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["backport-ok", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "971f5b19c68049f6e2592522f128b9113131c387", "merged_at": "1505830263", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_3_X", "number": 20522, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "correctly update boundary box preventing overwriting in case a hit ha", "updated_at": "1505882762", "user": "clelange"}

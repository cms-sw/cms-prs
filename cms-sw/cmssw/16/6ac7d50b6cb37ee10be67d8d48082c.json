Hit and track positions are now correctly transformed from the global to the local coordinate system.\r\n\r\nThe changes include:\r\n* Updated hit position calculations to properly account for rotated diamond detectors in all relevant plots.\r\n* Adjusted the Y-axis range for pixel-related plots from (-8, 8) to (-6, 18) to better match the actual detector coverage.\r\n* Extended geometry information storage to include rotations, translations, and diamond half-widths.\r\n\r\n### PR Validation:\r\n\r\nThe code has been tested with recent data (run 391514, 10k events) and produces accurate plots of diamond hits and tracks. \r\n\r\nLeft plot - after this PR, right plots - before.\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/229639a4-bd92-413d-9bee-35b90d575cb7)\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2d3856db-1bda-44ff-b1c3-d3c1dd10d579)\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7c1f9c1-fb8c-4e7a-8605-21ced2d33471)\r\n\r\n\r\nTests with run 385481 (from 2024) were performed to ensure backward compatibility.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/123dc520-8276-4ae5-b29f-a62074f6c3c1)\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/307e3674-3ee0-4351-96df-a4642d862610)\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditionally, `runTheMatrix` was executed with workflows 1045, 1046, and 1047.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1749015470", "comments": 11, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1748453174", "deletions": 16, "labels": ["dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "d18e04391d99feea1d58525b56349df75c91fea2", "merged_at": "1749015470", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 48201, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "PPS Diamond DQM Local Coordinate System Enhancement", "updated_at": "1749015472", "user": "grzanka"}

This test was try to connect to oracle DB at non-existing server `c`. But since 8th of May, now there is a real server `c` which is causing this test to fail. The change makes sure that we use a more random DB name with possibility to change it via `CMSTEST_FAKE_ORACLE_DBNAME` env (if needed in future).\r\n\r\nOnce this is merged in master IBs then I will open backport PRs for old release cycles too.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1683804216", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["db-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_2_X", "number": 41628, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Oracle test: Use fake/random DB name", "updated_at": "1683806755", "user": "smuzaffar"}

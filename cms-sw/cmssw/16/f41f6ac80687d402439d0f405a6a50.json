See #2449 and #2843. This configuration has also been checked on Fall13 samples (https://indico.cern.ch/event/307553/contribution/3/material/slides/0.pdf) and behaviour is as expected. \n\nThe quality cuts update from #2843 (that improved performance) is not included, but it can be included as well, if you would like to speed-up the RECO sequence.\n\n@slava77, @davidlange6, sorry for not presenting this proposal at RECO meeting, but last week was I think cancelled, and next one is on Thursday. As a result, we are open to discussion of what should be contained in this backport.\n\n@monicava, this is something you want to watch as well\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 19, "closed_at": "1396441282", "comments": 16, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1396355257", "deletions": 375, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_0_X", "number": 3139, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Backport 71x fixes to 70x branch", "updated_at": "1405576021", "user": "jpavel"}

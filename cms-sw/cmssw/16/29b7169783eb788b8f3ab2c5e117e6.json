The script adds a few additional variables for AK4PFCHS and AK8PFPUPPI jets which are not available in the latest nanoAOD production (v5). It saves additional (reco & gen) jet collections that are available in MiniAODs and also jet collections that are not available in MiniAODs by building the jet collections first. These collections are the required input for jet energy calibration and the customized NanoAOD production is first step in the workflow to automate the jet energy calibration. This script needs to be backported to 10_6_X, once merged, for the ultra legacy campaigns.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR: \r\nOriginal PR is #27826", "branch": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1572336355", "comments": 19, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1569240079", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "backport-ok", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved", "xpog-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "6b2ccded346f9b1d6ba38fa90d396585d11f764a", "merged_at": "1572336355", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 28052, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Backport of #27826 (Add customized NanoAOD content for JetMET JERC studies)", "updated_at": "1572336355", "user": "nurfikri89"}

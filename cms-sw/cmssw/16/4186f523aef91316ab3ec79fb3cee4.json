I want to make use of this filter to set cuts on the smin, smaj and time variables. These can be done based on ECal rechit info only and no track requirement. Implementation ignores track-based restriction, when the input tag for the track collection is empty.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe config was privately tested and verified to work properly.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 0, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1649894773", "deletions": 13, "labels": ["hlt-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 37565, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Change tracks to optional requirement in HLTDisplacedEgammaFilter", "updated_at": "1649894794", "user": "arsahasransu"}

This is generally applied in order to discard bad data, but it has been noticed several times in Run 3 (especially during cosmics data-taking) that the DCS information in the FEDRawData (obtained offline via `onlineMetaDataDigis`) is not 100% reliable. \r\nMoreover there has been at least one occurrence (for run [368343](https://cmsoms.cern.ch/cms/runs/lumisection?cms_run=368343&cms_run_sequence=GLOBAL-RUN)) in which a DCS issue which caused the TEC- DCS\r\nbit to be false till LS 990 of run 368343 (~9 am [elog](http://cmsonline.cern.ch/cms-elog/1185134)). As a consequence, the LS in the range [1-990] were discarded by the offline Strip and Tracking DQM (see [this presentation](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1271488/contributions/5445588/attachments/2663515/4614878/debuggingStripClient.pdf)) for more details.\r\nThis impedes the correct certification of that run. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI have run a modified `141.032`  workflow using this customization function (as in https://github.com/mmusich/cmssw/commit/80e792e11ce53320b9840ef499f0070a2e129974) in order to use LS=484 of run 368343, starting from the data in `/ExpressPhysics/Run2023C-Express-v4/FEVT` and obtained filled Strip and Tracking Plots (which are otherwise empty).\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nNot a backport, but will be backported to 13.0.X to request a re-reco of run 368343 (in order to be able to certify it offline)\r\n\r\nCc: @cardinia @sroychow ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 0, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1691751787", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending", "trk"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_3_X", "number": 42546, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "add customization function to remove check on Tracker DCS bits in Strip and Tracker DQM", "updated_at": "1691751811", "user": "mmusich"}

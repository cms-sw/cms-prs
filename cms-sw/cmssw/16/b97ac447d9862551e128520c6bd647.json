(80x https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/16390)\n- Introduce configuration functionality for some parameters of CaloLayer2 emulator, suitable for 2016 HI running: `jetBypassPUS`, `egHOverEcutBarrel`, `egHOverEcutEndcap`, `egBypassEGVetos`.  This is done via CaloParamsHelper class which ensures the backward compatibility of GlobalTags.\n- Introduce a new calo configuration file caloStage2Params_2016_v3_3_HI_cfi, which configures the above parameters as for HI run needs, but also changes the `egShapeIdLUTFile` to a DUMMY LUT effectively bypassing egShapeID cut in the EG Layer2 emulator.\n- Still keep the p-p default calo configuration in hackConditions as caloStage2Params_2016_v3_3_cfi.  This will probably be changed to the v3_3_HI or similar, pending confirmation from the HI community.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 12, "closed_at": "1478101252", "comments": 16, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1477791890", "deletions": 9, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-pending", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "59dec3fd48b6d71f861d95c76c8ebafaf9a7db49", "merged_at": "1478101252", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 16391, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "pr81x-HI-configurable CaloLayer2 emulator ", "updated_at": "1478104750", "user": "rekovic"}

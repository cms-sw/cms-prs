Now all paths containing either 'Ele' or 'Photon' in the name are considered. This includes now also mu-ele cross triggers, where the electron is in the second leg. For those, the electron relevant filters are checked.\nPer-filter efficieny plots are now also on the top page of the egamma validation for a quicker overview for the validator. The plots in the subfolders will be kept in parallel for one or two relval cycles to make sure the transition is smooth, and then dropped if the validators are happy with the new setup.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1396288131", "comments": 5, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1395907494", "deletions": 65, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "2f2e57836e8ef0b50a4f2bfb040969e603a16d26", "merged_at": "1396288131", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_1_0_pre6", "number": 3045, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Emdqm update", "updated_at": "1396338803", "user": "thomreis"}

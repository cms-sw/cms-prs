As those classes have now gotten out of sync, and that the libs get randomly chosen or not depending on how the linker feels at any given time, this PR is to remove any use of the classes for now.  Any duplicated code should be removed or renamed (hopefully removed) in order to restore the use of this package.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1432922932", "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1432919298", "deletions": 8, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "dqm-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "5aee1ed592c334edad355d77fc157c7fc5d14c89", "merged_at": "1432922932", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 9344, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Remove HWW DQM modules ", "updated_at": "1432922932", "user": "davidlange6"}

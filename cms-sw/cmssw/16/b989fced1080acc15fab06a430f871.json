Some name changes have also been propagated to additional modules.\r\n\r\nThe code in this PR passed the git CI tests of the L1 track group, seen in the CI [results](https://gitlab.cern.ch/cms-l1tk/cmssw_CI/-/pipelines/10462877 ). The git CI tests run the baseline L1 tracking algorithm (both for prompt and displaced tracking) on ttbar events with zero pileup (to save CPU). The CI checks require that compared with reference, the tracking efficiency does not fall significantly, the number of reconstructed tracks does not increase significantly, and that the z0 resolution does not get significantly worse. (The exact cuts can be found [here](https://gitlab.cern.ch/cms-l1tk/cmssw_CI/-/blob/masterCI/.gitlab-ci.yml?ref_type=heads#L243)).", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 216, "comments": 44, "commits": 8, "created_at": "1736431199", "deletions": 11104, "labels": ["simulation-pending", "l1-pending", "operations-pending", "core-approved", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-approved", "trk", "changes-dataformats"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 47067, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 166, "state": "open", "title": "L1 tracking update", "updated_at": "1740834609", "user": "tschuh"}

Some name changes have also been propagated to additional modules.\r\n\r\nsome specific added features:\r\n- KF simulator callable in KF emulator chain\r\n- KF starts state updating process from 2-layer states instead of 0-layer states\r\n- 5 parameter fit simulation added to KF emulator as an option\r\n- DR uses 11 layer scheme\r\n- DR receives now full 10b stub identifier for all stubs\r\n- KFout module splitted into track qulaity and final output formatter\r\n- DRin renamed in TrackMultiplexer, merges now all seed type channel into one\r\n- L1FPGATrackProducer produces now emulator output in one step rendering module TBout obsolete\r\n\r\nThis PR is based of CMSSW_14_2_0_pre4 rebased to master on Jan 9.\r\n\r\nThe code in this PR passed the git CI tests of the L1 track group, seen in the CI [results](https://gitlab.cern.ch/cms-l1tk/cmssw_CI/-/pipelines/10462877 ). The git CI tests run the baseline L1 tracking algorithm (both for prompt and displaced tracking) on ttbar events with zero pileup (to save CPU). The CI checks require that compared with reference, the tracking efficiency does not fall significantly, the number of reconstructed tracks does not increase significantly, and that the z0 resolution does not get significantly worse. (The exact cuts can be found [here](https://gitlab.cern.ch/cms-l1tk/cmssw_CI/-/blob/masterCI/.gitlab-ci.yml?ref_type=heads#L243)).", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 220, "comments": 101, "commits": 15, "created_at": "1736431199", "deletions": 13077, "labels": ["simulation-pending", "l1-pending", "core-approved", "operations-approved", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-approved", "trk", "changes-dataformats"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 47067, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 273, "state": "open", "title": "L1 tracking update", "updated_at": "1747151683", "user": "tschuh"}

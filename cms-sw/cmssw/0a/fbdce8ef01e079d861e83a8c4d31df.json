In particular, `TriggerResultsFilter` modules with valid patterns now use `throw=True`, while those with invalid patterns are those with `throw=False`.\r\n\r\nThanks to @fwyzard for much help with the implementation; I tag him to review these changes.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nPrivate tests with the relevant unit-tests.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nA backport to `12_4_X` is not necessary, but might be useful.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1660309730", "deletions": 204, "labels": ["hlt-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 39044, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 8, "state": "open", "title": "allow `TriggerResultsFilter` to throw for invalid `HLTPathStatus` patterns", "updated_at": "1660560312", "user": "missirol"}

Minor renaming/refactoring of transient variables in `relval_steps` and `relval_standard` was done in the process.\r\n\r\nChanges can be expected in the outputs of the affected workflows, as this changes which HLT results are used by their post-HLT steps (e.g. PAT and DQM).\r\n\r\nThis PR will likely need to be rebased after #39755 is integrated.\r\n\r\nTo add `--hltProcess reHLT` to the post-HLT step of the Run-3 data RelVals, the following is done:\r\n - rename `HLTDR3_2021` to `HLTDR3_2022`;\r\n - replace `HLTRUN3` with `HLTDR3_2022` (they are identical, making the first redundant);\r\n - create `RECODR3_reHLT` (= `\"RECODR3 + --hltProcess=reHLT\"`);\r\n - replace `RECODR3_2021` with `RECODR3_reHLT`;\r\n - rename `RECONANORUN3` to `RECONANORUN3_reHLT`;\r\n - rename `RECOCOSMRUN3` to `RECOCOSMRUN3_reHLT`.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n`runTheMatrix.py -l 139.001,140.001,140.104` passed.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

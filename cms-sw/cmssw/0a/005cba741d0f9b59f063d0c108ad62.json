The tools to get cell u,v from the position or the position from u,v are now part of the main link to SIM/RECO geometry - HGCalDDDConst. These codes take care of all types of cells (full and partial wafers) in the correct way. In earlier implementations of V16/V15/... the extended cells were not fully treated and parts of the cells could not be identified (x,y to u,v were not proper). The current implementation will take care of this - so the results of those versions will be marginally affected.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested using a script inside Geometry/HGCalCommonData/test/python\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nNothing special", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 16, "closed_at": "1654144785", "comments": 26, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1653876008", "deletions": 188, "labels": ["geometry-approved", "simulation-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "upgrade-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "1e651ea8c9ebd7f675a3cae3bd4f39561970c919", "merged_at": "1654144785", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 38118, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 7, "state": "closed", "title": "Phase2-hgx314 A step toward the V17 version of HGCal Geometry", "updated_at": "1654144785", "user": "bsunanda"}

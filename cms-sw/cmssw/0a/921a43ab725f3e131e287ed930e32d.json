Now, PPS simulation is triggered by the flag LHCTransport (False by default), which needs to be set to TRUE.  Since the PPS geometry is not yet loaded into the DB, the digi was removed from the chain in order to avoid failure in the standard tests. In summary, this PR changes SimPPS/PPSSimTrackProducer and PPSProtonTransport to save inthe LHCTransport data container only the propagate protons (only secondary vertices in from of PPS region). \r\n\r\nAnother PR will be issued when PPS geometry gets loaded into the DB, pluging in the digi part.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nscram b runtests ran with no issue\r\nscram b code-checks  and scram b code-formats also ran ok \r\n\r\nrunTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos was ran again with the results:\r\n35 33 27 20 15 4 1 1 1 tests passed, 0 1 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 failed\r\n\r\nAll the 6 wf failed due to timeout.

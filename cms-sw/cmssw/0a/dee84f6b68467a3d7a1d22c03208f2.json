Add internal counter to the `MixItr` counting the number of iterated elements, and use that for `operator!=()`. The `MixCollection<T>::end()` is implemented by calculating the number of all signal and pileup objects from all the contained `CrossingFrame<T>`s.\r\n\r\nTested in CMSSW_10_1_X_2018-02-18-2300. Expecting changes at some level (probably not much, given that this \"randomness\" has been there since 2005).", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 4, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1519119051", "deletions": 10, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_1_X", "number": 22270, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Fix undefined behaviour in MixCollection<T>::MixItr", "updated_at": "1519119258", "user": "makortel"}

This is clearly not invertible.\n\nMaybe in the long run there should be a change in logic of the algorithm.\n\n@VinInn  @rovere let me know if the change is OK\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1467372448", "comments": 11, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1467121975", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "26005b617bb7e5060b88b1725fd7789c01d9fb37", "merged_at": "1467372448", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 15016, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "suppress LogError for somewhat clearly bad input of TrajectoryStateCombiner", "updated_at": "1467372448", "user": "slava77"}

This will help when we have changes in simulation (e.g. changes in Phase2 geometries) than needs to be validated allowing us to reduce the statistical fluctuations recycling the underlying GEN.\r\n2. to run GEN only wfs (for MinBias, or default samples) without having to act manually on each workflow.\r\n\r\n#### PR Validation\r\n\r\nRunning, e.g., `15824.0` and `15634.0`.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 30, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1716279526", "deletions": 10, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "tests-started", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 45005, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Introducing `SimOnGen` and `GenOnly` wfs for 2024 and 2026D110", "updated_at": "1717659132", "user": "AdrianoDee"}

In the lack of GT containing a JetResolutionRcd entry, all tests (runTheMatrix or standard tests) involving a PAT process will fail if it touches the MET tool.\n\nPackages involved : \n- DataFormats/METReco\n- DataFormats/PatCandidates\n- JetMETCorrections/Modules\n- JetMETCorrections/Type1MET\n- PhysicsTools/PatAlgos\n- PhysicsTools/PatUtils\n- RecoMET/METAlgorithms\n- RecoMET/METProducers\n\nChanges expected : \n- very tiny change in CPU consumption due the MET significance computation\n- MET significance is now computed in the central pat::MET\n- tiny change expected in the slimmedMET/ patPFMetType1 pT values due to the uniformization of cleaning (removal of overlaps selected/slimmed muons and electrons)\n- unclustered uncertainties changed\n- smeared MET not set to the central value anymore\n- JER uncertainties accessible if someone uses the smeared MET\n  Automatically ported from CMSSW_8_0_X #13115 (original by @cms-met).\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 40, "closed_at": "1457600186", "comments": 27, "commits": 38, "created_at": "1455786383", "deletions": 1268, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "6b124ffa182bfc25a61c1bf700a7522eac272cd2", "merged_at": "1457600186", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 13372, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "MET PAT tool update + update of MET significance", "updated_at": "1457600186", "user": "cmsbuild"}

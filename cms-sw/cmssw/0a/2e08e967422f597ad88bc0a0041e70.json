In doing so, I discovered four packages in which some ROOT 5 checksums were already either missing or incorrect in ROOT6 XML files.  This PR aligns the incorrect ROOT6 checksums and version numbers with those in ROOT5.\nPlease merge this PR as soon as convenient.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_ROOT6_X", "changed_files": 0, "closed_at": "1425845533", "comments": 6, "commits": 0, "created_at": "1425598493", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-pending", "generators-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-rejected"], "number": 8108, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Align ROOT6 checksums and versions with ROOT5", "updated_at": "1425846155", "user": "wmtan"}

The MC-truth analysis is already contained in Validation/MuonHits and Validation/MuonCSCDigis, and included in the standard release validation sequence. The data vs emulator comparisons are now in DQM/L1TEmulator(Client) and DQM/Integration. The remaining useful pieces will be cannibalized into `CSCTriggerPrimitiveAnalyzer`. \r\n \r\nI added documentation in README.md files so people know how they can use the test configurations.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested in CMSSW_12_0_X on a recent run. \r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nBefore submitting your pull requests, make sure you followed this checklist:\r\n- verify that the PR is really intended for the chosen branch\r\n- verify that changes follow [CMS Naming, Coding, And Style Rules](http://cms-sw.github.io/cms_coding_rules.html)\r\n- verify that the PR passes the basic test procedure suggested in the [CMSSW PR instructions](https://cms-sw.github.io/PRWorkflow.html)\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 15, "closed_at": "1620208753", "comments": 21, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1619750027", "deletions": 35, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "2289bc907a670251c94a0a5a597c06ade8f43b00", "merged_at": "1620208753", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "number": 33582, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 8, "state": "closed", "title": "Cleanup of data/simulation analyzer modules in CSCTriggerPrimitives", "updated_at": "1620208753", "user": "dildick"}

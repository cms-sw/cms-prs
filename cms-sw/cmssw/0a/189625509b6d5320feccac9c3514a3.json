RelVals are added in PyReleaseValidation, and the BTLDetId format is updated to accomodate navigation also according to this scenario. This version keeps the staggering along phi in blocks of 16. Scenario D34 is added to have a flat geometry with bars along z, and passive material identical to scenario D24. Scenario D34 is clean from overlaps, some are present in scenario D33.\r\n\r\nThe numbering scheme has been verified with the available test code, and appears correct.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 19, "comments": 41, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1539355763", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "geometry-pending", "hold", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending", "upgrade-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_4_X", "number": 24854, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "MTD, add new geometry scenario (D33 and D34) for bars along z coordinate ", "updated_at": "1541368544", "user": "fabiocos"}

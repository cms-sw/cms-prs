RelVals are added in PyReleaseValidation, and the BTLDetId format is updated to accomodate navigation also according to this scenario. This version has a flat geometry, and the passive material layout is updated compared to D24, with the Al support plate in between the crystals and the tracker, and the PCB boards behind. A gap of 4.5 mm is provided between the crystals in z (to accomodate SiPM), crystals are 56 mm long, for a total of 42 modules. The crystal thickness changes in blocks of 14 modules.\r\nScenario D34 is the same as D33 but without gap between crystals in z, for efficiency studies.\r\n\r\nThe numbering scheme has been verified with the available test code, and appears correct. The radial crystal position is unmodified wrt the old passive material layout. No overlap is detected, and test workflows for SingleMuon that are added pass correctly.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 20, "closed_at": "1541865494", "comments": 75, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1539355763", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "operations-approved", "orp-approved", "pdmv-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "331d645aa5be78be19c8d623efc5edc92836135e", "merged_at": "1541865494", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_4_X", "number": 24854, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "MTD, add new geometry scenario (D33 and D34) for bars along z coordinate ", "updated_at": "1541865494", "user": "fabiocos"}

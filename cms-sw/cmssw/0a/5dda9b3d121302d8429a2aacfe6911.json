If this PR will be backported, please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nWill be included in #42969, i.e. the backport of #42967.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1696960058", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["hlt-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_3_X", "number": 42976, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "disable unit test of `hltPrintMenuVersions` in non-`x86-64` builds", "updated_at": "1696960573", "user": "missirol"}

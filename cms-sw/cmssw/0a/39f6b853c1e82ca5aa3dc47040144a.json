Aside from providing additional functionality, the changes were structured in a way that avoid any code duplication and provides full backward compatibility. Users can choose between the two flows by using _diamondSampicLocalReconstruction_ or _totemTimingLocalReconstruction_ in a process path.\r\n\r\nTo test those changes, an additional producer named _DiamondSampicDigiProducer_ was created. This producer takes testbeam data and converts them to _totemTimingDigi_ (by utilising fake channel mapping), which could be then passed to the reco stage. PR contains an appropriate test file(_RecoPPS/Local/test/totemTimingDigiConverter_reco_cfg_) which produces reco by using this module as a starting point. \r\n\r\n**-----------------------------Implementation----------------------------**\r\nChanges to the existing file mainly concern source generalisation-to support both UFSD and **DIAMOND** Sampic flows. This is done either through class templates and then class specialization or extracting geometry information and applying conditional statements. Aside from those changes, some previously hardcoded parameters were extracted to python config and the obsolete code was removed.\r\n\r\nFor a more detailed overview, please refer to the provided pdf https://cernbox.cern.ch/index.php/s/2RQ0hD5B0QjLYYA", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 10, "closed_at": "1628897801", "comments": 34, "commits": 20, "created_at": "1628061108", "deletions": 59, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "e45b01a9e02a3b6220b0ee7b87e611f6c13c3ab5", "merged_at": "1628897801", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "number": 34759, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 15, "state": "closed", "title": "Diamond Sampic reco", "updated_at": "1628897802", "user": "ChrisMisan"}

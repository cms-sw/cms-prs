The original PR is [here](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/45664).\r\n\r\nThe EMTF emulator DQM will now include the displaced muon pT and dxy information which was added to the EMTF in 2024. The code to make these plots already existed, but an era modifier to set 'hasDisplacementInfo' to true for 2024 Run3 data was necessary to make it appear.\r\n\r\nThere are two new DQM histograms showing unconstrained muon pT from the hardware and from the emulator.\r\nThe errorSummaryDen, errorSummaryNum, and mismatchRatio histograms have two new bins for unconstrained muon pt, and transverse displacement.\r\n\r\nAfter inclusion of displaced muons, a much higher muon mismatch ratio should be expected because unconstrained muon pT assignment in the emulator slightly differs from the hardware due to fixed point vs floating point models. A normal unconstrained pT mismatch rate is high in the EMTF (~30%).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe DQM was successfully run locally on lxplus\r\ndataset='/Muon0/Run2024F-ZMu-PromptReco-v1/RAW-RECO'\r\nrun='383449'\r\nrunTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos: all passed except 1000.0_RunMinBias2011A which has a https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/44369 when CMSSW is run from eos.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

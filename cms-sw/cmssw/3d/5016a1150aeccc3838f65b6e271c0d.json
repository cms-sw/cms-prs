Hardcoding the tag instead is less brittle and should work just as well in this test.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/28010#pullrequestreview-509242393\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nProblem unit test passes with this change. This change does not affect anything other than the unit test.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1602858149", "comments": 15, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1602767442", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "db-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "7a24161307e3d6cef51a61cea04f23cafc4f7229", "merged_at": "1602858149", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 31806, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Don't hardcode the global tag in the unit test", "updated_at": "1602858913", "user": "wddgit"}

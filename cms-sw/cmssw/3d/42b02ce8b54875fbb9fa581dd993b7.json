In addition, it removes (now-)unnecessary code from `classes.h`, adds `persistent=\"false\"` to all `edm::Wrapper<T>` instantiations and removes it from other classes, and finally moves `GlobalErrorBase` (and `Point3DBase`) related dictionaries to `DataFormats/GeometryCommonDetAlgo` that seemed like the right place (it seems to me these dictionaries were defined in `TrackingTools/PatternTools` because of `typedef std::pair<GlobalPoint, GlobalError> VertexConstraint` type alias used there; I also hope the \"ROOT6 problem\" mentioned in the comment has been solved already).\r\n\r\nResolves https://github.com/cms-sw/framework-team/issues/980\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles. The pattern-to-name change kept all existing definitions in the `.rootmap` file, and added a few more with that use the type aliases I used in the `name` attribute.

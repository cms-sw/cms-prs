Hopefully in a way that does not require 100+ files to be recompiled aside from when a new era is defined. This can be further improved by removing the central Eras.py file - this means changing all of the users os Eras.py to import the Modifier(s) that they will use instead of the central Eras.py. I think we can start enforcing this and at the same time go back and modify the packages using this Eras.py - but not for today. (once done, the cmsDriver change needed is ~trivial)\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 33, "closed_at": "1471330765", "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1471255077", "deletions": 77, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "new-package-pending", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-rejected"], "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 15469, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "split out era definitions into separate python files,", "updated_at": "1471330765", "user": "davidlange6"}

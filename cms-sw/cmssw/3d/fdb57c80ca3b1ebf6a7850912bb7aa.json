We essentially tell the compiler to open the definition from a module rather than parsing.\r\n\r\nPart of #15248\r\n\r\ncc: @davidlange6, @smuzaffar, @oshadura", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1581669676", "comments": 20, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1581436320", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "7211dca8149aea674af191f93ffd45aa86def7f3", "merged_at": "1581669675", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 28925, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "[cxxmodules] Workaround missing CLHEP modulemap.", "updated_at": "1581669676", "user": "vgvassilev"}

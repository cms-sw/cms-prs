Changes were made to\r\nAlignment/APEEstimation/macros/DrawIteration.C and\r\nAlignment/APEEstimation/macros/commandsDrawIteration.C\r\nto use phase 1 geometry.\r\n - This only affects the plotting tools\r\n\r\nOther changes include a small automation of the APE determination workflow in the following files:\r\nAlignment/APEEstimation/cfgTemplatesData/run15Iterations.bash\r\nAlignment/APEEstimation/cfgTemplatesData/run10Iterations.bash\r\nAlignment/APEEstimation/cfgTemplates/batchSubmitTemplate.tcsh\r\n - Before, one had to manually specify a sleeping time between iterations, waiting for batch jobs to finish\r\n - Now, as soon as all batch jobs of an iteration have finished, the sleeping is ended\r\nThe old workflow is kept in the following files for now:\r\n\r\nAlignment/APEEstimation/cfgTemplatesData/manual_run15Iterations.bash\r\nAlignment/APEEstimation/cfgTemplatesData/manual_run10Iterations.bash\r\n\r\nFinally, the deprecated use of CondCore.DBCommon.CondDBCommon_cfi was removed from\r\nAlignment/APEEstimation/test/SkimProducer/skimProducer_cfg.py.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 8, "closed_at": "1510578615", "comments": 39, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1507664791", "deletions": 157, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "3e40de1142a54503f02411b1ab34be73ea526c7e", "merged_at": "1510578615", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_0_X", "number": 20889, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 21, "state": "closed", "title": "Better automation of workflow and full inclusion of phase 1 geometry", "updated_at": "1510668455", "user": "mteroerd"}

If the user requests a luminosity value that is accumulated in the middle of the year, the darkening must be evaluated using a partial luminosity value for the last year. This computation was done incorrectly, which manifested as larger-than-expected response correction factors (seen in https://indico.cern.ch/event/844333/contributions/3546577/attachments/1900343/3136629/Phase_2_conditions_update.pdf). The calculation has now been fixed and confirmed to be correct.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRan the test analyzer [hbhedarkeninganalyzer_cfg.py](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/CalibCalorimetry/HcalPlugins/test/hbhedarkeninganalyzer_cfg.py) to check the output at various intermediate luminosity values.\r\n\r\nattn: @abdoulline", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1568053457", "comments": 18, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1567532919", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "db-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "8e194076a15ed728e6de422e88723d24e94fac45", "merged_at": "1568053457", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27922, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "fix handling of intermediate lumi values in HCAL aging", "updated_at": "1568053457", "user": "kpedro88"}

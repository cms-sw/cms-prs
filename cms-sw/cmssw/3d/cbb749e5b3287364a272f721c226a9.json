The effect decreases going from hits to segments to standalone muons to global/tracker muons.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_2_X", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1409054463", "comments": 10, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1408825734", "deletions": 101, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "dbec580f7ef42d6f953b68be7eada7a944a5ba2d", "merged_at": "1409054463", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_2_X", "number": 5034, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "introduce repacking step in post-LS1 CSC simulation", "updated_at": "1409054463", "user": "slava77"}

The\nAK4 and AK8 global tags are now present at RECO and HLT level. I have\nmoved the defaults from AK5/AK7 to AK4/AK8 now. I also added services\nfor ALL available payloads (AK1,2,3,...10). The \"default\" is AK4. \n\nI have coordinated with JME Trigger contacts to include the requisite\nchanges to CondDB for the HLT-related software changes. However, this\nwill still break the Run 1 matrix tests (5.1 and 25.0) with this\ncurrent PR. \n\nAdditional changes were made to fix unit tests by changing the global\ntag from \"startup\" to \"run2_mc\", which fixed the broken unit tests. \n\nTested on the following workflows :\n- Working : 4.22, 4.53, 8.0, 1000.0, 1001.0, 1341.0, 25202.0\n- Broken : 5.1, 25.0\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_2_X", "changed_files": 448, "closed_at": "1411742426", "comments": 34, "commits": 289, "created_at": "1410968158", "deletions": 66622, "labels": ["alca-pending", "analysis-pending", "comparison-pending", "core-pending", "daq-approved", "db-pending", "dqm-pending", "fastsim-pending", "geometry-pending", "hlt-pending", "l1-pending", "new-package-pending", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending", "visualization-pending"], "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_2_X", "number": 5350, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "AK5 to AK4 for JEC's, Redux", "updated_at": "1415045425", "user": "rappoccio"}

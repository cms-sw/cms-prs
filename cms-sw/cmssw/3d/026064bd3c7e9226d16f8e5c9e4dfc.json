Therefore we expect no change in outcomes of the standard reconstruction with this PR.\r\nThe latest change to this module is done with the PR #30687, which was also a technical change.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nThis PR compiles without error and passes code-checks & a runTheMatrix workflow (13250 WF for a quick check)\r\n\r\n@andresib @mileva \r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1621311136", "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1621254458", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["bug-fix", "code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "c861ecffe8b371654f4f0e917036d83a0801f07e", "merged_at": "1621311136", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "number": 33753, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "bugfix RPCSeedGenerator wrong nullptr check", "updated_at": "1621311136", "user": "jhgoh"}

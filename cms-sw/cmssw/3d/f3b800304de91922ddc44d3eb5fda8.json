This is mostly python except that due to a format change in the scale & smearing file, we need a small (backwards compatible) code change. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, we realised there are variables in the electron/photon which were introduced in 9X which are not filled in the 8X electrons/photons, we added a modifier to do make those variables and run in the 80X miniAOD sequence.  It would be nice to have this. \r\n\r\nNote, this is not final, there was a last minute problem with the legacy scale & smearing corrections which mean they are currently unavailible. As such for testing purposes we have the file set incorrectly to the 2017 values right now.  But we wanted to get the process moving here. \r\n\r\nDo we make the 94X PR to the MINIAOD branch or the normal branch?\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": "1526061581", "comments": 70, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1523880492", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "requires-external", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "0af056bc51660fd786388aff179a48044f7365e8", "merged_at": "1526061581", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 22975, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 16, "state": "closed", "title": "Adapting E/gamma miniAOD for the 80X re-miniAOD V2: 10_2_X", "updated_at": "1526061581", "user": "Sam-Harper"}

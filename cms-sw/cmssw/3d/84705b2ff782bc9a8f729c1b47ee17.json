It looks for the maximum cross-correlation between the acquired pulse and a template with different time shifts.\r\nThis method uses the same pulse template ad the energy reconstruction, hence it doesn't need any parameter.\r\nAlso, Out-Of-Time (OOT) Pileup is mitigated by removing the OOT amplitudes using the result of the multi-fit algorithm.\r\n\r\nThe performance was discussed in various DPG meetings. \r\nSome references with more details are available:\r\nECAL general meeting:\r\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/1002949/contributions/4211423/attachments/2182555/3687212/ECALtiming_2021_2_2.pdf\r\n\r\nPerformance on Monte Carlo:\r\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/966023/contributions/4135611/attachments/2163562/3652215/ecaldpg_121620.pdf\r\n\r\nDescription of the algorithm (called KUCC here) and performance on data:\r\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/953451/contributions/4026342/attachments/2108199/3545710/ecaldpg_gentime.pdf\r\n\r\nNotes for this PR:\r\nthis PR is including the code into the main repository, but the default Timing reco method will remain unchanged. It is, of course, possible to enable this method changing the \"timingMethod\" variable.\r\n\r\nExample of test file:\r\nRecoLocalCalo/EcalRecProducers/test/testEcalUncalibRechitProducerWithCC_cfg.py\r\n\r\n@thomreis @jking79 @crogan\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1615939711", "comments": 41, "commits": 47, "created_at": "1615299392", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "4bcdf9671bf409f7895ba1ffaa6286616e7ca349", "merged_at": "1615939711", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 33119, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 33, "state": "closed", "title": "Cross-correlation algorithm for the ECAL timing reconstruction", "updated_at": "1615939711", "user": "nminafra"}

We didn't anticipate that in our code (we thought bookHistograms would be called once at the begin of each job). This lead to a feature which blew up the number of times we fill MET histograms per even when running over a large number of runs. We introduce now a protection which should fix that feature. It seems though when running centrally this feature was not present.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_2_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1405319960", "comments": 6, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1405063963", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "7ef49b3b6a65681026b364375d11a012799a2b51", "merged_at": "1405319960", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_2_X", "number": 4615, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "fix feature that at start of each new run MET histograms are filled twic...", "updated_at": "1405326342", "user": "webermat"}

In this PR I propose to:\r\n\r\n1. Have a `const` reference to the employed GBRForests as a member so one does not have to pass them as a function argument with the rather obscure name `hoc` (for \"HeavyObjectCache\"). Having `const` members is ok after all, I only have it with the mutable members.\r\n2. Have a new output type for the PFAlgo, so one only has to use the algo by the `operator()` instead of retrieving all the results that are saved as mutable members of the algo via getter functions\r\n3. Merge PFEGammaProducer.h with .cc\r\n\r\nPFEGammaAlgo has now only half as many mutable members as before, so we are on a good track towards a nice thread safe algo there I think!\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCMSSW compiles and local matrix tests pass.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\n\r\nNo backport intended.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1560276656", "comments": 20, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1559327667", "deletions": 272, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "dce6495088346ff0593f12c5d713f72556f87841", "merged_at": "1560276656", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27045, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "Slight refactoring of PFEGammaAlgo", "updated_at": "1560276656", "user": "guitargeek"}

This is expected to be useful for subdetectors depending on the LHC settings, e.g. (CT)PPS.\r\n\r\nThe new filter is not used in any central workflow, thus no changes are expected.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe filter has been tested with the included config ``CondTools/RunInfo/test/xangleBetaStarFilter_test_cfg.py`` which runs on a 2018D miniAOD file and filters events taken with 150 <= xangle < 170. The xangle and beta* histograms, before (blue) and after (red dashed) the filter show the expected behaviour:\r\n\r\n![make_cmp](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17830858/90410626-e5a3c980-e0aa-11ea-9491-cfef6edba6f8.png)\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1598338724", "comments": 15, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1597669196", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "db-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "28e39fb8bdd9b09109e9dccb049f24f3de650932", "merged_at": "1598338724", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 31159, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Adding xangle and beta* filter", "updated_at": "1598338724", "user": "jan-kaspar"}

This will be reflected in the QIE calibrations, but had been left out of the simulated values until now.\n\nThis PR updates the hardcode conditions. A separate update to the database conditions will be made by @abdoulline et al.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1475569710", "comments": 13, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1475529457", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["alca-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "b453b3a77295fe1e9a8ec29e5822bc5ea1e1963d", "merged_at": "1475569710", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 16082, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "use shunt factor in QIE11 hardcode calibrations", "updated_at": "1475661517", "user": "kpedro88"}

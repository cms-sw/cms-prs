L1 track jobs updated to use D88 geometry by default and to use python3.\r\n2. Small changes to duplicate track removal code to make it easier to understand.\r\n3. Duplicate track removal now operates in parallel on several slightly overlapping track Pt bins, so emulate more accurately the firmware.\r\n4. Fixes for code that write .txt files used for debugging firmware for \"combined\" tracklet modules. Also adding of extra LUT tables needed by the \"combined\" modules.\r\n5. Bug fix for MatchProcessor module, so if multiple stubs are matched to a seed in a given layer, the best stub is selected.\r\n6. Significant changes to the use of stub bend in the tracklet pattern reco, so as: (a) To allow the code to cope with changes to the bend cuts used in the FE electronics (b) To allow the bend cuts within the tracklet algorithm to be specified in more bins in the tracker volume. Details of these changes are in https://github.com/cms-L1TK/cmssw/pull/178 .\r\n\r\n_Tracking performance little changed._", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 62, "comments": 41, "commits": 25, "created_at": "1671127317", "deletions": 743, "labels": ["l1-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-approved", "trk"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_1_X", "number": 40335, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 23, "state": "open", "title": "Updates to L1 tracking (improved use of stub bend etc.)", "updated_at": "1680789233", "user": "tomalin"}

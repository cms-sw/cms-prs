It is to activate the work done in #3482.  See @bachtis' talk in the 24/Apr/2014 TP studies meeting.  That pull request also brings in a configuration error in step3 by referring to a file that is missing from the pull request.  To fix that I changed the default back to the original file.\n\nThis pull request might need some changes depending on the response from @bachtis.  Since this also fixes some tests I'll merge this and add any changes required in a subsequent pull request.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1398417169", "comments": 2, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1398416411", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "79224cd700c28b45b04505b4171b566cef93e1d6", "merged_at": "1398417169", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "number": 3498, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Customise forward ParticleFlow linking", "updated_at": "1438587236", "user": "mark-grimes"}

The algorithm has been tweaked slightly.\n2. RPC timing was added directly to the reco::Muon dataformat. The time calculation was added and timing code was re-organized in places.\n\nThe improvements in DT timing after the change have been shown here: https://indico.cern.ch/event/483080/contribution/1/attachments/1212148/1768319/ptraczyk_201601_muon_timing.pdf\n\nNothing besides the performance of DT timing (and CSC timing to a very small extent) should change.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 19, "closed_at": "1454054953", "comments": 27, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1453294845", "deletions": 166, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-rejected"], "merge_commit_sha": "eabdc107f3980e0c9e5d55df7e588f0d4334d194", "merged_at": "1454054953", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 13010, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "Add RPC timing in reco::Muon dataformat.

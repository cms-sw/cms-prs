New monitoring elements are added to layer-1 DQM for the 3x6x32 bits. The modification is done in such a way that it works before and after the card addition.\r\n\r\nNote that the monitoring elements for HCAL FB4-5 are commented out, we will put them back once HCAL fixes them (FB4-5 are reserved bits and not used for LLP, but they are sending unphysical data there which layer-1 could not read out, causing discrepancies seen when comparing them).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nValidated by running offline DQM on past commissioning runs, it works as expected for current production firmware. Tested with online DQM at P5 with new firmware.\r\n\r\nThis is a backport of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/42048", "branch": "CMSSW_13_1_X", "changed_files": 5, "comments": 12, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1687591081", "deletions": 64, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "l1-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "backport-ok"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_1_X", "number": 42076, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "add layer-1 monitoring for new slot-7 cards [13_1_0]", "updated_at": "1688352180", "user": "hftsoi"}

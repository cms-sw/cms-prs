The CPU workflows gave results identical to the baseline integration build. The GPU workflows displayed slight variations, but the variations are also present between multiple runs of the same version (baseline or this branch).\r\n\r\nUnit tests were fine except one problem not related the this branch and followed up in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/33797", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 14, "closed_at": "1624960913", "comments": 9, "commits": 10, "created_at": "1622113074", "deletions": 112, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "heterogeneous-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "number": 33865, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 30, "state": "closed", "title": "Code cleanliness improvements in follow-up to #31722", "updated_at": "1624960914", "user": "ericcano"}

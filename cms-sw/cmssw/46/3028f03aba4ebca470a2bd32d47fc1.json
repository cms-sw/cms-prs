This modifier reproduces many of the changes from `run2_HEPlan1_2017`. It is *not* included in the `Run2_2018` Era by default, but can be chained with it in a cmsDriver command. Example 2018 workflows with this chaining are added: 10824.6,11024.6,11224.6.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to use PreRecHits for CaloTowers with this modifier, because the creation of CaloTowers relies on several HcalTopology functions that only work with the real topology, not the fake collapsed topology.\r\n\r\nThis PR cannot be fully tested until the above updated geometry is included in a GT. It was tested locally using `--geometry Extended2018` and the expected results were seen, i.e. only 3 depths in the final RecHit collection.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 11, "comments": 1, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1515768976", "deletions": 14, "labels": ["code-checks-pending", "comparison-pending", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending", "upgrade-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_0_X", "number": 21842, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Modifier & workflow for collapser for HE 2018 ", "updated_at": "1515768998", "user": "kpedro88"}

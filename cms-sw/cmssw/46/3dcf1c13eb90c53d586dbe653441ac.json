Currently, ScoutingNano only contain jets reclustered from scouting PF candidates which still have eta range |eta| < 3. Therefore, this allows ones to also access forward jets from scouting PF jets (clustered at HLT).\r\n    - With this addition, all scouting objects collected at HLT (except PF candidates and tracks) are included. This is useful for regular object performance monitoring and trigger efficiency studies, for instance.\r\n- remove tasks related to TrigObj table\r\n    - Scouting objects are, by definition, trigger objects (TrigObj).\r\n    - ```patTriggerScouting``` step in producing TrigObj table causes very noisy log (```trigger::TriggerEvent product with InputTag 'hltTriggerSummaryAOD::HLT' not in event``` for every event). This issue was raised by O&C (https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/44970#issuecomment-2213462892). This is caused by missing ```hltTriggerSummaryAOD::HLT``` in ScoutingPFRun3 RAW/HLTSCOUT samples.\r\n    - In fact, TrigObj table never gets produced because [triggerObjectTableScouting](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/PhysicsTools/NanoAOD/python/custom_run3scouting_cff.py#L48) is dropped from event content as specified in [NanoAODEventContent](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/PhysicsTools/NanoAOD/python/NanoAODEDMEventContent_cff.py#L6) as the producer doesn't end with \"Table\" suffix.\r\n    - Hence, we consider removing TrigObj table and related tasks to solve noisy log file.\r\n- minor fixes\r\n    - change ```_lambda``` to ```lambda_``` for ```ScoutingTrack``` collection so the output branch name is ```ScoutingTrack_lambda_``` instead of ```Scouting__lambda``` in root file.\r\n    - change branch names and docs for jets to clearly distinguish between jets clustered at HLT and reclustered ones.\r\n    - fix typo particlenet_uds to particleNet_uds to match other particleNet branches in reclustered AK4 jets.\r\n    - fix incorrect orders of particleNet branches in reclustered AK8 jets to match [preprocess.json](https://github.com/cms-data/RecoBTag-Combined/blob/master/Run3Scouting/ParticleNetAK8/General/V00/preprocess.json#L2-L6).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nEvent sizes are measured with relval_nano matrix for ScoutingNano: \r\n- 0.88 kb/event (2500.131 ScoutingPFRun32022RAW13.0+scoutingNANO_data13.0)\r\n- 1.14 kb/event (2500.237 ScoutingPFRun32024RAW14.0+scoutingNANO_data14.0)\r\n- 1.86 kb/event (2500.227 TTbarMINIAOD14.0+scoutingNANO_mc14.0)\r\n\r\nFor full size reports, please refer to [1].\r\n\r\nIn addition, this PR pass all standard unit tests ```scram b runtests```\r\n```\r\nPass   13s ...

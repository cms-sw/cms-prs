Those tracks used to (re)fit tau vertex result with a vertex with an undefined position (reco::Vertex::Point(nan,nan,nan)), but claiming to be a valid transient vertex. This PR protects against such issues - ill-defined tracks are not used for the fit and vertices with invalid position are not used for further processing.\r\n\r\nThis PR has not impact on official workflows, while it fixes issue causing failures in the tauReco@mini (unoffical) workflow.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n* Validated with tauReco@mini (unofficial) workflow that failures observed with original code are fixed.\r\n* Matrix tests (`runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos`) successful (with master).\r\n\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nBackport of #31582 to 10_6_X for processing existing and UL (re)MiniAOD samples.", "branch": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1601940387", "comments": 19, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1601043428", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["backport-ok", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "038bee11edf426452737bd0f22ad2dd4678811dd", "merged_at": "1601940387", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 31585, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Protect against ill-defined track momenta and reffited tau vertices for tauReco@mini (10_6_X)", "updated_at": "1601940388", "user": "mbluj"}

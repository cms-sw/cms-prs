This PR fixes the issue. These are the tags from which the DQM GUI reads the list of known problematic towers in ECAL and displays them as dark red/dark yellow vs red/yellow.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nPR is validated by running a local test which successfully creates an sqlite file which is uploaded to the DB and verified with an online DQM run on a test DQM GUI. Everything looks as expected.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\nBackport of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/38357\r\nBackport needed to maintain continuity in production versions", "branch": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "changed_files": 6, "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1655121949", "deletions": 417, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 38360, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Changes to update the offline DB tags EcalDQMTowerStatus_v1_hlt and EcalDQMChannelStatus_v1_hlt [12_3_X]", "updated_at": "1655207108", "user": "abhih1"}

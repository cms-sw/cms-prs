This is a first step to changing the base of `DQMEDAnalyzer` (likely to `EDProducer` or `edm::one::EDProducer`), which can then be used to run DQM unscheduled, improve concurrency and reduce memory consumption.\r\n\r\nRight now, this is a no-op and should not do anything, since the alias still points to `cms.EDAnalyzer` and the base class is not changed. The final conversion likely has to wait for an additional feature in the framework (thanks @Dr15Jones !).\r\n\r\nCaveats:\r\n- These changes were obviously done in an automated way, and not fully validated by hand.\r\n- The list of `DQMEDAnalyzer`s came form [cmssdt DXR](https://cmssdt.cern.ch/dxr/CMSSW_9_4_0/search?q=%2Bderived%3ADQMEDAnalyzer), which is CMSSW_9_4. I might have missed newer modules.\r\n- This PR will very quickly conflict with others. I can redo the changes fairly easily in that case, but this is the motivation to separate it from the functional changes.\r\n- This PR touches all `DQMEDAnalyzer`s, including those that are not typical online/offline/relval DQM. In case you use them for other purposes, please contact core DQM that we _know_ about you. Otherwise, we will likely break your application going ahead. \r\n\r\nThis is related to issue #15866. It is similar to #18751 in terms of changes.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 491, "comments": 1, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1516178789", "deletions": 714, "labels": ["alca-pending", "analysis-pending", "code-checks-pending", "comparison-pending", "dqm-pending", "fastsim-pending", "generators-pending", "geometry-pending", "hlt-pending", "l1-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending", "upgrade-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_0_X", "number": 21871, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Introduce an alias for DQMEDAnalyzer", "updated_at": "1516178819", "user": "schneiml"}

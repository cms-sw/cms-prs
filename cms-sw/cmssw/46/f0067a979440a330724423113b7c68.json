The problem with edmClassVersion needs to be fixed separately, because the checksum it calculates can depend on build order of the packages.\nThis pull request supplies the missing dependency, and updates the checksum accordingly.\nPlease expedite this critical pull request, bypassing signatures if not signed in a timely manner.\nHowever, do not bypass testing, comparisons, and all that!!\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1421867844", "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1421784256", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "e55dafa4557a7b85522c89d0a74e72051634e568", "merged_at": "1421867844", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 7291, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add mssing link dependency and fix checksum", "updated_at": "1422038661", "user": "wmtan"}

As the name suggests, it is dEtaIn but computed using the eta of the seed cluster rather than the supercluster. It is simply dEtaIn-sc eta + seed eta. I have added a function to GsfElectron which makes it, it would be nice if we could have this, it just simplifies things and avoids mistakes but we can live without.\n\nI have also added a class to the ID framework which can cut on this variable. \n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_3_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1415639813", "comments": 6, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1415562371", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "825ebd0f1d15fc104d49fdc13b37661310911bcd", "merged_at": "1415639813", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_3_X", "number": 6300, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Making dEtaIn seed available for ID purposes", "updated_at": "1415639814", "user": "Sam-Harper"}

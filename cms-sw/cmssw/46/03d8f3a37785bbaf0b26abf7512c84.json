New functionality allows to plot hit/residual-specific distributions (e.g. hit resolution, cluster width, track-hit-residual resolution) for specific sectors. These distributions are already produced by the APE tool, but so far there was no tool that read them out. They might be useful for debugging purposes or for tuning hit selection criteria.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested with one file from a previous measurement. \r\n\r\nProbably does not need backports, as the changes are not critical to the functionality of the tool. \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1699623656", "comments": 12, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1699281425", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["alca-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved", "trk"], "merge_commit_sha": "22cac869eff06bb0473095d8176ec200dadbcc90", "merged_at": "1699623656", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "number": 43202, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "APE tool: Hit validation plots added", "updated_at": "1699623657", "user": "mteroerd"}

To save space the jet daughters are used to store both subjets and jet constituents. In order to compute e.g. jet ID or substructure observables, the jet constituents are needed, which can currently be obtained by collecting the constituents of all subjet daughters of the jet plus the non-subjet daughters of the jet.\r\nTo make this much simpler for the user, propose to adapt the pat jet interface to perform this operation automatically.\r\nThe user can the consistently obtain subjets via the member function subjets() and constituent particles via the member function daughter().\r\nThis does not change any content of RECO or MiniAOD, it only changes the interface to jets with subjets.\r\n@arizzi @gpetruc @rappoccio Please have a look.\r\nSuggest to backport this to all analysis releases if agreed.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 8, "comments": 25, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1523348097", "deletions": 41, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 22914, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "open", "title": "Simplify jet constituent access in MiniAOD", "updated_at": "1523877010", "user": "ahinzmann"}

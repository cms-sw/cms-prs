In addition, it should be completely **adiabatic** for **DATA** RECO tasks. It is however expected to see some small differences in the MC DIGI production to the level of 10^-5 in the ECAL Digi Pulse Shape.  As a result, some of the rechits in Phase-I MC might slightly change in terms of energy/time but these changes are expected to be very small, numerically noticeable but not important in terms of physics.\r\n\r\nthe main updates are described here:\r\n\r\n    https://indico.cern.ch/event/731948/ (slide 4)\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 12, "comments": 62, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1535619752", "deletions": 35, "labels": ["alca-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-pending", "l1-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_3_X", "number": 24415, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 12, "state": "open", "title": "activating usage of EcalSimPulseShapeRcd (>= 10_3_X)", "updated_at": "1536941337", "user": "theofil"}

It is needed now since HLT menus have started to introduce the `options` PSet in ConfDB mainly as a way to control GPU offloading via `options.accelerators`.\r\n> \r\n> In recent CMSSW releases (`CMSSW_11` and higher), the options `PSet` exists by default in the `cms.Process` and the types of its variables do not need to be specified (even if `process.options` is not explictly defined in the python config), so those type specifications are dropped.\r\n> \r\n> This PR will be backported to `12_4_X`. I'd also suggest to also backport it to `12_3_X` for convenience, since there are recent online menus for `12_3_X` which define the `options` PSet in `ConfDB`.\r\n> \r\n> _Note_ : [the `options` PSet continues to be removed when the HLT configuration is downloaded as a \"fragment\"](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/b54d06d5447f6bb55d1da6c42d3a413f526150a0/HLTrigger/Configuration/python/Tools/confdb.py#L859). When using HLT fragments via `cmsDriver.py`, `options.accelerators` can be configured via `cmsDriver.py --accelerators [..]`.\r\n> \r\n> Merely technical.

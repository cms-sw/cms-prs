One imagines that moving the majority of relval workflows to AOD would be beneficial to disk load of release validation (a factor in reduction from RECO to AOD).\r\n\r\nAs the primary responsible of these workflows, we brought this up with @cms-sw/pdmv-l2\r\nThey tend to agree that it doesn't make sense to have all real data wfs write RECO (it's not the case for MC), but suggested we bring the issue to a wider audience\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested that RelVal workflows affected run fine and produce AOD output", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 0, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1701454549", "deletions": 77, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "number": 43478, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[RFC] Change output from RECO to AOD in Run3 Data RelVal wfs", "updated_at": "1701454599", "user": "jfernan2"}

It is intended as an illustration of design choices alternative to https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/37602 that may be useful (or not) in later improvements of the code, that I and @Dr15Jones hacked together in parallel to the recent updates in #37602 (in part to gain better understanding of the code). The main differences wrt. #37602 \r\n* The map of strings to writer objects is within `DataWriterExt` instead of `L1CondDBPayloadWriterExt`\r\n* It makes an attempt to handle the \"data product already exists in the target DB\" case (that is currently broken)\r\n  * I believe the data product existence check could be achieved in simpler means, the approach chosen here was to minimize structural changes (given the time pressure).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 13, "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1650412224", "deletions": 79, "labels": ["l1-pending", "db-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 37628, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[RFC] Migrate L1CondDBPayloadWriterExt to esConsumes", "updated_at": "1650446558", "user": "makortel"}

To fix the saturation effect, the total energy of TPs is forced to be saturated when the saturation in the input LUT is found before the sum over depths and the peak finder algorithm. This is achieved in the implementation by having the map of saturated towers in `HcalTriggerPrimitiveAlgo` and check the saturation after the peak finder algorithm, to make the TP energy saturated if the saturation is found at the input level. This PR is only applicable for a Run3 condition and can be toggled off by the parameter `applySaturationFix` in `simHcalTriggerPrimitiveDigis`.

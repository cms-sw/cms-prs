Also, the method names now adhere to the CMS naming rules. \r\n\r\nAt some point, the tool should probably be rewritten to use dagman instead of submitting and retrieving jobs in interactive mode.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI executed the program with an example configuration and made sure it ran as expected. All changes should be transparent.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 14, "comments": 29, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1687177233", "deletions": 675, "labels": ["alca-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-rejected", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "trk"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_2_X", "number": 42012, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Ape python3fix", "updated_at": "1687350693", "user": "mteroerd"}

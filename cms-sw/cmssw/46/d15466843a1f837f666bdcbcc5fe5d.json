Also, the method names now adhere to the CMS naming rules. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, added unit test functionality and removed the need to add the package Alignment/TrackerAlignment whenever a measurement is to be performed.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI executed the program with an example configuration and made sure it ran as expected. All changes should be transparent.\r\nAlso, a unit test can now be run to validate the PR.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 14, "comments": 32, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1687177233", "deletions": 675, "labels": ["alca-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "trk"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_2_X", "number": 42012, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "APE measurement tool: Resolved python3 compatibility issues, added unit test functionality, removed dependency on other package", "updated_at": "1687414484", "user": "mteroerd"}

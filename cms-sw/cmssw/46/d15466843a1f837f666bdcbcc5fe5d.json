Also, the method names now adhere to the CMS naming rules. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, added unit test functionality and removed the need to add the package Alignment/TrackerAlignment whenever a measurement is to be performed.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI executed the program with an example configuration and made sure it ran as expected. All changes should be transparent.\r\nAlso, a unit test can now be run to validate the PR.\r\n\r\n####  If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\nWill be backported to 13_0_X and 13_1_X", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 14, "closed_at": "1687699155", "comments": 38, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1687177233", "deletions": 675, "labels": ["alca-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved", "trk"], "merge_commit_sha": "95f953ed8dcb728e501170a8e99cb1a5b88c02f2", "merged_at": "1687699155", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_13_2_X", "number": 42012, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "APE measurement tool: Resolved python3 compatibility issues, added unit test functionality, removed dependency on other package", "updated_at": "1687699156", "user": "mteroerd"}

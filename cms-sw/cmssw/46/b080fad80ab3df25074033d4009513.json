With respect to the current way of handling errors, which is maintained via the `isActive()` method\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/754d4fbc8bf3e05df6de16937fe6f4d30f5d8699/RecoEgamma/EgammaElectronAlgos/src/TrajSeedMatcher.cc#L356\r\n\r\nthe new method allows us to catch cases where the flagging happens on a per-event basis (i.e., no need to mask those modules permanently via SiPixelQualityRcd).\r\n\r\nIn addition, if in the future a 2023 MC will be made where the FED25 error is used to simulate the BPIX issue (e.g., via a probability function), with these changes the online electron reconstruction code should be able to handle it correctly.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI observed an improvement in efficiency for electron triggers (such as HLT_Ele32_WPTight_Gsf) when running them with the proposed changes. The sample used for the test was a DY simulation where the issue in the faulty BPIX modules in layers 3 and 4 in 2023 was simulated at the level of the digitizer (i.e., the channels corresponding to the faulty modules produce an error FED25). Some plots can be found [here](https://cernbox.cern.ch/s/iB7yjoSbo3ne3Uf). Please note that the efficiencies are calculated using gen-level electrons and basically no selection, so on an absolute scale they can look low.\r\n\r\nThe PR also passed some basic runTeMatrix tests.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1702398340", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending", "tracking", "egamma"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "number": 43555, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Integrate FED25 handling in electron online reconstruction", "updated_at": "1702398566", "user": "RSalvatico"}

This is very rare and requires very energetic photons/jets (typically >500 GeV)\r\n\r\n* Impacts other PRs: no to my knowledge\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nLocal production of approx. 2k events of photon gun events with E=500 GeV, uniform in pseudo-rapidity\r\n\r\nDIGIs in TDC mode before the fix (sample 1):\r\n![DIGIs in TDC mode before the fix](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4624574/76448712-13356a00-63cb-11ea-8854-c91074c598bb.png)\r\n\r\nDIGIs in TDC mode after the fix (sample 2):\r\n![DIGIs in TDC mode after the fix](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4624574/76448604-e5e8bc00-63ca-11ea-9d0d-6c892d2b371f.png)", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1584003667", "comments": 14, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1583946348", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "ef8b28af1cd02db6546766c8de4381c8ead20422", "merged_at": "1584003667", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 29186, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "avoiding overflow in TDC regime", "updated_at": "1584003667", "user": "pfs"}

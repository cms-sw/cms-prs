This is extremely intrusive and breaks encapsulation.\n\nThis does not work anymore with new libstdc++ libraries, because foward\ndelcaration of struct is implicitly private and then implementation is\nunder explicit private clause. Redefining 'private' only change one of\nthem thus creating compile-time errors in sstream.\n\nDetails in PR65899 (GCC BZ). It's WONTFIX.\n\nSuch cleanups are required for GCC 5 and above.\n\nSigned-off-by: David Abdurachmanov David.Abdurachmanov@cern.ch\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1445668397", "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1445251862", "deletions": 7, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "visualization-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "d2a57c631a8041d25ea751dc7d11b2bdaed8fc03", "merged_at": "1445668397", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 11957, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fireworks/Core: remove intrusive macros breaking libstdc++", "updated_at": "1445668397", "user": "davidlt"}

Commits 5d50378 and \r\ne514a31 are cherry-picked from the PR to master. The 10_6_X branch requires an additional two changes of the beamspot scenario, in commit 662b68c. Finally, the global tags are updated in commit 5ea966a. The changes to the GTs can be understood by comparing the diffs with respect to the previous 10_6_X autoCond GTs or by comparison with those in master.\r\n\r\n_**Comparison with previous 10_6_X GT**_\r\n\r\n**2016 design MC**\r\nUpdated to use ideal beamspot\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/106X_mcRun2_design_v6/106X_mcRun2_design_v7\r\n**2016 preVFP pp collision MC**\r\nUpdated to use 25ns beamspot rather than 50ns beamspot.

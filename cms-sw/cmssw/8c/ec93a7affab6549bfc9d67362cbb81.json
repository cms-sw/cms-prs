The new word spans 97 bits, and is padded with zeroes to span 128 bits (evenly spanning two 64-bit link data words). The tktriplet emulation plugin finds the three highest pT tracks in an event, computes the invariant mass from them, and fills the output word with the aforementioned nonzero fields.\r\n\r\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/1588031/\r\n- See the above indico page for a talk regarding the W->3pi updates \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTests have been done to ensure that the output tktriplet word is correctly written in APX board format. The word currently spans the first two 64-bit link words of each event on link 2, and tests using HLS firmware have shown that the invariant mass and triplet track pT fields can be correctly decoded from the test vectors.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

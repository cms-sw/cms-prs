This PR aims to integrate this in the release.\r\n\r\nThe plugin itself is rather simple: it's a (templated) producer that adds to the event the multiplicity value of a given EDM collection.\r\n\r\nIt is used in the current Phase-2 HLT to get the multiplicity of pixel clusters; that value, in turn, is used as PU-proxy input to the PUPPI producer in Phase-2 HLT studies (see https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/32341 for the relevant update to PUPPI).\r\n\r\nAt the moment, the only application of this is the HLT Phase-2 menu in the context of Jets/MET reconstruction, so I'm tentatively adding this plugin to `HLTrigger/JetMET`.\r\n\r\nAttn: @fwyzard @trtomei\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested with user workflows for Phase-2 HLT TDR studies.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nBackport of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/33204", "branch": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1616109521", "comments": 12, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1616005442", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["fully-signed", "hlt-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "b3da19b7e9e2db6124ecd2c9f71a0429d665b073", "merged_at": "1616109521", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 33205, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "[11_1_X] adding MultiplicityValueProducer* plugins (HLT Phase-2 TDR)", "updated_at": "1616109522", "user": "missirol"}

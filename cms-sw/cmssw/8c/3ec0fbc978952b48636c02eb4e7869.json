While we have not seen a precedent case that yields the abort signal reported in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/40032 coming from this particular producer (`TemplatedSecondaryVertexProducer.cc`), the logic is essentially same, so we think we should include the fixes here for safety purposes as well.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTests have been performed for CMSSW_12_4_10_patch3 (https://cms-sw.github.io/PRWorkflow.html)\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

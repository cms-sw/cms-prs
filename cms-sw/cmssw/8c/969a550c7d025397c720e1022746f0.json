The indeterminate nature could be because one Path has modules in the proper data dependency order while a second Path has them in the wrong order. Depending on which Path runs first you could get a different answer.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "changed_files": 10, "closed_at": "1393427393", "comments": 10, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1393344362", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "3fd3724de37d7119e6412be1c765385c51a79488", "merged_at": "1393427393", "merged_by": "nclopezo", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_1_0_pre5", "number": 2635, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Check for unrunnable schedules", "updated_at": "1394439751", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

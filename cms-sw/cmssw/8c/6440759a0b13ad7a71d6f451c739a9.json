This PR enhances the output of this test. First, floating-point values close to zero are rounded to zero to prevent minor fluctuations of very tiny values from showing up as differences. Second, each line is labeled with a sub-detector name so it is easier to identify differences between two geometry descriptions.\r\n\r\nFurther improvements in this test might be desirable. It is still vulnerable to re-arrangements of identical descriptions.\r\n\r\nThis test is not used in production or in unit tests.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTest output is now somewhat easier to read.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1584435034", "comments": 12, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1583952779", "deletions": 50, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "db-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "b98829e6384764ff787d517715528b7841dc9f07", "merged_at": "1584435034", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 29189, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Enhance formatting of special geometry test", "updated_at": "1584435034", "user": "cvuosalo"}

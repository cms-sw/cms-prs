This is a continuation of PR #28101 (https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/28101), which was closed last year to allow for time to restructure the code. \r\n\r\nIn particular, the code has been refactored to no longer have an EDProducer as the product of an ESProducer. As before, this PR only integrates the reconstruction code but leaves it deactivated. When activated, this PR adds a new tracking iteration \"pixelLess\" to the phase 2 tracking targeting displaced tracks.\r\n\r\nThe code changes of this PR have been tested on 100 Events of the 27434.1 workflow in a recent IB. As expected, the tracking results are identical as the Vector Hits are inactive. This can be seen in the validation results here: https://jschulte.web.cern.ch/jschulte/VH_11_2_X/plots/plots_summary.html\r\n\r\nThe integration strategy for the VectorHits was last discussed at a TRK POG meeting last year: https://indico.cern.ch/event/847559/contributions/3572893/attachments/1914802/3165228/VectorHits_status_sept25.pdf.\r\nHowever, the statements in those slides are still valid. A new assessment of the performance of the Vector Hits will be provided with the follow-up PR to activate them. \r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n - Compiliation after checking out all dependencies was sucessful\r\n\r\n -  Passes runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos without errors\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nFinal performance after code review, tested on 100 ttbar events at PU 200:\r\n\r\n- All tracks:\r\n          Efficiency: 0.9122 -> 0.9292\r\n         Fake rate: 0.1240 -> 0.0324\r\n         Duplicate rate: 0.0045 -> 0.0064\r\n- High purity tracks:\r\n         Efficiency: 0.9054 -> 0.9204\r\n         Fake rate:  0.0549 -> 0.0153\r\n         Duplicate rate:  0.0038 -> 0.0048\r\n\r\nEfficiency gain is mostly located at low pT and efficiencies converge at around 10 GeV\r\nLow pT fake rate is significantly reduced\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4459228/96197883-da3d1500-0f18-11eb-94c1-d85513309652.png)\r\n\r\nPR significantly improves sensitivity to tracks with moderate displacement\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4459228/96198005-2d16cc80-0f19-11eb-8796-0c42ec21f057.png)\r\n\r\nWith the current implementation this comes at a timing cost of about 20% for the tracking-only RECO step\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4459228/96198113-854dce80-0f19-11eb-83aa-f8ca4bd39bf5.png)\r\nHere the pixelLess iteration accounts for 40% of the total pattern recognition time, which can be improved with improvements to the seeding.

Either per RP (~ local-track level) or per sensor plane (~ rec hit level). These features aim at facilitating various POG and DPG oriented studies, respectively. The efficiencies are applied to tracking and timing RPs in an uniform manner.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTechnical validation - comparisons before-after this PR:\r\n  * [reco_cmp.pdf](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/files/5909831/reco_cmp.pdf): Run2 data reco workflows - no difference, as expected\r\n  * [dirsim_cmp.pdf](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/files/5909830/dirsim_cmp.pdf): direct simulation workflows - no difference, as expected - the new features are not enabled by default.\r\n\r\nFunctional validation kindly done by @AndreaBellora . The direct simulation is run with the following efficiency map (artificial):\r\n![input](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17830858/106575315-3bc2d700-653c-11eb-9cb6-6e59e479aa3d.png)\r\nThe efficiency extracted from the simulation output:\r\n![output](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17830858/106575318-3cf40400-653c-11eb-92fc-7a3341cf0a4a.png)\r\nis well compatible with the input.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1612484488", "comments": 9, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1612252743", "deletions": 75, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "beb7236c17fe2264cdf8258d4d903bf8012b0cd6", "merged_at": "1612484488", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 32788, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "PPS direct simulation: optional efficiency effects", "updated_at": "1612484488", "user": "jan-kaspar"}

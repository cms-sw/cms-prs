The default workflows (xxxxx.0) have still the emulation of IT signal shape OFF.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the PR has been discussed in the Tracker Phase-2 simulation meeting:\r\n- motivation for the choice of the new tof window: slide 3 of [this talk](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1242571/contributions/5222206/subcontributions/420756/attachments/2622169/4533947/em20230331.pdf)\r\n-  effect on the occupancy of the new tof window or of the activation of the IT signal shape:  slide 1 of [this talk](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1242571/contributions/5222206/subcontributions/420756/attachments/2622169/4538628/em20230331-extras.pdf). On average, the effect on the occupancy (DIGI level) due to this change is expected to be limited.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe PR has been validated running the phase-2 w/f 25061.0 (reference) and 25061.141 (IT signal shape ON).\r\n\r\nIt can be tested with the w/f 24834.0 (default) and 24834.141 (IT signal shape ON)\r\n\r\n#### \r\n\r\nThis PR is not a backport.\r\n\r\n@suchandradutta @mmusich @zdemirag \r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "comments": 13, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1680617573", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["simulation-approved", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-approved", "trk"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_1_X", "number": 41273, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 5, "state": "open", "title": "redefine IT digitizer ToF window + add customize fcn for activating IT signal shape with RelVals", "updated_at": "1680967456", "user": "emiglior"}

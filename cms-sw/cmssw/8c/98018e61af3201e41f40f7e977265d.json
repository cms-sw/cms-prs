It would be nice to get these trivial changes merged quickly so I can rebase the ProcessBlock pull request on top of them.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRelies on existing unit tests. The fact that it compiles is likely sufficient to test this as it only deletes things.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 8, "closed_at": "1625780887", "comments": 7, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1625754645", "deletions": 61, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "fa782b0e9ed9326609d90bf9085ee7298262de64", "merged_at": "1625780887", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "number": 34406, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Delete some unused code in the Core packages", "updated_at": "1625780887", "user": "wddgit"}

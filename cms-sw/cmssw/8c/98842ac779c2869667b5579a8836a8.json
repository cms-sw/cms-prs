I do not know how to test this module\nas nothing else in CMSSW references it.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1393917485", "comments": 29, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1392760249", "deletions": 56, "labels": ["alca-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "93277f5d4e957f17e5e4e498b6ebdf5460995e5d", "merged_at": "1393917485", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_1_0_pre5", "number": 2523, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Migrate Calibration Code to New Random Service Interface", "updated_at": "1398450003", "user": "wddgit"}

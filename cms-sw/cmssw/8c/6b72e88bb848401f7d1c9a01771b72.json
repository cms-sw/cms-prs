In 75X for pp reference run we ended up making edits in the actual release.\r\nGiven that special settings are applicable to both data and MC, it is more appropriate to have them set up using eras.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 29, "closed_at": "1478020032", "comments": 9, "commits": 9, "created_at": "1477969100", "deletions": 266, "labels": ["comparison-available", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "3ae4c6984375b32d615cf735f822245ba17ce6b1", "merged_at": "1478020032", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 16405, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": " new T0 scenario ppEra_Run2_2016_pA; migration of customise_PPwithHI to eras (fw port of #16394)", "updated_at": "1478020032", "user": "slava77"}

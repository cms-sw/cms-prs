The plugin attempts to read a jet corrector from an event even when the corrector is never used (which is the case when the flag `addResidualJES` is set to false).\n\nThe problem was introduced in commit b89c7e0f863706799d7603f658edbb2ad01580a3. In commit 745d210cbf0b0dbd346c5ad5475f069b3839e88e it was fixed for accessing one of the two jet correctors but not the other.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1479228020", "comments": 1, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1449757841", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 12748, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix a bug in ShiftedJetProducerT", "updated_at": "1479228020", "user": "andrey-popov"}

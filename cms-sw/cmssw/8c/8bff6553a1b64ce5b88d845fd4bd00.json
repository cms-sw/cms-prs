This is now extended to also OMTF and EMTF muons. This will mostly have an effect on the DQM, removing uGMT data-emulator mismatches during cosmics data taking. (cc @pmandrik; I will also create backports to 12_4_X and 12_3_X imminently and would request deployment to the online DQM if everything is fine.)\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRan on RAW data locally and confirmed that the index bit mismatches went away.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1656574689", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1656390647", "deletions": 10, "labels": ["l1-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "24831aabd6f3be2c18c31d453c75369c6d236f8c", "merged_at": "1656574688", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 38532, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix bug in muon index bit computation", "updated_at": "1656574689", "user": "dinyar"}

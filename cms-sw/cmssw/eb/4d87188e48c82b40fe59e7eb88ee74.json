Specific code is needed (TrackingParticle selector for cosmics, parameter definer of cosmics to have the TrackingParticle pars at the point of closest approach to the beam spot, code in associators and track validator) that is already integrated (in both 75X and 74X) from the previous PR. Before the existing code was able to compile but did not run.\nSo by including it we would check also part of the validation code during the normal release integration cycle.\n\ncheers,\n   Giovanni\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1433928973", "comments": 18, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1432651643", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "f5204df01ce93f29638d207dc1237fe9d382b774", "merged_at": "1433928973", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 9279, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "complete the recoMuon validation workflow for cosmic muons", "updated_at": "1433939443", "user": "abbiendi"}

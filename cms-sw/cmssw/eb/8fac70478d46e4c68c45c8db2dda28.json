The following changes are implemented:\r\n* Track to PV association is preformed in similar way as for tracks contained in `packedPFCandidates` collection (packed PF particles);\r\n* Detailed track information is stored down to 0.5GeV instead of current 0.95GeV as done for packed PF particles (`packedPFCandidates`). Track covariance packing schemas are adapted from producer of the packed PF particle collection for more effective packing.\r\n\r\nMiniAOD size changes were estimated with 1k of DY->LL evens with 2018 conditions and it is as follows:\r\n* size increase of `patPackedCandidates_lostTracks__PAT`: 23%\r\n* size increase of full miniAOD sample: 0.2%\r\n* 1/4 if the increase comes from updated PV association information, while remaining 3/4 from lowering threshold to store detailed track info.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested with standard miniAOD workflow. \r\nMatrix tests (`runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos`) successful.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1606431608", "comments": 54, "commits": 8, "created_at": "1606130832", "deletions": 44, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved", "xpog-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "d3acff5d24808e853803b7210b23ff004f27cbe4", "merged_at": "1606431608", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 32242, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 15, "state": "closed", "title": "Expand track information in lostTracks collection", "updated_at": "1606431608", "user": "mbluj"}

It was supposed to save a payload every time one of some variables change. Because of the bug, for some variables it was not saving the payload despite the change of the vaule.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nValidated by:\r\n1. running the PopCon script (LHCInfoPopConAnalyzerEndFill.py) for the fill 9019, producing local sqlite files with the payloads\r\n2.  comparing the contents of the produced files with the data for fill 9019 from PPS-DB\r\n\r\n#### Backport:\r\n\r\nIt's going to be backported to CMSSW_13_2_X , CMSSW_13_1_X  and CMSSW_13_0_X\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 24, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1690290311", "deletions": 167, "labels": ["db-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "bug-fix", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_3_X", "number": 42360, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "open", "title": "fixed comparePayloads in LHCInfo* PopCons", "updated_at": "1690538059", "user": "JanChyczynski"}

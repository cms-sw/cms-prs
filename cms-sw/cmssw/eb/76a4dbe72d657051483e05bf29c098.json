This pull request replaces an obsoleted call with a call to the new function.\nPlease merge this request for the same IB in which ROOT6 is being updated to the HEAD of the patches branch, as the changes are mutually dependent.\nIf this request is merged without updating ROOT6, a compilation error will result.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_3_ROOT6_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1415901761", "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1415898478", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "core-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "1b2dcb4314f13a8f6a9c4efeb9f210fdd08515c9", "merged_at": "1415901761", "merged_by": "davidlt", "number": 6382, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Use new function TEnum::GetQualifiedName()", "updated_at": "1416863019", "user": "wmtan"}

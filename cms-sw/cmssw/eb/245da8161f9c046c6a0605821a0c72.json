Track candidate buffers are sized by a new `CountSurvivingTCs` kernel, replacing hardcoded caps. Pixel module buffers are likewise allocated to their actual input sizes. Also, unused SoA fields are put behind a compile-time flag to reduce per-element buffer sizes. Lastly, an extra cut is included in one of the existing sizing kernels to reduce the buffer size for T3s in LST. Timing and physics performance are unchanged on both CPU and GPU backends.\r\n\r\nThis table is an average over 10 events.\r\n<img width=\"700\" alt=\"Screenshot 2026-02-15 at 1 46 36PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30da2099-1fb3-4823-8f21-1113571626c0\" />\r\n\r\nc.c. @slava77 ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 20, "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1771284720", "deletions": 209, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "tracking"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_1_X", "number": 50157, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Memory Improvements for LST", "updated_at": "1771342626", "user": "GNiendorf"}

It's an outline of a WIP effort to have ntuples for machine learning based reconstruction in HGCAL in the NanoAOD framework.\r\n\r\nML efforts generally need ~flat trees. Normally we cook up a simple ntuplizer with an EDAnlayzer. But configs like those in this PR are much more readable and can easily be shared---i.e., schedule this config snippet instead of copy/paste these lines of C++ code. I'm curious if there is any interest to support this centrally. Recently discussed with @bendavid on the PF side, who is in favor.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 35, "closed_at": "1616423819", "comments": 41, "commits": 17, "created_at": "1605818181", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "generators-pending", "new-package-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "tests-rejected", "xpog-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 32187, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 21, "state": "closed", "title": "[RFC] Outline of HGCAL ML ntuples using NanoAOD", "updated_at": "1616423819", "user": "kdlong"}

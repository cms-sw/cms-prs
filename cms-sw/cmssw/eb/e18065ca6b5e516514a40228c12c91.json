This was traced down to wrong assignment of the ID's from position. Most likely while introducing the cassette concept, the conversion between SIM/RECO unit was disturbed. That led to wrong assignment of DetId's. This is cured by this PR. In the process, possible shifts due to cassette positioning etc are rightly handled now. Most of the codes are used for debugging while a very small fraction is used in the fix.\r\n\r\nSince it is a bug fix the comparison plots for many phase2 scenarios will look different\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nUse several phase2 runTheMatrix test workflows\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

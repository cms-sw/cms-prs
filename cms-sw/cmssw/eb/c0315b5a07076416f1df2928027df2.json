New values at ieta=0 are closer to the real values, so that a color gradient will provide information.\r\nIn EcalPedestals_PayloadInspector, for the EBMean, a value of 200 near the reality has been chosen. For the EBRMS, 2 for G12, 1 for G1 and 0.5 for G1 are more adapted.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested in local with CondCore/Utilities/scripts/getPayloadData.py : Json file produced with values as expected at ieta=0\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 10, "comments": 4, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1699975031", "deletions": 18, "labels": ["db-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved", "ecal"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "number": 43272, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "ECAL : DB PayloadInspector improvement", "updated_at": "1699988210", "user": "depasse"}

Also, the third position of the so-called \"navType\" (_nt2) was updated from 4 to 6. This change occurred in XML during 11_2 development, but it never made it to the DB until now.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nGeometry validation talk in the Simulation meeting: https://indico.cern.ch/event/1071938/#56-progress-report-on-dd4hep-m\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nThis is not a backport but a backport to 12_0_X is expected\r\n\r\ncc @cvuosalo @srimanob ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 14, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1631653659", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["alca-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "number": 35277, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Include new geometry tags in Run-3 MC GTs", "updated_at": "1631728901", "user": "tvami"}

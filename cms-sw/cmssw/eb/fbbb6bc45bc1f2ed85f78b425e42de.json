A customization function has been provided (`injectTICLintoPF`) in order to swap the _sim-Assisted_ reconstruction in HGCAL with the one coming from TICL.\r\n\r\nNon-optimal performances on complex events have to be expected out of the box (i.e. quite some development will have to be implemented on top of what is provided in this PR).\r\n\r\nResults based on the development contained in this PR have been shown at a recent `HGCAL DPG` Meeting: [link](https://indico.cern.ch/event/898159/contributions/3788061/attachments/2005643/3352469/lg-hgcdpg-20200318.pdf)\r\n\r\nA special thanks to @gouskos for helping during the development and testing phase.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe limited Matrix run w/o issues.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 40, "closed_at": "1586410360", "comments": 154, "commits": 74, "created_at": "1583244434", "deletions": 208, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "operations-approved", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "199f672f47fd7c177cc3dda3f7c6d2bce112c518", "merged_at": "1586410360", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 29081, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 33, "state": "closed", "title": "[HGCAL] TICL in reconstruction", "updated_at": "1586410360", "user": "rovere"}

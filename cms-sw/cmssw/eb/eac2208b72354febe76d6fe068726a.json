HLLHC-like vertex smearing, as was the default so far for such workflows, defies the purpose of the CloseByParticleGun. In practical terms: if we want to position the particle gun right in front of the detector (HGCAL), we do not want to have a vertex smearing applied that would move the position of the simulated vertex _into_ the detector, as this would bias our studies and mess with truth definitions etc. If a spread in Z position of the vertex is desired, this can be handled through the config of the CloseByParticleGun. \r\nHence, switch to a Gaussian Vertex smearing with width_x/y/z = 0 for all workflows using the CloseByParticleGun.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nedmConfigDump on step1.py for an upgrade workflow that would previously have the smearing applied, like: `runTheMatrix.py -w upgrade -l 34693.0 -t 10 -j 0 --command '-n 10'` shows that the desired configuration was fetched.\r\n\r\nVerified that GEN vertex and SIM vertex positions are identical for 10 events.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1627970407", "comments": 23, "commits": 11, "created_at": "1627538387", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "operations-approved", "orp-approved", "pdmv-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-approved", "tests-rejected", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "ad7d21a134bc27448f558f7b0f74dabd137c7184", "merged_at": "1627970407", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "number": 34681, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 9, "state": "closed", "title": "Disable vertex smearing for workflows using CloseByParticleGun", "updated_at": "1627970407", "user": "dr-stringfellow"}

This is the best possible validation of the correction made to the code. Running the code testHGCalSimSingleMuonPt100_cfg.py from Validation/HGCalValidation/scripts after activating the  printout option yielded 2218 | 542 cells with validity flag 0 for V16 | V17 geometries in the original version and after the correction, both the geometries yielded 0 such cells indicating that all SimHit cells now pass the validity tests \r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

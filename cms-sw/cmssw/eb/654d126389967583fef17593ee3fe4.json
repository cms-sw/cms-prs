It is only enabled for Millepede. If other alignment algorithms want to use it a flag has to be set to `True`:\r\n```\r\nprocess.AlignmentProducer.enableAlignableUpdates = True\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe code is based on top of #17408, i.e. to better digest the changes, it might be useful to first review and eventually approve #17408.\r\n\r\nEDIT: A dedicated presentation on this update has been given at the [Tracker Alignment meeting on 01-Mar-2017](https://indico.cern.ch/event/607508/contributions/2493829/attachments/1420329/2176319/Alignment-MultiIOV_CMS-TkAl_20170301.pdf)\nAutomatically ported from CMSSW_9_0_X #17475 (original by @ghellwig).\nPlease wait for a new IB (12 to 24H) before requesting to test this PR.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 53, "closed_at": "1488966322", "comments": 14, "commits": 29, "created_at": "1488454496", "deletions": 641, "labels": ["alca-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "a668435f4fc8b7814c9174116d1807cdd59700e7", "merged_at": "1488966322", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_1_X", "number": 17724, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "[90X] Allow multi-IOV input for Millepede alignment framework", "updated_at": "1493733192", "user": "cmsbuild"}

The chosen approach is to dump the TrackerTopology constants to the output root file, and use them in the python library. While it leads to some code duplication, it allows flexible debugging (including the TrackerTopology constants) without increasing the ntuple size (and if all the pieces of DetIds were stored on separate branches, one would have to deal with the fact that BPix/FPix and TIB/TID/TOB/TEC DetIds have different structure).\r\n\r\nTested in 9_1_0_pre2, no changes expected.\r\n\r\n@rovere @VinInn @ebrondol ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1493275571", "comments": 10, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1492597624", "deletions": 302, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_9_1_X", "number": 18403, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 10, "state": "closed", "title": "Generalize DetId parsing in TrackingNtuple", "updated_at": "1493275572", "user": "makortel"}

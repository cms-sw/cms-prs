This confuses my BuildFile/includes checker, which does not expect this entanglement between the library and the plugins. For these cases, I merged the plugin header with the `cc` file.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCMSSW compiles. It was checked that all newly added dependencies are actually required by the package with `git grep`.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 46, "closed_at": "1592307447", "comments": 23, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1591563674", "deletions": 511, "labels": ["alca-approved", "analysis-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "db-approved", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "pdmv-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "44c6637991f8d846da88ee1ea34d3bb52de611c4", "merged_at": "1592307447", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 30139, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Clean BuildFiles before DataFormats", "updated_at": "1592307447", "user": "guitargeek"}

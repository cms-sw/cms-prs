This includes a\ntemplate class to be used to create thinned collection\nproducers. It also includes code to automatically redirect\nRef's, Ptr's, RefVector's, PtrVector's and things derived\nfrom them to the thinned collections if the original\ncollections have been dropped. ThinnedAssociations and\na new table in the Framework are implemented to make\nthe redirection work. Keeping and dropping of the\nThinnedAssociations and table entries is handled automatically.\nThis includes code to make this work with Root I/O, Secondary\nfile input, secondary source, subprocesses, FWLite, EDAlias's,\nand Streamer I/O. There are new unit tests for all\nthose cases as well.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_3_X", "changed_files": 138, "closed_at": "1411659856", "comments": 13, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1411494218", "deletions": 373, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "core-approved", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "a0e0dc977b2d969731ae0e45cdbe770f8f931955", "merged_at": "1411659856", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_3_X", "number": 5515, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "New feature.

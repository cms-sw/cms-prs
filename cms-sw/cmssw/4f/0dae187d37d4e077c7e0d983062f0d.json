I removed those with the \"prefix\" pf and kept the original names as default.\nThis change is backward incompatible. I was told that it is allowed for the 73X series. \nIt has been tested with runTheMatrix.py -l 17.0\n1 1 1 1 tests passed, 0 0 0 0 failed\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_3_X", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": "1416383256", "comments": 24, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1415882419", "deletions": 67, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "7224db61be10ed6640c08a4d9de4777d0abaf445", "merged_at": "1416383256", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_3_X", "number": 6372, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "Df cleanup 2", "updated_at": "1500637518", "user": "beaudett"}

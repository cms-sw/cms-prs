The rings have been updated from 9 to 11, and the positions are now according to the provided spreadsheet.\r\nAn approximate description of the aluminum support plate is also added, with a 6 mm thick plate between rings and a restricted 3.4 mm plate within rings, in the space in between front and rear modules. The services description in tkLayout has not been modified. The module size now used in 95 x 49 mm.\r\n\r\nThe numbering scheme code has been adapted accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe ETL geometry remains free from overlaps (tested with Geant4 code), and the numbering scheme has been reverified with the test code. According to the Geant4 dump of SD positions, the ETL module are correctly placed.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 8, "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1529088596", "deletions": 946, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "new-package-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 23603, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "New ETL geometry with 11 rings based on engineering drawings, add approximate support plate", "updated_at": "1529116007", "user": "fabiocos"}

Buffers LHEReader IO along 16MB boundaries (both compressed and uncompressed cases).\n2.  Skips parsing of events that will be skipped.\n\nWhen testing (2), I found there was 1.8x speedup when reading compressed files and 1.9x speedup when reading uncompressed files.  This suggests, when there is efficient IO, we are dominated by XML parsing times (not decompression times).\n\n@davidlange6 @bendavid \n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1438091882", "comments": 8, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1437412773", "deletions": 91, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "fully-signed", "generators-approved", "orp-pending", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "7dcba55d7a390e2a6e9fb183e08d9fa8114feacf", "merged_at": "1438091882", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "number": 10287, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "Improve LHEReader IO (and optimize skipping events)", "updated_at": "1438282642", "user": "bbockelm"}

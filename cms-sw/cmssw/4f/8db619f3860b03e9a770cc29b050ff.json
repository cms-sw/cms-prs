This results from the fact that when CandViewMerger is used, the referening of the packedcandidates to the orignal leptons is somehow broken. PuppiPhoton relies on these references to remove the give pfcandidates assigned to a good photon weight 1. If this is broken Puppi photon will add back the missing candidates even if they are there. The solution is to either run puppi no lepton or puppiphoton, but not both. The problem with this is that puppi vs puppi no lepton will reduce the MET response by a 2-3% whereas puppiphoton vs puppi will make puppiMET robust in photon+jet events. We prfer to have puppi photon. On another note, after miniAOD is run, the puppinolepton weights attached to the packed candidates give weight 1 for the leptons, so puppiphoton can be run on the miniAOD using the precomputed puppinolepton weights allowing for the best puppiMET peformance.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1473669493", "comments": 50, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1472577452", "deletions": 16, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "b07e746263faa936ffb6983501d51ac7719b8d4d", "merged_at": "1473669493", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 15669, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "Update to fix late validation plots  from PR 15562", "updated_at": "1473669493", "user": "violatingcp"}

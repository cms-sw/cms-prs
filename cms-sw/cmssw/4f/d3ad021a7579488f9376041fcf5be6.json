The code is based on the reorganization of version D50, with the ETL xml description implemented manually by @icosivi (no more dependence on tkLayout) and a new DDMTDLinear algorithm (an extension of DDLinear) added (only for DDD, DD4hep version to follow).\r\n\r\nA numbering scheme is introduced, compatible with the existing ```ETLDetId```, which is updated with the addition of methods useful to navigate the new geometry (but formally backward compatible, although useless).\r\n\r\nThe reconstruction geometry will be adapted in a following PR, using this one as starting point.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe numbering scheme provides the desired description by running the ```TestMTDNumbering``` analyzer. @icosivi confirms that the positions shown by ```TestMTDPosition``` are the desired ones. The version committed passes the g4 overlap check without problems (details removed to avoid them need to be clarified with people implementing the engineering drawing). \r\n\r\nA presentation of the implementation can be found in https://indico.cern.ch/event/870274/contributions/3670170/attachments/1962036/3261490/F.Siviero_ETL-Geometry_12.13.2019.pdf and https://indico.cern.ch/event/870274/contributions/3670170/attachments/1962036/3261324/MTD_20191213.pdf (not the latest setup, but discussing the basic features).", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 19, "closed_at": "1580402349", "comments": 45, "commits": 15, "created_at": "1579879919", "deletions": 11, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "operations-approved", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "ecb4dfb2ae4e4ce2ff98a079cde945ff635b579c", "merged_at": "1580402349", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 28788, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 10, "state": "closed", "title": "MTD geometry: TDR ETL design (scenario D53)", "updated_at": "1580402350", "user": "fabiocos"}

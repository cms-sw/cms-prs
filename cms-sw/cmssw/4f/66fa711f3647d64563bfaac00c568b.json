This is particularly convenient because the empty expression list is very common in many `eventSetupPath` keys across different Global Tags and it would avoid to make massive clean-up campaign.\r\nWhile this PR changes the behaviour of the module I couldn't find any other consumers of it other than named AlCaReco producers, so it should be safe to do.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nUsed the configuration file obtained from the following cmsDriver command (borrowed from [this JIRA ticket](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/PDMVRELVALS-257) and the [stats2](https://cms-pdmv-prod.web.cern.ch/stats?prepid=CMSSW_14_1_6__Run3_2024HIN_noPU_RV257-DIGIHI2024-00002) link therein) that used to produce an empty dataset:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n#!/bin/bash -ex                                                                                                                                                                                            \r\n\r\ncmsDriver.py step3 \\\r\n             --conditions 141X_mcRun3_2024_realistic_HI_Candidate_2024_11_19_14_38_08 \\\r\n             --datatier ALCARECO \\\r\n             --era Run3_pp_on_PbPb_2023 \\\r\n             --eventcontent ALCARECO \\\r\n             --filein /store/relval/CMSSW_14_1_6/RelValHydjetQ_B12_5362GeV_2024/GEN-SIM-RECO/141X_mcRun3_2024_realistic_HI_Candidate_2024_11_19_14_38_08_MinBias_2024HIN_noPU_RV257-v2/2590000/0052ce44-83\\\r\nda-4782-b2f7-3e16e58e42be.root \\\r\n             --fileout file:step3.root \\\r\n             --nStreams 1 \\\r\n             --nThreads 8 \\\r\n             --no_exec \\\r\n             --number 100 \\\r\n             --python_filename step_3_cfg.py \\\r\n             --step ALCA:TkAlMinBias+SiStripCalMinBias\r\n```\r\n\r\nand verified that there are events in output, where the same command without this PR produces a file without any events in it.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

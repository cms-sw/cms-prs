Green curve correspond to reco nuclear interaction with old 2.2 cm cut (preliminary/fast vertex reconstruction) and blue curve to the new 1.8 cm cut. As you could see with blue we could reconstruct slightly more events with lower radius. We plot radius of nuclear interactions only in the region of beam pipe. \n\nWe want make precise measurements of the beam pipe in 2015, that is why we need introduce this change to avoid bias in beam pipe coordinates. \n\nI would like to ask for request to make this change in CMSSW_7_5_X and after propagate it to CMSSW_7_4_X. This change could be done for RUN II and RUN I at the same time, but we need it only for RUN II. \n\nThank you in advance, Anna\n\n![beampipeforrunii_3](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5188748/8059307/8f8d6988-0ebf-11e5-92b6-f7a89e3660b4.png)\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1434000987", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1433851154", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "9c7109d373f20b08e791324b04b6866590f5b092", "merged_at": "1434000987", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 9525, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "change primaryVertexCut for fast displaced Vertex reconstruction from", "updated_at": "1434000988", "user": "kropiv"}

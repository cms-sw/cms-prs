Since the latter slowed down, I'm opening another PR to at least test those latest changes.\r\n\r\nAdding a `fillDescriptions` method to `CkfTrackCandidateMaker` required more work than expected, because of the many dependencies of this plugin. Going down the rabbit hole of adding `fillDescriptions` for all the relevant classes led to touching a large number of files, both in the `c++` and `python` interfaces. The introduction of `fillDescriptions` methods in these classes exposed a number of unused parameters in PSets of various modules. In order to clean these up, customisations for the HLT configs were also necessary.\r\n\r\nMerely technical. ~~Must not change any of the outputs.~~ No changes expected.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n`addOnTests`, unit tests, and a limited set of matrix workflows passed. No detailed physics validation, only verified that the HLT decisions for a few wfs (max. 10 events each) are unchanged.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nN/A", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 72, "comments": 17, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1639211305", "deletions": 254, "labels": ["hlt-pending", "reconstruction-approved", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 36459, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "open", "title": "add `fillDescriptions` to `CkfTrackCandidateMaker` (and its dependencies)", "updated_at": "1641548222", "user": "missirol"}

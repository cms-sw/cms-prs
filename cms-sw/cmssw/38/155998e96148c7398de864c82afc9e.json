The configuration file present in `CondTools/SiPixel` at the moment doesn't allow to do that. The goal of this PR is to improve it in order to allow by LS IOVs (to be configured by means of passing arguments to `cmsRun`). \r\nI also add a couple of tests cases to the `createDBObjects` unit test.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRelies on the (augmented) unit tests (run successfully `scram b runtests_createDBObjects`) \r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nCc: @tsusa ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 4, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1692689339", "deletions": 20, "labels": ["db-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "trk"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_3_X", "number": 42622, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "improve `SiPixelBadModuleByHandBuilderFromROCList` in case of by-LS IOVs and introduce unit tests", "updated_at": "1692699779", "user": "mmusich"}

The variable `Muon::isolationR03().emEt` should no longer be the source of the issue observed, although hcal isolation can still be a cause of the inefficiency when applying the global isolation cut. A check for this is needed. \r\n\r\nNote: HLT files are slightly modified due to the introduction of new parameters, but hltmuons are not modified.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with a description of the feature proposed or problem addressed, specifying:\r\n  - what changes are expected in the output if any, \r\n  - what other PRs or externals it depends upon if any,\r\n  - link to any additional material useful to provide a documentation for this PR (slides, JIRA tickets, related pull requestes, hypernews, TWiki or Indico pages)  --> \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nEcal/Hcal isolation is compared w.r.t CMSSW_14_1_0_pre2 (before PR #44797). \r\n~1500 events of `/RelValZMM_14/CMSSW_14_1_0_pre2-140X_mcRun4_realistic_v3_STD_2026D98_noPU-v6/GEN-SIM-DIGI-RAW` have been run (no PU sample, so muon isolation should be close to 0). \r\nWeird structures in Ecal iso are fixed, while Hcal iso remains untouched.\r\n\r\nLeft: CMSSW_14_1_0_pre2 (reference)\r\nRight: this PR (target)\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://rlopezru.web.cern.ch/MuonReco/TkAlIssue/finalTest/ZMM_phi_eta_iso03emEt_nominal.png\"  width=\"360\"> <img src=\"https://rlopezru.web.cern.ch/MuonReco/TkAlIssue/finalTest/ZMM_phi_eta_iso03emEt_target_mixed_v5.png\" width=\"360\">\r\n<img src=\"https://rlopezru.web.cern.ch/MuonReco/TkAlIssue/finalTest/ZMM_phi_eta_iso03hadEt_nominal.png\"  width=\"360\"> <img src=\"https://rlopezru.web.cern.ch/MuonReco/TkAlIssue/finalTest/ZMM_phi_eta_iso03hadEt_target_mixed_v5.png\" width=\"360\">\r\n\r\nAlso, basic battery of test workflows has been run successfully.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with a description of which tests have been performed to verify the correctness of the PR, including the eventual addition of new code for testing like unit tests, test configurations, additions or updates to the runTheMatrix test workflows -->\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

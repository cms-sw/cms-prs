Comments on the function stated it was hoped\nthat the routine would never be called. To fix the thread safety problem\nand minimize the memory usage, the code was changed to use an std::atomic\npointer to cache the return value if and only if components was called.\n\nThis problem was found by the static analyzer.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1422559787", "comments": 12, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1422383076", "deletions": 13, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "2cf368d517d157a6cbb31dcc2f744096a640d63c", "merged_at": "1422559787", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 7403, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Removed use of static from components method", "updated_at": "1424891688", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

I provide here a fix to take instead the information from `DCSRecord` provided by the `OnlineMetaDataDigis` collection. \r\nI profit to add `fillDescriptions` methods and also to include header files in the same file as the plugin implementation.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nIt compiles.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nNot a backport, but might be backported for the beam test.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1634889712", "deletions": 87, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "bug-fix", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "number": 35782, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "modernize `DQM/TrackerCommon`", "updated_at": "1634902383", "user": "mmusich"}

Also adding of extra LUT tables needed by the \"combined\" modules.\r\n5) Bug fix for MatchProcessor module, so if multiple stubs are matched to a seed in a given layer, the best stub is selected.\r\n6) Significant changes to the use of stub bend in the tracklet pattern reco, so as: (a) To allow the code to cope with changes to the bend cuts used in the FE electronics (b) To allow the bend cuts within the tracklet algorithm to be specified in more bins in the tracker volume.

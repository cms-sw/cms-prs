This lead to a problem\nwhen the same EDProducer was on a Path and an EndPath. This would cause the\nEDProducer to be removed from the Path but left on the EndPath so the EDProducer\nwould remain scheduled. If modules on a Path needed the results from that\nEDProducer they would fail to get those products.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1459168172", "comments": 19, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1455898840", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["comparison-available", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 13411, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Clean EndPaths as well when going unscheduled", "updated_at": "1460030686", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

In that PR two new flavours of ALCARECO were introduced `TkAlHLTTracks` and `TkAlHLTTracksZMuMu`. \r\nI add in this PR the `hltPixelVertices` collection to the list of HLT products saved in both ALCARECO flavours.\r\nThen I profit of the existing machinery from `AlignmentTracksFromVertexSelector` in order to save also all the pixel tracks associated to the `hltPixelVertex` closest in space to the di-muon decay vertex selected by `TkAlHLTTracksZMuMu` (not necessarily the hardest in the event).\r\nIn this way it would be possible to recompute offline the vertex with different calibration constants and measure the impact of that. \r\nI profit of this PR to introduce in commit 757f9c7d3c5054ff54624ae87425fb199516f702 a small bug-fix in order to consume an intermediated collection only when it's needed. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRun successfully the following command :\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n#!/bin/bash -ex\r\n\r\ncmsDriver.py testReAlCaHLT \\\r\n\t     -s ALCA:TkAlHLTTracks+TkAlHLTTracksZMuMu  \\\r\n\t     --conditions 150X_dataRun3_HLT_v1 \\\r\n\t     --scenario pp \\\r\n\t     --data \\\r\n\t     --era Run3_2025 \\\r\n\t     --datatier ALCARECO \\\r\n\t     --eventcontent ALCARECO \\\r\n\t     --processName=ReAlCa \\\r\n\t     -n 10000 \\\r\n\t     --dasquery='file dataset=/HLTMonitor/Run2025C-Express-v2/FEVTHLTALL site=T2_CH_CERN' \\\r\n\t     --nThreads 4 >& ReAlCa.log\r\n```\r\n\r\non 10k input events:\r\n - 9900 events are selected by `ALCA:TkAlHLTTracks`.

The size of the output file `TkAlHLTTracksZMuMu.root` goes from `4.2M` to `7.9M` (i.e. a **+88%** increase -- though the event size per event remains fairly small 11kB/event).\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

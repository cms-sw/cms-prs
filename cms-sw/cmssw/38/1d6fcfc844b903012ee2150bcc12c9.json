This should improve vectorization options with compilers that don't have access to vector versions of libm.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCompiles, verified with compiler diagnostics that the loops are unrolled as intended, otherwise trivial technical change.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1652707084", "comments": 16, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1650192682", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "hold", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 37599, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 5, "state": "closed", "title": "[MkFit] use CMS_UNROLL_LOOP_COUNT and constexpr if to improve optimization", "updated_at": "1652707084", "user": "dan131riley"}

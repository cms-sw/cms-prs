So, the solution is not ideal.\r\n\r\n@cms-sw/generators-l2 \r\nIf this simple solution is not acceptable, please treat this PR as an issue and perhaps follow up with a better solution.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1683247523", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["generators-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_2_X", "number": 41548, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "restrict E-gun energy to be at least the mass value", "updated_at": "1683248151", "user": "slava77"}

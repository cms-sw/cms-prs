This is currently done using an utility in `EventFilter/Utilities`, which has been enhanced for this scope.\nFrom this information, the Physics Declared bit is computed, and added into the report summary profile.\nNOTA BENE: this is a **temporary** solution, until a well implemented unpacker for TCDS is made available in CMSSW.\n\nThe PR also resurrects a `MonitorElement` in `DQMEventInfo` showing the HLT path selection in the DQM input source `DQMStreamerReader`.\n\nThis is a back-port in 80X of #14763\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 12, "closed_at": "1493790159", "comments": 21, "commits": 10, "created_at": "1464959807", "deletions": 417, "labels": ["comparison-available", "daq-pending", "dqm-approved", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-rejected", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 14764, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Revive beam information, physics declared bit, and HLT event selection for online DQM 80X", "updated_at": "1493790159", "user": "diguida"}

The object saves a map between `DetID`s (i.e. pixel modules) and `VCal` structs. The `VCal` struct only saves two floats: slope and offset to convert VCal to #electrons.\r\n```\r\n#electrons = slope * VCal + offset\r\n```\r\nDocumentation is found in these slides:\r\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/914013/#10-gain-calibration-for-run3-p\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis code does not affect anything else inside CMSSW. It is only used for the pixel gain calibration in the independent [DPGAnalysis-SiPixelTools](https://github.com/cms-analysis/DPGAnalysis-SiPixelTools/blob/23469ffbad894b8f5154fcd7f3ac8bc7538bccca/GainCalibration/plugins/SiPixelOfflineCalibAnalysisBase.cc#L104-L112) repository.\r\n\r\nThe code compiles and works as expected, for example to create and read a `.db` file (see the above slides).", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 20, "closed_at": "1589888099", "comments": 28, "commits": 15, "created_at": "1589384701", "deletions": 50, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "db-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "f26838f48d9dbde8d4bf928c6ceadd44f4640bf9", "merged_at": "1589888099", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 29829, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 7, "state": "closed", "title": "Add SiPixelVCal DB object for pixel gain calibration", "updated_at": "1589888099", "user": "IzaakWN"}

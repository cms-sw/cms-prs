A ttbar-MC file is used (like before #41350) to exercise more triggers compared to the current input file. The new input file was made with an HLT menu which includes the fix discussed in #41045 (see also [CMSHLT-2750](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSHLT-2750)). The number of events used in this unit test is also increased without increasing significantly the duration of the test (a few seconds).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe unit test `testTriggerEventAnalyzers` passes in an ASAN IB.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

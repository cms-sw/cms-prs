However, since the code in quesiton always checked the validity of the returned edm::Handle, the exception was never used and therefore was created for no reason. This change delays creating the cms::Exception until it is absolutely needed. Profiling shows this improves performance.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 33, "closed_at": "1386319369", "comments": 13, "commits": 17, "created_at": "1386206818", "deletions": 166, "labels": ["core-approved", "fully-signed", "hlt-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-rejected", "visualization-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "abc4c4de4fe3645377f05f10dd4240616e1e727b", "merged_at": "1386319369", "merged_by": "nclopezo", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_0_0_pre10", "number": 1677, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Make failed Event::get* calls faster", "updated_at": "1386877717", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

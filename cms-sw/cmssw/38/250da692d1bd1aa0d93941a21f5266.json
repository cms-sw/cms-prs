The size of the std::vector is fixed to be equal to the number of tracking regions in IntermediateHitDoublets. Therefore, the size of the elements inside this container should be checked rather than the size of the vector itself to see if seed candidate has passed. \r\nAttaching below a plot of tracking efficiency vs pT for the 'Out of the box' tracks which demonstrates the effect of this change. In the plot, red curve is current FastSim (without this fix), blue is FastSim after this fix in place and black is FullSim. As can be seen, agreement of FastSim with FullSim will become much better after this change which indicates the proper implementation of the seed check. \r\n![trackingeffvspt](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19993232/51668760-ea94ba00-1fe8-11e9-8972-0495194f4039.png)\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1548780786", "comments": 22, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1548325453", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fastsim-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "902620ccc1094f51b01fe419f7a337421711c8f5", "merged_at": "1548780786", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_5_X", "number": 25758, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fixing the seed check in CA iterations of FastSim", "updated_at": "1548780786", "user": "angirar"}

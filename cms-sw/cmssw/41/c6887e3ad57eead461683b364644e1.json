Change in open calls could mean that there might be a missing symbol and system has to open libraries again to find it.\r\n\r\nNote that currently this unit test will fail for 14.0.X ( due to missing https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/14270 fix) but should work for 14.0.ROOT626.X IBs", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1740591527", "comments": 36, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1702977712", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "b1dfe04689f5b1da2b46ec7c1b586647345b9b51", "merged_at": "1740591527", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 43596, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "Added unit test for checking import ROOT openat calls", "updated_at": "1740591528", "user": "smuzaffar"}

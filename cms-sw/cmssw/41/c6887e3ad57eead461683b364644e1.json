Change in open calls could mean that there might be a missing symbol and system has to open libraries again to find it.\r\n\r\nNote that currently this unit test will fail for 14.0.X ( due to missing https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/14270 fix) but should work for 14.0.ROOT626.X IBs", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 23, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1702977712", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["core-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "hold", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 43596, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Added unit test for checking import ROOT openat calls", "updated_at": "1740574533", "user": "smuzaffar"}

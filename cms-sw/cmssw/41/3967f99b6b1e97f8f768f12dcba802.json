This will not affect data quality in any way since the fake clients will be deployed **only during cosmics**, when the beamspot is not really used/useful in any case.\r\n\r\nIn order not to pollute the production tags with \"fake\" BeamSpot payloads, this PR changes the name of the output tag to which the payloads are uploaded to. The tag name changes are:\r\n - `BeamSpotOnlineLegacy` --> `BeamSpotOnlineFakeLegacy`\r\n - `BeamSpotOnlineHLT` --> `BeamSpotOnlineFakeHLT`\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nCode compiles\r\n\r\n#### Backport:\r\nNot a backport, but backports to 12_3 and 12_2 will be soon raised.\r\n\r\nFYI: @gennai @ggovi @mzarucki @Sam-Harper ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1648461764", "deletions": 8, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 37376, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Fix tag names in DQM Fake BeamSpot clients", "updated_at": "1648462267", "user": "francescobrivio"}

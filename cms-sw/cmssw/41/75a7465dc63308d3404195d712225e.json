The difference wrt the previous tag is summarized [here](https://github.com/cms-l1-dpg/L1MenuRun3/tree/master/development/L1Menu_Collisions2024_v1_3_0) , and the new or removed seeds can be visible also via the Payload Inspector:\r\n![L1TDiff](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/assets/4069749/570abe57-e767-4be9-89f4-5cafe7d2668b)\r\n\r\nThe updated 2024 MC GTs in autoCond are the following:\r\n- [140X_mcRun3_2024_realistic_v15](https://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/list/Prod/gts/140X_mcRun3_2024_realistic_v15)\r\n- [140X_mcRun3_2024_design_v11](https://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/list/Prod/gts/140X_mcRun3_2024_design_v11)\r\n- [140X_mcRun3_2024cosmics_realistic_deco_v13](https://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/list/Prod/gts/140X_mcRun3_2024cosmics_realistic_deco_v13)\r\n- [140X_mcRun3_2024cosmics_design_deco_v11](https://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/list/Prod/gts/140X_mcRun3_2024cosmics_design_deco_v11)\r\n\r\nAnd the difference wrt the GTs previously in autocond are the following:\r\n- https://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/140X_mcRun3_2024_realistic_v14/140X_mcRun3_2024_realistic_v15\r\n- https://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/140X_mcRun3_2024_design_v10/140X_mcRun3_2024_design_v11\r\n- https://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/140X_mcRun3_2024cosmics_realistic_deco_v12/140X_mcRun3_2024cosmics_realistic_deco_v13\r\n- https://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/140X_mcRun3_2024cosmics_design_deco_v10/140X_mcRun3_2024cosmics_design_deco_v11\r\n\r\nPlease notice that the new `phase1_2024_realistic` GT includes also three additional updates that were not yet propagated to autocond, and therefore pile-up here on top of the L1T menu change:\r\n- 140X_mcRun3_2024_realistic_v12:\r\n   - Update GEM Channel mapping for 2024 MC conditions.

That's the default case. \r\n\r\n* When `isRun3` is set to True, `getStrip(uint16_t n)` returns the 1/2-, 1/4-, or 1/8-strip position for n=2, n=4, or n=8. `getRun3Pattern()` returns the Run-3 pattern number. `getPattern()` returns the most compatible Run-2 pattern (for debugging purposes mainly). `getSlope()` returns the 4-bit bending value. The 1-bit bending `getBend()` (0: negative, 1: positive in delta strip / layer) and the 4-bit slope `getSlope()` combines into the 5-bit bending of the LCT.\r\n\r\nI would like to have this in before CMSSW_11_2_0 is closed.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles. Tested with ```runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos```\r\n\r\nBecause the CCLUT algorithm is not switched on yet, there should be no differences in the comparisons with the baseline. \r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n@tahuang1991 ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1607447996", "comments": 18, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1606845576", "deletions": 7, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "f6922e6ed7083771121fcacca23fe00ca3460074", "merged_at": "1607447996", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 32360, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Set Run-3 CCLUT algo results in LCT (CCLUT-10) ", "updated_at": "1607447996", "user": "dildick"}

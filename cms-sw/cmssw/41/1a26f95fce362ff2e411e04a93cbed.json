There is a possibility to make code faster and be more clean but any such change requires editions in many files. This is a first clean-up, which includes:\r\n  1) use of const pointers and references were possible\r\n  2) removal of all protected members from the base class\r\n  3) implement common intialisation in the base class\r\n  4) substitute remaining auto_ptr by std::unique_ptr\r\nNo change of algorithms, so expected unchanged results.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 82, "closed_at": "1512647426", "comments": 44, "commits": 9, "created_at": "1511985574", "deletions": 1387, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "8ded5ce29f327987f21dceca6c1fc58d544bea88", "merged_at": "1512647426", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_0_X", "number": 21489, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Geant4 sensitive detectors cleanup 1", "updated_at": "1512647426", "user": "civanch"}

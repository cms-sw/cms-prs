It was checked that all newly added dependencies are actually required by the package with `git grep`.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 10, "closed_at": "1602858573", "comments": 15, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1601993313", "deletions": 13, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "22f6b9d080766a2d64bfb71973096ba1262a2f7e", "merged_at": "1602858573", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 31685, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Clean more BuildFiles in DataFormats", "updated_at": "1603198308", "user": "guitargeek"}

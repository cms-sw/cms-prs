This adds no functionality at all, just expands out all function calls of the `customiseRun2EraExtras` customisation to individual commands (probably should have put this in with the first PR).  There is a description of what this function is for on #7419.\n\nThe advantage of this PR is to make the next pull requests easier to assess, since each one will have something added to the era and the corresponding line taken out of this function.  It also serves as a \"check list\" of every command that still needs to be added to the era.\nI've done diffs of the `edmConfigDump`s for all 1320.0 steps before and after and absolutely nothing changes.\n\nThere's not much point running any tests, none of the tests use the affected function.  I did run 1320.0 however with `--customise SLHCUpgradeSimulations/Configuration/postLS1Customs.customisePostLS1` replaced with `--era run2 --customise SLHCUpgradeSimulations/Configuration/postLS1Customs.customiseRun2EraExtras` to make sure I didn't make a stupid formatting mistake.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1422613902", "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1422544992", "deletions": 18, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "0b6e7a3faafa7ac997a52a7d3bf594c4f1824b5f", "merged_at": "1422613902", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 7456, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Implement postLS1 as an Era - tranche 1", "updated_at": "1423154159", "user": "mark-grimes"}

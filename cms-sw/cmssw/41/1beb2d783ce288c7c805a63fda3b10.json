From a brief [discussion](https://mattermost.web.cern.ch/cms-exp/pl/s4shbyac8jd8ujeoq4e5yfsykr), it sounds like this is only in specialized workflows, probably not captured by anything in the bot tests.\r\n\r\n@cms-sw/trk-dpg-l2 @cms-sw/tracking-pog-l2 ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1736807313", "deletions": 38, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending", "trk"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_0_X", "number": 47094, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "fill charge_ and barycenter_ for all SiStripClusters", "updated_at": "1736807339", "user": "slava77"}

This is take 2 of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/19548, which pulled in some unwanted commits somehow.\r\n\r\nEdit: at @dmitrijus' request, here is the comment from the original PR. \r\n\r\n- Finish protecting against inclusion of calibration channels in QIE10/11DigiCollections. These can cause crashes when FEDs 1134 and 1135 are included in runs. (The previous PRs fixed most of these, but I unfortunately discovered a few more cases.)\r\n- Add zero suppression to emulated TPs, to match what is done in data TPs.\r\n- PedestalTask has a filter to skip the laser/CRF/calibration channels crate. This was moved from crate 36 to 38, so the filter is updated accordingly (note that crate 36 is not in use anymore).\r\n- Small plot adjustments: fN_to4000 changed to fN_to8000 (this is used only to set the y-range for profile plots, so doesn't add bins), and fEtCorr_256 is changed from [-2,256] to [-1, 257] so that saturated bins aren't right on the edge.\r\nThis PR does not add any extra bins.\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_9_2_X", "changed_files": 39, "closed_at": "1513937678", "comments": 17, "commits": 76, "created_at": "1499261533", "deletions": 745, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_9_2_X", "number": 19569, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "HCALDQM: more fixes for crashes due to calib channels, improve TP emulation, and minor plot adjustments (92X backport of 19547)", "updated_at": "1513937679", "user": "DryRun"}

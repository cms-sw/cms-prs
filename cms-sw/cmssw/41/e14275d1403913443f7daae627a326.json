In the past, we have manually changed the cuts (well via scripts) to fully relax the endcap cuts. Every year we have partially messed this up (some triggers slip through the cracks etc). So this year, we're controlling this with a central bool which can be easily toggled. When toggled, it zeros (or sets it to an other appropriate variable) all track matching cuts in the endcap.  Right now it does it for all produced values including E/p which is probably not strickly necessary but this is on the safe side. \r\n\r\nhltEgammaGsfTrackVars.useDefaultValuesForEndcap = cms.bool(True) and all E/gamma track cuts will automatically pass for endcap electrons. \r\n\r\n@Martin-Grunewald ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1520595229", "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1520501873", "deletions": 12, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "hlt-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "2146f4009b2c949b4419d777b1a8cc3b777f35ab", "merged_at": "1520595229", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_1_X", "number": 22525, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Allowing Easy Disabling/Enabling of E/gamma HLT track matching cuts", "updated_at": "1520595229", "user": "Sam-Harper"}

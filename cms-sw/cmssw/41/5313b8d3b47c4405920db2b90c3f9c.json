Several POGs still use calotowers, specially at HLT. So, to ensure that correct HCAL thresholds are used in making calotowers,  the safest way is to use the thresholds from GT.\r\nThat is what is done in this PR. Related github issue: https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/43312 \r\n\r\nThis is a technical PR. In principle there should not be any change in physics. But I expect there will be some changes. \r\n\r\nFor Phase2 HLT, there might be some changes seen in PR tests, because the thresholds from DB and thresholds written here would not match:\r\nhttps://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/40d9d46f15f482f8fa72892ffc76f5bce8d618ce/HLTrigger/Configuration/python/HLT_75e33/modules/caloTowerForTrk_cfi.py#L23-L25\r\nhttps://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/40d9d46f15f482f8fa72892ffc76f5bce8d618ce/HLTrigger/Configuration/python/HLT_75e33/modules/towerMaker_cfi.py#L23-L25\r\n\r\nIn offline reco also, some changes can be seen in barrel for Run3, because the correct thresholds present in DB and thresholds written here does not seem to match:\r\nhttps://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/e9b40ab5975f05832f3e6a9fcaffa1cbd3315fbb/RecoLocalCalo/CaloTowersCreator/python/calotowermaker_cfi.py#L173-L176\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nChecked with `12434.0_TTbar_14TeV+2023`\r\n\r\nFYI @missirol  @cms-sw/hlt-l2  @cms-sw/alca-l2 @cms-sw/hcal-dpg-l2 ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 10, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1700401765", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "requires-external", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "number": 43329, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Migrate calotower code to use HCAL thresholds from GT", "updated_at": "1701444088", "user": "swagata87"}

The index for the for loop does not match the if/else statements, hence causing an empty GEM/RPC TP to be created which then causes the crash when we try to create detID.\r\n\r\nThis should be backported to 12_4_X and 12_5_X to fix the same ug in those releases. \r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with a description of the feature proposed or problem addressed, specifying:\r\n  - what changes are expected in the output if any, \r\n  - what other PRs or externals it depends upon if any,\r\n  - link to any additional material useful to provide a documentation for this PR (slides, JIRA tickets, related pull requestes, hypernews, TWiki or Indico pages)  -->\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested with running the unpacker on the data files mentioned in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/39456. Unpacker runs and assigns the correct values to GEM/RPC TPs.\r\n\r\nFile used: `/eos/cms/store/t0streamer/Data/Express/000/359/045/run359045_ls0144_streamExpress_StorageManager.dat`\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1663699426", "comments": 10, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1663692313", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["l1-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "bug-fix", "orp-approved", "urgent", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "dee7c06bc7d2ab8d7618483178896cd5f9398e9c", "merged_at": "1663699426", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_6_X", "number": 39460, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Bug fix in EMTF GEM and RPC unpacker blocks", "updated_at": "1663706937", "user": "eyigitba"}

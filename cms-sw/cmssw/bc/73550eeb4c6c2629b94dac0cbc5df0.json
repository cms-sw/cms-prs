It should not affect anyone who uses official samples, and it should not affect any validation plots because the default in [trackingTruthProducer_cfi.py](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/CMSSW_6_2_SLHCDEV_X/SimGeneral/MixingModule/python/trackingTruthProducer_cfi.py) has\n\n```\n    ignoreTracksOutsideVolume = cms.bool(False)\n```\n\nWhen the switch is false, the check of vertex position is not done. It only matters when a person decides to switch it on to get **only** the tracking particles and tracking vertices **inside the tracker**, as specified by the parameters\n\n```\n    volumeRadius = cms.double(120.0),\n    volumeZ = cms.double(300.0),\n```\n\nHowever, as it is, the cut on vertex z is applied as a single-sided cut, rather than as a double-sided cut. I believe the expected behavior should be the latter, but I guess it's really up to the experts to decide.\n\nThis was first discussed on the pull request #9680 . As suggested by @mark-grimes, this is a duplicated pull request, but instead for the CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC release.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1434714708", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1434712801", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "8009934e7579a42cc071f371335670675d9b77a9", "merged_at": "1434714708", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "number": 9681, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Update TrackingParticleFactory::vectorIsInsideVolume(...) function in TrackingTruthAccumulator", "updated_at": "1470843614", "user": "jiafulow"}

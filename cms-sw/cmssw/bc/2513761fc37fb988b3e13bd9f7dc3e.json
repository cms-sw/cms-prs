I believe it is bit of an overkill, and probably just a historic remnant (AFAICT has been there always in 81X).\n\nFYI @boudoul @kpedro88 \n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1468385745", "comments": 10, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1466579773", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "pdmv-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "3da5ba8bff599b65d1e777d83851627db30d51f4", "merged_at": "1468385745", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 14944, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Switch upgrade RecoFull event content to RECOSIM", "updated_at": "1468385746", "user": "makortel"}

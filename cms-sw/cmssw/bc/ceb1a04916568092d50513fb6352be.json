Given the current lack of person-power in that area I do not see how it can ever happen.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_2_X", "changed_files": 30, "closed_at": "1407856483", "comments": 23, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1407651015", "deletions": 84, "labels": ["alca-pending", "comparison-available", "fastsim-pending", "geometry-approved", "hlt-approved", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "81e43e820bacbd1f27614ac5bc644dc17e7a0b09", "merged_at": "1407856483", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_2_X", "number": 4919, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "Clear tk geom", "updated_at": "1492768341", "user": "VinInn"}

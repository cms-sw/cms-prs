The change consists of a setting of a parameter in two python filles. \r\n\r\nSince the cluster statistics affects the precision of the gain payload, it is important to have this PR merged in the main branch and to have it delivered at Tier0 asap. indeed it impacts the gain computation in  the MRH framework. The framework that uses the calibration ntuple is not affected by this one, because - in this case - the input statistic is handled manually.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the statistic fix, the fill of some monitoring histogram has been protected against the inclusion of statistics from the Pixel detector. This change concerns the inclusion of an if statement into two .cc files.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1498213338", "comments": 32, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1498058081", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["alca-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "768d6404763483eafb53b8eb26f4a4f4dac82da3", "merged_at": "1498213338", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_2_X", "number": 19400, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "Fixing the statistics for MultiRunHarvesting", "updated_at": "1498213338", "user": "dimattia"}

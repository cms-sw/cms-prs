The DQM beamspot client (a new version as well) would just fit the vertices, without any other reconstruction. These paths and streams are needed at HLT but can run only when it is safe to enable track reconstruction, i.e. never at the start up of a new data taking year. When this stream cannot be enabled, we need to change the DQM beamspot client enabling the old one (which was making use of the DQM stream, always present in any menu) and make sure that the proper output file is used (the name is different for the two different clients). DQM and WBM experts should be alerted! \r\n\r\nThis temporarily enables the old client and makes it a default one.", "branch": "CMSSW_10_1_X", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1523687480", "deletions": 8, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "dqm-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_1_X", "number": 22966, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Temporarily disable the HLT beamspot client", "updated_at": "1523687518", "user": "dmitrijus"}

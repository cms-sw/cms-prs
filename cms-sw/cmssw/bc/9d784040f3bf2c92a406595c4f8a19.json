We have introduced a new EcalMonitorTask called GpuTask designed to take in CPU and GPU generated objects and produce plots comparing several object quantities for each run. Objects include ECAL Digis, Uncalibrared RecHits, and RecHits.\r\n\r\nThis task will not run by default on the regular Online DQM workflow.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nModule was run with the runTheMatrix workflow 10842.512 and Digi and Uncalib RecHit plots look as expected. GPU RecHit plots showed up empty, which was expected due to GPU RecHits currently being disabled in CMSSW. To test functionality with large amounts of data, the module was run on some 2018 data (only CPU objects available) and plots look as expected.\r\n\r\n[GPU-enabled collections]: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pCbC-PU2LJMpWK9JxYrRIjpKXMH_QG47py5joFImiAQ/edit#slide=id.gf6f43175a4_0_11", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 10, "closed_at": "1645521106", "comments": 43, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1642536083", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["dqm-approved", "operations-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "3bd69e8a59fd6ba94b52d3cbb97b8cbcaba7d5dc", "merged_at": "1645521106", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 36742, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 14, "state": "closed", "title": "Create new ECAL DQM GpuTask to monitor and compare CPU and GPU generated ECAL RECO objects", "updated_at": "1645521106", "user": "alejands"}

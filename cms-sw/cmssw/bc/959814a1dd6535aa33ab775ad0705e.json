The Run2_2018 GT is used for now. Because HCAL conditions don't exist yet for the post-LS2 geometry, the hardcode conditions are used (via the new modifier setup introduced in #19712).\r\n\r\nA few modifications are made to the GEM geometry based on phase2 developments (discussed with experts). In addition, I had to fix some logic in a muon DQM analyzer to prevent a crash; with GE1/1 included, we apparently get some muons that fail all the conditions `isGlobalMuon()`, `isTrackerMuon()`, `isRPCMuon()`, `isStandAloneMuon()`. For now, those muons are just skipped. Muon experts may want to improve this handling in the future.\r\n\r\nattn: @calabria, @bsunanda, @ianna ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 21, "closed_at": "1502255181", "comments": 25, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1500916577", "deletions": 42, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "geometry-approved", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-approved", "pending-signatures", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "0dee4e3ff42e6f3bede96916511cf31e538a03fe", "merged_at": "1502255181", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_3_X", "number": 19889, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 5, "state": "closed", "title": "Introduce Run3 (post-LS2) workflow", "updated_at": "1503310317", "user": "kpedro88"}

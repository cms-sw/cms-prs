It produces value maps based on the usual reco-to-sim and sim-to-reco matching already used for validation.\r\n- The produced value map and auxiliary features are then fed to the PixelTracks flat table as external variables. This is just an example use case, the aforementioned module can be used for generic reco::Track collections.\r\n- A new flat table is added for per-track rec-hit features (up to a fixed maximum number of hits)\r\n\r\nAll these features are used in a newly added NanoAOD worfklow: `NANO:@Phase2HLTPixelOnly` which produces PixelTracks + RecHits ntuples with MC truth label, intended for Phase-2 HLT development.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThere is no change to existing workflows of physics-related code. The pixel-track NanoAOD tables produce the expected per-track truth labels and hit-level information in local tests.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1767544519", "comments": 18, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1765532017", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["hlt-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved", "xpog-approved", "ngt"], "merge_commit_sha": "778172d73653798c410e907bfeee9970becbb6a6", "merged_at": "1767544519", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_16_1_X", "number": 49617, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "[NGT] Add MC truth labels support to NanoAOD `reco::Track`s and introduce PixelTracks+RecHits ntuples", "updated_at": "1767544521", "user": "Parsifal-2045"}

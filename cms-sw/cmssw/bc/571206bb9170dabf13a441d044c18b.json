This pixel-level accumulation is consistent with the digitization [1].\r\n\r\nContrary to this, in the validation, the accumulation is currently performed solely based on modules (DetId), as in the BTL. \r\nWhile this may not significantly impact processes without pile-up due to the relatively low occupancy, it becomes a critical concern under high pile-up conditions.\r\n\r\nIn order to consistently test changes in the ETL digitization [2] it is crucial to rectify this discrepancy. \r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/SimFastTiming/FastTimingCommon/src/ETLDeviceSim.cc#L78\r\n[2] https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/43762", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 13, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1707475893", "deletions": 43, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-rejected", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "mtd"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_2_X", "number": 43928, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "open", "title": "Correction of MTD ETL Validation: hits accumulation on a pixel-basis", "updated_at": "1725349293", "user": "ctarricone"}

On the other hand, the `L1CaloGeometry` object is not really needed for configuration/template parameters in use in the Run-3 HLT menu (basically, the `L1CaloGeometry` object is needed when the HLT modules need to use the `l1extra` objects from the Stage-1 L1T, and that is never the case in HLT menus for Run 3).\r\n\r\nThis update should facilitate the removal of the relevant record from the Run-3 HLT GT (see https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/36806 and related issues/PRs).\r\n\r\n[ The change in `autoCond` is temporary, and will be removed before integration (I tested wf `139.004` locally w/o the tag `L1CaloGeometry_CRAFT09_hlt`, but this should be tested centrally, and I don't know a better way to do that). ]\r\n\r\nMerely technical. No changes expected.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n`runTheMatrix -l 139.004`, `addOnTests.py`, and verified that all trigger-objects are unchanged for 100 MC events processed with the HLT GRun menu.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nN/A", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1645129026", "comments": 16, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1645028989", "deletions": 52, "labels": ["hlt-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "26587877e8da5f4098ff5851db7ff2b7422a627e", "merged_at": "1645129026", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 36986, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "update of HLT-E/Gamma modules to avoid accessing `L1CaloGeometry` unnecessarily", "updated_at": "1645129027", "user": "missirol"}

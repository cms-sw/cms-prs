The changes include:\n1) Removing one unused and one unnecessary data member.\n2) Renaming some data members, function members, and function parameters to be more mnemonic\n3) The three data members that are never changed are made const (more for clarity than for const correctness) and initialized in the initializer lists of the class. They are no longer modified in init() (renamed to initPathNames()), because they were just being reset to the same values.\n4) The three const data members are the first three data members.\n5) Iterator loops are changed to range for loops.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1441428969", "comments": 17, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1441383871", "deletions": 305, "labels": ["comparison-available", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "335a5c368c2afbb8467b8fe45c3e664b3bf7ed2e", "merged_at": "1441428969", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 11143, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "Maintainability cleanup for EventSelector", "updated_at": "1442242338", "user": "wmtan"}

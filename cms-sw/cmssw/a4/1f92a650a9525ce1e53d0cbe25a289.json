Investigation showed only ME1/2 LCTs (oddly enough) with invalid pattern numbers. This was fixed with https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/commit/9354dff643d672ed1d864559d757a53082355968. \r\n\r\nFurther investigation revealed that the CLCT processor readout function was not checking if CLCTs were valid, and that GEM-CSC motherboards do not check if incoming pads are valid. The code was also missing quality control. I added a number of `checkValid` functions that check the properties for ALCT/CLCT/LCT at various stages of the algorithm. LogErrors are printed in case values go out of bounds.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested on 10k events of \r\n- `/RelValSingleMuFlatPt2To100/CMSSW_11_0_0-PU25ns_110X_mcRun4_realistic_v3_2026D49PU200-v1/GEN-SIM-DIGI-RAW`\r\n- `/RelValSingleMuFlatPt2To100/CMSSW_11_0_0-110X_mcRun4_realistic_v2_2026D49noPU-v1/GEN-SIM-DIGI-RAW`\r\nI did not see LogErrors of invalid stubs.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nBackport of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/30909.", "branch": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "changed_files": 18, "closed_at": "1596214413", "comments": 39, "commits": 14, "created_at": "1595676941", "deletions": 179, "labels": ["backport", "comparison-available", "l1-pending", "orp-approved", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-approved", "urgent"], "merge_commit_sha": "7ad2e58bb4734b70f163da2116f42e0476697c87", "merged_at": "1596214413", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 30914, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 5, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix broken LCTs reported in HLT_L1SingleMu25 [11_1_X]", "updated_at": "1596214413", "user": "dildick"}

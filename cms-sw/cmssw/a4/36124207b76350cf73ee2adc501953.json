In order to remove this last vestige of boost::shared_ptr,\nusers of EventSetup need to be converted to std::shared_ptr. This PR does this for geometry, alignment, and visualization packages. Also, std::make_shared is implemented where it makes sense, because it simplifies the code and saves a memory allocation. The changes to geometry and alignment were not independent, so they are being done in a single PR.\nThis PR is totally technical.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 97, "closed_at": "1459784986", "comments": 6, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1459603654", "deletions": 208, "labels": ["alca-pending", "comparison-available", "geometry-approved", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "visualization-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "40cddb87ca419b41f50b83c32fe1d6712e7cf2e6", "merged_at": "1459784986", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 13897, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "use std::shared_ptr and std::make_shared (EventSetup in Geometry/Alignment/Visualization)", "updated_at": "1464230142", "user": "wmtan"}

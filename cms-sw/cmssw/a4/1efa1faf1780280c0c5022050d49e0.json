It removes bad pf candidates clustered to jets by adding new modules for fix EE in MET tool. It adds the fixEE2017 and fixEE2017Params parameters to MET tool.\r\n\r\nThis recipe creates a new pfcandidates collection which does not include the lower pt jets in the high-eta endcap region which are mostly affected by EE noise. It removes all jets and associated PF candidates with pt<50 GeV and 2.65 <|eta| < 3.139 before calculating MET.\r\n\r\nMore details of the recipe can be found here: https://indico.cern.ch/event/759372/contributions/3149378/attachments/1721436/2802416/metreport.pdf\r\n\r\ncc: @peruzzim", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 31, "commits": 25, "created_at": "1539610978", "deletions": 10, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_4_X", "number": 24876, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 5, "state": "open", "title": "MET EE noise mitigation in 2017 data", "updated_at": "1540293017", "user": "eioannou"}

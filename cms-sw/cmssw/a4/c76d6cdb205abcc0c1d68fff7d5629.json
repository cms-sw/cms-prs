The electrons which end up in this category were previously in the \"showering class\". \nThe plots below have been made with RelValZEE 710pre3 samples.\nThe migration from one class to the other can be seen here:\n![h_ele_classes](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/4553043/2421583/bb597660-ab83-11e3-9cf3-117ee1c8fdd6.gif)\n(red is new, blue is default 710pre3; the entries <10 are in the barrel; >=10 in the endcaps)\n\nEven though the regression is using the class and was trained before the fix, it seems that it won't be necessary to retrain it. \n![h_ele_poptrue_showering_barrel](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/4553043/2421607/25bbff6e-ab84-11e3-9b5f-e7bfc004932d.gif)\n![h_ele_poptrue_showering_endcaps](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/4553043/2421608/25bf4106-ab84-11e3-81c9-904d5b30ad93.gif)\nThe resolution is actually slightly improved. The statistics have decreased between the two cases, which is normal. \n\nThere are no validation plots for the \"badTrack\" class, but the inclusive plots is essentially unchanged.\n![h_ele_poptrue](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/4553043/2421621/53dcbc9e-ab84-11e3-981c-b0aff2a015e1.gif)\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1395042182", "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1394803498", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "81c4015de8dff1700a88af488b8bca0b5afcccc8", "merged_at": "1395042182", "merged_by": "nclopezo", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_1_0_pre5", "number": 2872, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 4, "state": "closed", "title": "restore class definition using PF information", "updated_at": "1500637512", "user": "beaudett"}

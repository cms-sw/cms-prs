This code resides in a new package DataFormats/TCDS. It replaces the FED1024 class which exposes direct access to the underlying data structure, and incorporates the separate BSTRecord. I also changed the code using the old accessors to the new ones, as far as I could find them. In addition, the EventAuxiliary is now filled with the current fill (store) number instead of 'edm::EventAuxiliary::invalidStoreNumber'.\r\n\r\nThis PR replaces #20387.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 58, "closed_at": "1506438322", "comments": 52, "commits": 18, "created_at": "1505203114", "deletions": 548, "labels": ["alca-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "core-pending", "daq-approved", "dqm-pending", "hlt-pending", "l1-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "d21e27af070224309b0686f6f764a9e9143885dc", "merged_at": "1506438322", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_4_X", "number": 20471, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "Persist TCDS FED payload", "updated_at": "1506491733", "user": "mommsen"}

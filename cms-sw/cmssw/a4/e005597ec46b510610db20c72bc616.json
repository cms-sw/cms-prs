This pull request addresses this by enlarging the lumisection scale to 3000 for the \"rpstate per LS\" plot within the CTPPS (PPS) DQM.\r\n\r\nPreviously, an attempt was made in #48201 to use `hist->SetCanExtend(TH2F::kXaxis);` to allow for an automatically extending X-axis when more than 1000 LS were recorded. However, this approach **did not work as expected**, and the X-axis remained limited to a fixed range.\r\n\r\nThis PR implements a direct increase of the X-axis range to 3000 LS, ensuring that lumisections in longer runs are properly displayed and monitored. While this is a hardcoded solution, it's crucial for us to avoid the current 1000 LS limitation. We are open to alternative solutions that offer a more dynamic or automatic axis extension in the future.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nPrivate DQM production.

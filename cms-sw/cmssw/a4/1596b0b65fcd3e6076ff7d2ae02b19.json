Effectively, it incorporates the customisation [`customizeHLTforPatatrackTriplets`](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/CMSSW_12_3_2/HLTrigger/Configuration/python/customizeHLTforPatatrack.py#L844) into the HLT menus maintained by TSG. This also coincides with the introduction of \"Tasks\" in the offline HLT menus. Following the discussion in #36938, it is expected that in the near future `cms.Task` will be replaced by `cms.ConditionalTask` in HLT configs (likely in `12_4_X`).\r\n\r\nThis PR also includes small changes to the TSG tests to ensure that those tests continue to work even when they are executed on a machine with a GPU.\r\n\r\n  - A customisation to HLT+RECO tests is added to remove GPU EventSetup modules from Tasks that are not included in the Schedule; this is needed to make said ES modules available to HLT producers when the test runs on a GPU machine. More details can be found [here (CMSHLT-2288)](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSHLT-2288?focusedCommentId=4326483&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-4326483).\r\n\r\n  - The HLT-integration tests are forced, for now, to run on CPU even if the machine has a GPU. This avoids tests failing due to the current limits in reproducibility of HLT outputs when using GPUs.\r\n\r\nBoth changes are workarounds in a way, and they could/should be improved in the future.\r\n\r\nA small fix in `customizeHLTforPatatrack.py` is also included.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTSG tests.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\n#37783\r\n\r\nDevelopment of HLT menus for Run-3 startup.", "branch": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "changed_files": 14, "closed_at": "1651749064", "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1651637544", "deletions": 1438, "labels": ["hlt-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "backport-ok"], "merge_commit_sha": "46ebf50d1a9905ad16c2c4f84ccd81acf7dc0904", "merged_at": "1651749064", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 37793, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "HLT menu development for `12_3_X` (Patatrack GPU modules)", "updated_at": "1651749064", "user": "missirol"}

It also adds plots for these data to the uGMT DQM.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nI ran `runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos` and `scram b runtests` without errors. I also checked that the plots in the DQM appeared as expected.\r\n\r\n@eyigitba please check if this makes sense to you too. I think you may need to update the EMTF (un)packers accordingly if this hasn't been done already.\r\nattn @rekovic, please let me know if you'd like me to backport this.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 17, "closed_at": "1616011192", "comments": 20, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1615461176", "deletions": 74, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "dbeb22f8c58d074efa6df1d8a4a4be39e10ba73b", "merged_at": "1616011192", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 33146, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add displaced muon info from EMTF to RegionalMuonCand (un)packing and to uGMT DQM", "updated_at": "1616011192", "user": "dinyar"}

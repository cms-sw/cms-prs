This is not used by Type-I/II/0 corrections)\nhttps://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/CMSSW_7_1_0_pre6/DataFormats/METReco/interface/MET.h#L76\n\nThis PR request will prepare for these deletion. \n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1397478201", "comments": 5, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1397243251", "deletions": 117, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "a11bd4a2de1dc1cd27c9d58720fb3f93938a3c8f", "merged_at": "1397478201", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_1_0_pre7", "number": 3314, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "code-cleaning in RecoMET", "updated_at": "1405497138", "user": "TaiSakuma"}

Specifically, these were coming from the EcalIntegrityMemBlockSizeErrors collection and occurred for a number of events in runs 338624 and 338628. At least in run 338628, this was always occurring with the same unphysical coordinates:\r\n\r\nMemBlockSizeError:\r\ndccId: 24\r\ntowerId: 70\r\n\r\nIt turns out that towerIDs 69 and 70 correspond to the MEM boxes for most ECAL SMs. These MEM boxes also have a front-end (FE) status that was not being displayed, due to the code assuming these coordinates are unphysical.\r\n\r\nIntegrity errors for towerID 69 had been masked before not knowing that these towerIDs do have a meaning: https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/commit/95eed04a96ac618a285c8388001c3542a3f0445f\r\n\r\nIn this PR we now handle the two additional tower IDs and plots the FE status and integrity errors for these MEM boxes. The plots contain two bins for each SM corresponding to tower IDs 69 and 70, respectively. The plots are indexed by ECAL DCC ID, where each DCC ID corresponds to a SM. The mapping from DCC ID to SM name appears below.\r\n```\r\n01:EE-07  19:EB-10  37:EB+10\r\n02:EE-08  20:EB-11  38:EB+11\r\n03:EE-09  21:EB-12  39:EB+12\r\n04:EE-01  22:EB-13  40:EB+13\r\n05:EE-02  23:EB-14  41:EB+14\r\n06:EE-03  24:EB-15  42:EB+15\r\n07:EE-04  25:EB-16  43:EB+16\r\n08:EE-05  26:EB-17  44:EB+17\r\n09:EE-06  27:EB-18  45:EB+18\r\n10:EB-01  28:EB+01  46:EE+07\r\n11:EB-02  29:EB+02  47:EE+08\r\n12:EB-03  30:EB+03  48:EE+09\r\n13:EB-04  31:EB+04  49:EE+01\r\n14:EB-05  32:EB+05  50:EE+02\r\n15:EB-06  33:EB+06  51:EE+03\r\n16:EB-07  34:EB+07  52:EE+04\r\n17:EB-08  35:EB+08  53:EE+05\r\n18:EB-09  36:EB+09  54:EE+06\r\n```\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nNew plots successfully generated with online ECAL DQM workflow and uploaded to a private DQM GUI without any issues.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nThis is a backport of the original PR here: https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/32443\r\n\r\nThis is done to ensure the changes are available in CMSSW_11_2_X, which would be used in the next MWGR in February 2021.", "branch": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1608106018", "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1607962309", "deletions": 21, "labels": ["backport", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "d57bc7273e466a6ec9923a0fed7fcb7bd9427d24", "merged_at": "1608106018", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 32481, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "[DQM/EcalMonitorTasks] Add MEM FE Status and Integrity Error Plots", "updated_at": "1608106018", "user": "alejands"}

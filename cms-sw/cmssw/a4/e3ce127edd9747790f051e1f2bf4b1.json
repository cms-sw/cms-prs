I changed \"scal lumi/PU\" to a more generic \"online lumi/PU\", but of course feel free to suggest better names.\r\n\r\nMinor technical improvements (e.g. `const`-ness of class data members) were done in the process.\r\n\r\n375912fd9d612c923d8e79af4d8570ee9079eda3 fixes a couple of pixel-related harvesting outputs which depend on the outputs of the `LumiMonitor` plugin; please see https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/39859#issuecomment-1296284482 for details.\r\n\r\n(In case this is backported to `12_4_X`, it should not warrant a new `ConfDB` parsing, since the new configuration parameter of `LumiMonitor`, i.e. `onlineMetaDataDigis`, already defaults to the intended collection; at the same time, `hltOnlineMetaDataDigis` should in principle be included in the `DQMHistograms` EndPath in the HLT menus.)\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nA local test confirms that the plots in question (profile vs PU, vs lumi) now have entries (see ![attachment](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5320055/198058173-6ebeab63-fe76-4077-884e-18644b8aa311.png)).\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

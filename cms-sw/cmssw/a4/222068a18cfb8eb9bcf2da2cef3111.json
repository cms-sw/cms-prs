Also changed (the value of the deviation from the expected timing above which bad quality is triggered) to 1.0.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1491030527", "comments": 20, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1490349986", "deletions": 8, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "e502e8204f34d5290dbac746ea5d336e1c1a0810", "merged_at": "1491030526", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_1_X", "number": 18067, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 4, "state": "closed", "title": "Adding Timing vs BX plots, and modifying thresholds for laser quality", "updated_at": "1493288942", "user": "tanmaymudholkar"}

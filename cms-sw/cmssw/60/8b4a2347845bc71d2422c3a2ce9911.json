Therefore these changes are nominally on top of #40670.\r\n\r\nFor completeness, we also add the intermediate inputs that are used to produce these new seeded cone jet collection i.e. the puppi candidates produced using the \"extended tracks\", as is done for the existing seeded cone jet collection (those produced using the regular tracks).\r\n\r\nThe corresponding PR to the L1T integration branch is [here](https://github.com/cms-l1t-offline/cmssw/pull/1090).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRan standard cmsDriver command from runTheMatrix.  By itself, this PR doesn't change anything.  On top of #40670, I see the new objects are present in the output root file.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1680691763", "comments": 14, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1680518636", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["l1-approved", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "hold", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_1_X", "number": 41258, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add missing L1 jet collection to event (Phase 2)", "updated_at": "1680691764", "user": "EmyrClement"}

This was caused by a pointer being assigned in the init function, not the constructor. This was why the class was inspected. The following changes were made\r\n- all owning pointers were changed to std::unique_ptr\r\n- parameters are not read and assigned in the constructor instead of `init`\r\n- immutable member data are now declared `const`\r\n- unused/unnecessary member variables were removed\r\n- theResetMethod was changed from a `std::string` to an enum.\r\n\r\nThe latter changed uncovered a bug where two of the string comparisons used with `theResetMethod` were typos: They should have been `\"discrete\"` but were instead `\"discreate\"`.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe code compiles.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1594017889", "comments": 18, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1593438490", "deletions": 95, "labels": ["bug-fix", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "hlt-approved", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "dd3e8fa1f34195f13cb83f30094a4fcd5866ffad", "merged_at": "1594017889", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 30455, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix TSGFromPropagation", "updated_at": "1594017889", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

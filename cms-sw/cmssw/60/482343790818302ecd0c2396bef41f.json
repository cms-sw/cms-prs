We plan to use GED photons as our main analysis workhorse for run2 data, using the legacy reconstruction as an aide in commissioning. Currently the GED photons are already run during RECO, but they are not saved in the event content or run through DQM. This PR adds them to the event content and the DQM pathways.\n\nThe first set of commissioning plots, comparing the legacy photon reco and the GED reco in HI MC can be found in this meeting:\nhttps://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/CMS/PhotonAnalyses2015#2015_08_11_13_30_CET\n\nThis PR should not change any pp workflows. We expect event size to only increase slightly (the photon collections are generally not large). Local tests show that the GED DQM plots show up properly under the egamma heading.\n\nWe also will backport to 75X for datataking. @yetkinyilmaz , @mandrenguyen , and @yenjie are probably interested in this.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1439620604", "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1439313995", "deletions": 8, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "951e277e000628d8f9fc4382830d590f634e5bf9", "merged_at": "1439620604", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 10700, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 8, "state": "closed", "title": "Put GED photons into HI event content and DQM pathways", "updated_at": "1439620604", "user": "richard-cms"}

There are two changes\r\n\r\nseed eta is added to the endcap as an input variable to help the regression be more stable with high eta. This is the last variable the regression and the current 74X regressions simply ignore it.\r\n\r\na bug was fixed in the calculation of sigmaIEtaIPhi, it was always not set as sigmaIPhiIPhi was always set to std::numeric_limits::max() when it was being constructed. The option to reapply that bug is available.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\n\r\nbackport  of : https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/26763", "branch": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1559798731", "comments": 16, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1558003193", "deletions": 11, "labels": ["backport-ok", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "64de087c3b70fdaa36d8602f878cd964b3a46428", "merged_at": "1559798731", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 26797, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "updating SC reg corrector for UL regression: 106X", "updated_at": "1559798731", "user": "Sam-Harper"}

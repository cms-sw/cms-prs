The decision was if one uses a Propagator one must first `clone` the object. This change removes `const` from all the actually non-const member functions and then changes all APIs in CMSSW which were using those methods.\nThis change is necessary for thread-safety. \n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "changed_files": 260, "closed_at": "1395921770", "comments": 47, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1395083461", "deletions": 927, "labels": ["alca-pending", "analysis-pending", "dqm-pending", "fastsim-pending", "generators-pending", "l1-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "tests-rejected"], "milestone": "CMSSW_7_1_0_pre6", "number": 2906, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "Remove mutables from Propagators", "updated_at": "1440594587", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

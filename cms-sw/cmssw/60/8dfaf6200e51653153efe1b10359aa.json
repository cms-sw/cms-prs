This means the modules are then also ran in the offline DQM.\r\n- Ignore BX range mismatches for BMTF and EMTF data to emulator comparison in the summary.\r\n- Remove the old unpacker for CaloLayer1 and use the rawToDigi standard sequence instead.\r\n- Remove unneeded unpackers from the online DQM clients.\r\n- Add the ESProducer for the ideal magnetic field to the online client because it is needed by the EMTF emulator.\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_9_4_X", "changed_files": 10, "closed_at": "1517217275", "comments": 9, "commits": 10, "created_at": "1510849255", "deletions": 128, "labels": ["backport-ok", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_9_4_X", "number": 21340, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "L1T online and offline DQM configuration upgrades - 94x", "updated_at": "1517217275", "user": "thomreis"}

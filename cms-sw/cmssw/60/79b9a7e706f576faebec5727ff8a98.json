This completes the list of input variables for various lepton MAV flavors and allows to evaluate them on nanoAOD.\r\n\r\n- Added DQM plots\r\n\r\nThe variables amount to ~2.5 bytes/event, i.e. a 0.1% increase in the overall size as checked by @swertz \r\n\r\nShould be included in the next legacy and ultra-legacy nanoAOD production.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested in private top nanoAOD production\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with any link to  -->\r\n\r\nBefore submitting your pull requests, make sure you followed this checklist:\r\n- verify that the PR is really intended for the chosen branch\r\n- verify that changes follow [CMS Naming, Coding, And Style Rules](http://cms-sw.github.io/cms_coding_rules.html)\r\n- verify that the PR passes the basic test procedure suggested in the [CMSSW PR instructions](https://cms-sw.github.io/PRWorkflow.html)\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1603891300", "comments": 20, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1603731364", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved", "xpog-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "2ead143b96217b99baf5e4d95be6aa7ba8e134e9", "merged_at": "1603891300", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 31944, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "jetNDauChargedMVASel for nanoAOD electrons & muons for topMVA inputs", "updated_at": "1603891300", "user": "schoef"}

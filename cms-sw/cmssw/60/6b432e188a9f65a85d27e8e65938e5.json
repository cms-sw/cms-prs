Currently none of this code is run centrally however it is intended to be added to validation workflows in the near future once we are happy the validation is exactly what we want. \r\n\r\nIt consists of a general code cleanup of the modules, the ability to plot masses, bug fixes where it wasnt working well with the current DQM system, addition of resolution plots, addition of hadronic taus and fixes to the config syntax to more easily make the plots. \r\n\r\nIt also adds customisations to add this to any config. \r\n\r\nIt is designed to work with https://cmshltvalidation.app.cern.ch which displays these results. It is intended to run a basic validation on demand which is somewhere between the usual runTheMatrix and PR tests and a full scale validation. \r\n\r\nThis was most recently presented at https://indico.cern.ch/event/1426780/contributions/6008585/attachments/2880267/5045796/cmshltvalidation.pdf\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe plots in  https://cmshltvalidation.app.cern.ch look as expected\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is still a draft PR and is not yet ready to be reviewed\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 18, "comments": 9, "commits": 22, "created_at": "1719837714", "deletions": 168, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_2_X", "number": 45355, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Improvements to HLT Validation", "updated_at": "1725349018", "user": "Sam-Harper"}

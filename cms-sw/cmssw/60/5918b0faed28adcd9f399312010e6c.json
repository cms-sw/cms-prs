This avoids crashes like the ones reported in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/39568\r\n\r\nFor events with data corruption in a tower a difference in the number of unpacked digis can occur between the CPU unpacker and the GPU one because the former stops unpacking the tower if an inconsistency is detected in one channel, whereas the later unpacks the channels in parallel and an inconsistency in one channel does not affect the unpacking in other threads.\r\nIn many cases, however, an integrity problem in the raw data affects most of the channels in the tower. From the three instances reported in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/39568 this year only one resulted in a difference of one digi being produced after the fix.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n* Does not crash anymore on runs 367771, 368547, 368724 set up with the recipe provided in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/39568#issuecomment-1557565628 .\r\n* Passes matrix tests 12434.512, 12434.513, and 12434.514\r\n* No differences seen between CPU and GPU digis on 7750 events from /store/relval/CMSSW_13_0_0/RelValTTbarToDilepton_14TeV/GEN-SIM-DIGI-RAW/130X_mcRun3_2022_realistic_v2-v3/00000/\r\n\r\nBackport of #41977 for HLT to avoid crashes when encountering invalid detector IDs in the raw data.", "branch": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 6, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1686859420", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "backport", "ecal"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "number": 41980, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "ECAL - Add integrity checks for strip and xtal ids to GPU unpacker - 130X", "updated_at": "1686903199", "user": "thomreis"}

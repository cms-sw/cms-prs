This PR changes std::auto_ptr to std::unique_ptr in the documentation, comments, and the example script.\nShould not affect anything, but since some of the comments are in C++ header files, it will cause a big rebuild.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 8, "closed_at": "1459316764", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1459262336", "deletions": 24, "labels": ["comparison-available", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "tests-rejected"], "merge_commit_sha": "674404c8d60c5acd9cdc8c1561193115bcac9af1", "merged_at": "1459316764", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 13855, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Change auto_ptr to unique_ptr in text", "updated_at": "1464230204", "user": "wmtan"}

No regressions are expected as the generated configurations should be verbatim the same.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nNot a backport, no backport is needed.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 56, "closed_at": "1603293996", "comments": 16, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1602675200", "deletions": 57, "labels": ["alca-approved", "analysis-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "db-pending", "dqm-approved", "orp-approved", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved", "urgent"], "merge_commit_sha": "0e81ac15f8858c66efedae259703de695b07b786", "merged_at": "1603293996", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 31788, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "move from MagneticField_AutoFromDBCurrent_cff to MagneticField in all Tracker-related configurations", "updated_at": "1603293997", "user": "mmusich"}

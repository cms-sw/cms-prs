This ability was useful to understand the TFile/TTree structure in the context of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/47750\r\n\r\nThe earlier ability to print cluster information (from https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/48044) turned out to be straightforward to generalize a bit. The first commit of this PR is a cleanup that should have been part of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/48044, but I didn't realize at the time.\r\n\r\nResolves https://github.com/cms-sw/framework-team/issues/1410\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe added option works in a private test", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 21, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1748453025", "deletions": 70, "labels": ["core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 48200, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 14, "state": "open", "title": "Add an option to edmFileUtil to print detailed basket information for a given branch", "updated_at": "1748623586", "user": "makortel"}

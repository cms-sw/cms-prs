As the performance of the PS weights was tuned 5 years ago with the wrong setting and accepted, we plan to use the same for the first MC round of Run3 as additional validation would further delay the start. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nI was asked to initiate the process. Validation is running. Feedback will follow later today. \r\n \r\nThe PR will be back-ported to 12_4. \r\n\r\n@smrenna @Saptaparna @menglu21 @bbilin  \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 0, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1668076509", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["generators-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_6_X", "number": 40038, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "isrptmin2fac option for PS weights in Pythia 8.306 ", "updated_at": "1668076534", "user": "agrohsje"}

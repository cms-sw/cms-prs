This is very strange, because this call works fine from the ROOT command line.  This may or may not be a ROOT bug.  I will write a JIRA ticket against ROOT for this issue.   In the meantime, this simple workaround avoids the problem, because TClass::GetClass(typeid(std::type_info)) works fine in the unit test.  Without this fix/workaround, this unit test will fail when the CMS specific ROOT patch (the TType class) is removed.\n\nPlease merge this request as soon as convenient.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_ROOT6_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1419964776", "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1419958667", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "core-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "ae69efa79d2749c13e41a5e7b39f0ff590866fa7", "merged_at": "1419964776", "merged_by": "ktf", "number": 7023, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "workaround for possible ROOT bug", "updated_at": "1419976229", "user": "wmtan"}

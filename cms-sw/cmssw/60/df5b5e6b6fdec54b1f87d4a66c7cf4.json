The major changes are:\r\n\r\n1. AK4 CHS jets, AK4 Puppi jets and AK4 Gen jets are reclustered from MiniAODs and are used to replace slimmedJets, slimmedJetsPuppi and slimmedGenJets. The rationale behind this is to store very low pt jets (as low as 2 GeV) needed for jet energy scale and resolution studies by JERC group.\r\n2. AK4 Puppi jets have almost the same set of variables stored as AK4 CHS jets. To be used for performance comparison studies between AK4 CHS jets and AK4 Puppi jets.\r\n3. Add PF jet multiplicity variables for different PF candidate types.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nThis PR needs to be backported to 10_6_X, once merged, for the ultra legacy campaigns.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1596733816", "comments": 27, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1594714277", "deletions": 609, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved", "xpog-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "2cceb0ad51cec0afe51654a191cab4cc13b8f35f", "merged_at": "1596733816", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 30674, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Major updates for Custom JME NanoAODs", "updated_at": "1596733817", "user": "nurfikri89"}

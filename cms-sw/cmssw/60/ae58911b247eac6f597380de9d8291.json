After HCAL local reconstruction was ported to Alpaka, the PFRecHitSoAProducer in HLT was updated to directly consume the HCAL rechit SoA and eliminated an intermediate conversion step. The corresponding change was not made for the offline workflows, and is done here.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nValidated on CMSSW_15_0_0_pre2 running WFs: `12834.423` and `12834.496`\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

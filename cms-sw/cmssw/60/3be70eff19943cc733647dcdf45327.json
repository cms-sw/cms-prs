As there was only a single updated tag, which affects only a small range of IOVs near MWGR1, no changes are expected in any workflow. These changes are being made as a matter of principle, to keep `autoCond` up to date.\r\n\r\nThis PR is a backport of #31358. The GT used here is the same as that used in the PR to master. Relative to the PR to master, there is an additional update to PPS tags which had already been included in the version of `autoCond` in the master branch. These PPS updates should not affect any workflow.\r\n\r\n**Run 3 data (prompt)**\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/110X_dataRun3_Prompt_v3/111X_dataRun3_Prompt_v2\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n`runTheMatrix.py -l 138.1 --ibeos`\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nThis PR is a backport of #31358. It is needed because we would like to exercise workflows for Run-3 data in the release series used in MWGRs.\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1599604735", "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1599572468", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["alca-approved", "backport-ok", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "8719b10bfc33757af5cd17277cc993aa4761ae12", "merged_at": "1599604735", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 31392, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Update Run 3 data GTs to those used in 2020 MWGR3 [11_1_X]", "updated_at": "1599604736", "user": "christopheralanwest"}

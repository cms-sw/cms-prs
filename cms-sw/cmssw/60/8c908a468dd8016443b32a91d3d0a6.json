The nature of the problem caused digis to not be produced for this FED.\n- Moreover, a patch implemented by Pierre some time ago prevents DCC desync errors--which normally trigger the Integrity Summary to show RED--to no longer be propagated to the DQM, so DQM thinks there are no errors and that the occupancy is just harmlessly low/zero\n\n(2) At the moment, an FE in DISABLED state is not a trigger for Raw Data Quality to show RED.\n- Also in collisions run 278821, the entire EE+04 was in RawData=DISABLED, with no raw data (and so digis and rechits) being produced for the entire FED. The whole run had to be flagged as BAD as a result.\n- As approved by PFG, the severity of the problem warrants RawData=DISABLED to be included in the list of states that should be set to show RED, as implemented in this fix\n\nIn conjunction with 80X PR https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/15552\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1471943541", "comments": 7, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1471882546", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "b1a6bd05c4bd79ef984b88f307fa4eab7bae690f", "merged_at": "1471943541", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 15553, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Set Global Quality to show RED when FE is disabled", "updated_at": "1471943542", "user": "mbandrews"}

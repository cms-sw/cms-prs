It is needed to run highPU phase2 workflows smoothly in the computing system.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 31, "closed_at": "1581512889", "comments": 14, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1581049043", "deletions": 13, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "generators-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "upgrade-pending", "urgent"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 28880, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Using CP5 tune generator fragments for Phase2/Run3 RelVal samples", "updated_at": "1581512890", "user": "siddhesh86"}

So it's copying some wrong portions of memory. This was noted in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/40604 and this solves it.\r\n\r\nThis fix is quick and dirty, given also this CUDA to legacy copy will be dropped soon.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRun `11634.59x`.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1677588406", "comments": 33, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1677223146", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-pending", "bug-fix", "orp-approved", "urgent", "code-checks-approved", "heterogeneous-approved", "tracking"], "merge_commit_sha": "2ca13421ced358df72e1d76e8dce4c42b27388d9", "merged_at": "1677588406", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_13_1_X", "number": 40869, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix `cudaMemcpyAsync` for `localCoordToHostAsync`", "updated_at": "1677588407", "user": "AdrianoDee"}

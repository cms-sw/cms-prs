CMSSW software needs to be modified to handle that. Following\nhttps://hypernews.cern.ch/HyperNews/CMS/get/recoDevelopment/1302.html\nI am making changes to different packages, here JET/MET for fastjet usage. Changing the types in fastjet would be a longer process so I just explicitly cast to the supported type (the run/event numbers are used as random seeds - there should be no practical problem here).  Updates are generally trivial and there should be no any visible effects of them (except for the rare event numbers with > 32 bits). \n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_3_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1415283729", "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1415257393", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "627354eff788ca3585757944c531f202afc9ca83", "merged_at": "1415283729", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_3_X", "number": 6229, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Update types of event/run/lumi in Jet/MET (for fastjet)", "updated_at": "1415283729", "user": "StoyanStoynev"}

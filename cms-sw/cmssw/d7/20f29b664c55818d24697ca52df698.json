This reqired also implementing some missing features and fixing some bugs. (also @fioriNTU @davidcarbonis )\n- Allow creating acutal `TProfile`s in step1. \n- Also allow that in 2D.\n- Move larger parts of the specifications into a central place, to make it easier to change \"defaults\". This is pure python magic.\n- Slightly change the semantics of specifications involving counts and time on one axis. This leads to a more useful output that could not be specified outherwise, but the definition is a bit vague.\n- [Update] also adds the error bars in the profile-like plots from harvesting.\n- [Update 2] Fix a bug in the trend plots that potentially also affected others.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 12, "closed_at": "1470330474", "comments": 12, "commits": 10, "created_at": "1469439775", "deletions": 300, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "tests-rejected"], "merge_commit_sha": "33f0372aecc5c3f319f36e98d95f657a0bba46d4", "merged_at": "1470330474", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 15275, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "Phase1 Pixel DQM Plot Changes", "updated_at": "1470330475", "user": "schneiml"}

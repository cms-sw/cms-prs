This code resides in a new package DataFormats/TCDS. It replaces the FED1024 class which exposes direct access to the underlying data structure, and incorporates the separate BSTRecord. I also changed the code using the old accessors to the new ones, as far as I could find them. In addition, the EventAuxiliary is now filled with the current fill (store) number instead of 'edm::EventAuxiliary::invalidStoreNumber'.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 452, "closed_at": "1505202929", "comments": 71, "commits": 232, "created_at": "1504619170", "deletions": 11192, "labels": ["alca-pending", "analysis-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "core-pending", "daq-pending", "db-pending", "dqm-pending", "generators-pending", "geometry-pending", "hlt-pending", "l1-pending", "new-package-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "tests-approved", "upgrade-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_9_4_X", "number": 20387, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 7, "state": "closed", "title": "Persist TCDS FED payload", "updated_at": "1505215695", "user": "mommsen"}

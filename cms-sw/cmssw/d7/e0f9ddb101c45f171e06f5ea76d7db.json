Then I noticed the script tries to use `gccxml`, via `scram tool info gccxml`. Scram does not provide such a tool, and therefore the script can not function. (digging from history it was removed in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmsdist/pull/1581, so maybe the script has been obsolete since we moved to ROOT6?)\r\n\r\nGiven the present situation I'd just remove the script.\r\n\r\nResolves https://github.com/cms-sw/framework-team/issues/972\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI checked with `git grep` that nothing in CMSSW itself refers to `edmAddClassVersion`. I search in the `cms-sw` GitHub organization and found nothing referring to it (beyond the code itself in three copies of the framework), whereas search for `edmCheckClassVersion` shows many hits.\r\n\r\nTwiki search shows a reference in https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/SWGuideCreatingNewProducts#Class_versioning, which I'll update.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1722276725", "deletions": 324, "labels": ["core-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 45584, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Remove `edmAddClassVersion` script as obsolete", "updated_at": "1722276877", "user": "makortel"}

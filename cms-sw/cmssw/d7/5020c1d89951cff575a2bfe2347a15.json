While the correct value is cut upon, the returned value is incorrect and this fixes it. \r\n\r\nMany thanks to @oglez (Oscar Gonzalez Lopez) for spotting and reporting the issue!\r\n\r\nThis bug has no impact on anything centrally run (we dont retrieve this value in any e/gamma workflow, its purely for users) so we expect zero changes. However our users may use this (and in fact do) so it needs to be fixed, also 10_6_X.\r\n\r\nOn code, there was the suggestion that the cut function should just use the result of the value function, on the face of it its a good idea however it means we have an extra dynamic cast + function call hence I kept it as is. \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nSam", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1567965651", "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1567748580", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "5cd7cfdd8cb2731c45c7c8ef212b76ddf0bae0e6", "merged_at": "1567965651", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27944, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fixing VID return value for HEEP Trk Iso: 11_0_X", "updated_at": "1567965651", "user": "Sam-Harper"}

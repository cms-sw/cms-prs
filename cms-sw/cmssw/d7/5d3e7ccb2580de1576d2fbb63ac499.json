Comparing to this value involves constructing an `InputTag` object and then using its equality operator, which is unnecessarily expensive. The `InputTag` fields (strings) have STL `empty()` accessors that immediately return the desired status. This PR wraps those into a single accessor for convenience.\r\n\r\nAll such comparisons that I could find with `git grep` are updated.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles. (Did not try a full checkdeps recompilation because it requires 922 packages; will leave that for the bot.)\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

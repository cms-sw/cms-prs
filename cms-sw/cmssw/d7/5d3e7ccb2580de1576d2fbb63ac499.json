Comparing to this value involves constructing an `InputTag` object and then using its equality operator, which is unnecessarily expensive. The `InputTag` fields (strings) have STL `empty()` accessors that immediately return the desired status. This PR wraps those into a single accessor for convenience.\r\n\r\nAll such comparisons that I could find with `git grep` are updated.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles. (Did not try a full checkdeps recompilation because it requires 922 packages; will leave that for the bot.)\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nNot a backport, not intended to be backported.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 13, "comments": 15, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1755025733", "deletions": 19, "labels": ["simulation-pending", "dqm-pending", "l1-pending", "hlt-pending", "alca-pending", "core-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending", "tracking", "trk"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 48730, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "add and use isUninitialized() accessor for InputTag", "updated_at": "1755084116", "user": "kpedro88"}

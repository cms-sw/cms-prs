This is done by adding a similar-sized vector of unsigned int datatype. The conversion from CMS datatype DetId to unsigned int is implicit. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis implementation has been cross-checked to correctly store all relevant information. The implicit conversion from DetId to unsigned int has also been verified. I re-ran the scouting path on a small set of events to ensure that there is no error in implementation and that the output that is of interest is stored.\r\n\r\nThe coding recommendations at http://cms-sw.github.io/cms_coding_rules.html were followed.\r\nThe basic test procedure was also successful. \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 0, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1645099967", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["hlt-pending", "core-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 36990, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Add the detector ids to the scouting electron and photon collection for Run 3", "updated_at": "1645099989", "user": "arsahasransu"}

This is done by adding a similar-sized vector of unsigned int datatype. The conversion from CMS datatype DetId to unsigned int is implicit. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis implementation has been cross-checked to correctly store all relevant information. The implicit conversion from DetId to unsigned int has also been verified. I re-ran the scouting path on a small set of events to ensure that there is no error in implementation and that the output that is of interest is stored.\r\n\r\nThe coding recommendations at http://cms-sw.github.io/cms_coding_rules.html were followed.\r\nThe basic test procedure was also successful. \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1645451642", "comments": 23, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1645099967", "deletions": 12, "labels": ["core-approved", "hlt-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "95eed0c02185c99501d2355a751357b0bb5db934", "merged_at": "1645451642", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 36990, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 16, "state": "closed", "title": "Add the detector ids to the scouting electron and photon collection for Run 3", "updated_at": "1645451642", "user": "arsahasransu"}

By storing all gen-jets that we produce, there is no need to recluster gen-jets with MiniAOD and the gen-jets retain their `partonFlavour` values, as calculated at RECO level. For reco-jets that are reclustered with MiniAOD inputs, their flavour labelling can be retrieved from matched gen-jets. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n- Passes the usual runTheMatrix test: `runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos` with the exception of a few workflows which failed because of missing relval input files.\r\n\r\n- The event size increases from 83.83 to 84.58 kb/event (+0.9%), using an MC TTto4Q `RunIII2024Summer24` AOD file as the input test file.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1734467866", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "xpog-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_0_X", "number": 46981, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[MiniAOD] Remove slimmedGenJets minimum pt cut", "updated_at": "1736265093", "user": "nurfikri89"}

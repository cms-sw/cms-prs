The idea is to provide two SDs from Muon (Z+jets) and EGamma (Photon+jets) PDs streamed by specific HLT paths. \r\n\r\nIn this PR we offer the following:\r\n- PDWG_EGMJME_SD_cff.py: This file filters the HLT path for the EGamma PD\r\n- PDWG_MUOJME_SD_cff.py: This file filters the HLT path for the Muon PD\r\n- Skims_PDWG_cff.py: This is updated with the event content to be requested. We have set up RAW-RECO (not just RAW because we have experienced troubles with RAW as SD within T0; see ReseverDMu example)\r\n- autoSkim.py: This is updated for two purposes: \r\n1- in the scope of this PR, 2022 has Muon and EGamma, and 2023 has EGamma[0,1] and Muon[0,1]\r\n2- given that a full ReRECO of 2022 and 2023 is on the horizon, 2022 PDs have been allowed (removed the #) so that PdmV can ask for the Skims as a whole for all the PDs.\r\n\r\nThere will be a backport to 13_3_X and 13_0_X. \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nPPD", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 0, "commits": 9, "created_at": "1702139856", "deletions": 13, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "number": 43534, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Adding Two Secondary Datasets for JME POG", "updated_at": "1702139879", "user": "jordan-martins"}

All involved configuration parameters have been assigned to RefToPSet so that their handling all along the release is cleaner and not subject to the specific load sequences of the different cff/cfi/cfg involved in different steps (DIGI+RECO).\r\nI decided to leave the customization as is (i.e. via a call to customize) rather than migrate everything to some specific sub-era since many other detectors would have been affected. It could be an improvement for the future if deemed useful.\r\nFinally, I modified the customization function that now has only to change the RefToPset definitions in order to perform its task.\r\n\r\n@malgeri", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 10, "closed_at": "1525841824", "comments": 21, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1524806515", "deletions": 232, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "191de73528c06f7fcbd677cd95cb15b844dc6171", "merged_at": "1525841824", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 23076, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix hgcal ageing", "updated_at": "1525841824", "user": "rovere"}

I've adjusted the 'standard' ranges and binning so that the overall number of bins is slightly reduced so there is no increase in resource usage.\r\n\r\nPR validation:\r\n\r\nValidated on several runs with 250 events of run3 TTbar workflow using\r\nrunTheMatrix.py -l 11634.0 --command=\"-n 250\"\r\n\r\nscram b code-format shows no suggestions for change.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1630664705", "comments": 7, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1630587410", "deletions": 44, "labels": ["dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "7f1e2f101f9b3a176e9dc5f40d3864f27be8bcb7", "merged_at": "1630664705", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "number": 35129, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix filling and multiplicity ranges", "updated_at": "1630664705", "user": "ptcox"}

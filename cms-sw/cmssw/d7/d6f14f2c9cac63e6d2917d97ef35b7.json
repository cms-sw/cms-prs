In the later case, the `Alpaka Queue` is the first argument, while in the first case it is the other way around. This PR addresses the problem and sets the `Alpaka Queue` always as the **first** argument. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, the constructors of the `PortableCollections` are streamlined to always use `std::integal` as the input type for the elements. Then a `checked_cast` has been implemented that checks if casting to `int` is safe. If so, the inputs are casted to `int`. Casting to `int` is necessary since the `SoA Layouts` use `int` for the number of elements due to the dependency on `ROOT`. \r\n\r\nThis PR has to be addressed after #49734. \r\n\r\n@felicepantaleo fyi", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 96, "comments": 54, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1768810822", "deletions": 356, "labels": ["geometry-pending", "alca-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "db-approved", "urgent", "code-checks-approved", "heterogeneous-approved", "tracking", "trk", "tests-ib-failure", "ml-pending", "ngt"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_1_X", "number": 49860, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 42, "state": "open", "title": "Refactor of PortableCollections", "updated_at": "1769666768", "user": "Electricks94"}

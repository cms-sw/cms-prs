It allows to reduce memory usage for typical fits done by Muon POG from ~20GB down to 1-2GB. The code runs significantly slower in the new mode, so it shouldn't be a default option. The change should not affect any code unless the new mode is requested explicitly and even in this case all results should be the same.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1524217746", "comments": 15, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1522935887", "deletions": 44, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "orp-approved", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "7ecedc222d7fc05b9fbc8ea906e2806a97fa8e38", "merged_at": "1524217746", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 22861, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "[Tag-N-Probe] Split read mode ", "updated_at": "1524217746", "user": "drkovalskyi"}

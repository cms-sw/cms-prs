That vector was passed to `SiTrackerMultiRecHitUpdator` which passes each individual entry to `TransientTrackingRecHitBuilder::build()` which then clones the hit. The original hit was never deleted.\n\nBoth the false positive and the memory leak were fixed by using `std::unique_ptr<>`\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1431440296", "comments": 8, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1431368801", "deletions": 15, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "4bb478744553926e6150b2596564040c7acd494a", "merged_at": "1431440296", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 9043, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix memory leak in SimpleDAFHitCollector", "updated_at": "1439569975", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

Encountering hits from either of these two collections was leading to a runtime exception of the type:\r\n   \r\n```   \r\n----- Begin Fatal Exception 05-Jul-2023 19:33:49 CEST-----------------------\r\nAn exception of category 'Unknown RecHit Type' occurred while\r\n   [0] Processing  Event run: 370102 lumi: 668 event: 1557577232 stream: 0\r\n   [1] Running path 'p'\r\n   [2] Calling method for module TrackerTrackHitFilter/'TrackerTrackHitFilter'\r\n   \r\nException Message:\r\nRecHit of type 22SiStripMatchedRecHit2D not supported. (use c++filt to demangle the name)\r\n----- End Fatal Exception -------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\nThese two collections (as the previously stated in the removed comment) did not happen anymore since CMSSW > 2_0_X because of hit splitting in stereo modules in offline reconstruction, but in HLT tracking stereo hit splitting is not performed.\r\nIn order to cope with the  `SiStripMatchedRecHit2D`, the cut on the S/N is performed by taking the average of the stereo and mono hits.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested the minimal configuration provided by @henriettepetersen (available [here](https://gist.github.com/mmusich/ff4d8ba8d9b852e67ffad514dc026cbf)).\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

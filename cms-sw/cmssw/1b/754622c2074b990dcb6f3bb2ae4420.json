All such particles are then checked to see if their decay vertex is outside the beampipe; if so it will be passed to GEANT for simulation.  \n\nThis fix addresses the problem of a long-lived exotic particle with status code > 3 (e.g., an R-hadron, or chargino), which decays outside the beampipe.  Before this fix, its detector interactions would not be simulated by GEANT, because this module was looking specifically for status values of 1, 2, or 3.  \n\nThis fix has been tested for the case of di-chargino pair production, with the chargino ctau set to 1000 cm (decaying to neutralino + pion).  Before the fix, there are no tracks associated to the chargino because no energy deposits have been simulated by GEANT.  After the fix, there are reconstructed tracks for each chargino.  \n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1478873193", "comments": 24, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1477516985", "deletions": 8, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "generators-approved", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "ef1bd26af7d0bfb415ebad364686d361da2777c9", "merged_at": "1478873193", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 16366, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Ensure GEANT simulation of exotic long-lived particles that decay outside beampipe", "updated_at": "1478873194", "user": "wulsin"}

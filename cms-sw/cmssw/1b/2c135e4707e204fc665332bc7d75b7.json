This piece of information is now correctly propagated through the clustering algorithm until the end. \r\nAlso the fact that the uncertainty was based so far on a sigle pixel size, instead of propagating the uncertainty on a weighted average of pixels is now fixed.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nExtensive checks were done using the test workflow 20903.0 (single muons with flat pT in the range [0.7,10] GeV).\r\nThe pull distribution in x has now a properly behaved shape, as shown in the presentation.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 7, "comments": 15, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1669302950", "deletions": 62, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "upgrade-approved", "requires-external", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "number": 40146, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 4, "state": "open", "title": "MTD reconstruction: fix local cluster position and uncertainty determination", "updated_at": "1669620916", "user": "fabiocos"}

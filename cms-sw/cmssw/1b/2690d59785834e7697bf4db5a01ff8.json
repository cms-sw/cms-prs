This is done according to the GitLab issue: https://gitlab.cern.ch/cms-btv-coordination/tasks/-/issues/149\r\n\r\nAfter applying the changes, meaningful plots on the discriminator score against the kinematics were available and filled with events when running the runTheMatrix workflow 16834.0 (TTbar for 2025 conditions), under the folder `HLT/BTV/Validation/Discriminator`. It was tested with 100 events, and the resulting file is available at https://cernbox.cern.ch/s/h2MnUZOVTEfc8sv. It can be easily reproduced with the command `runTheMatrix.py --command=\"-n 100\" -t 4 -l 16834.0`\r\n\r\nAs a caveat, plots on the input features are not yet available with this PR. Those features are considerably different for ParticleNet as compared to DeepCSV and would need more work on the code. However, the validation is already possible with the plots this PR provides, and another PR can be made fixing the input features in the future for completeness.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1739858944", "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1739470782", "deletions": 59, "labels": ["dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved", "btv"], "merge_commit_sha": "0dfa637145ab52b7131777c88467c67b73c565fb", "merged_at": "1739858944", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 47344, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Updated HLT BTV validation paths from DeepCSV to PNet", "updated_at": "1739858945", "user": "brunolopesbr2"}

It adds in particleFlow in the barrel so it can be easily recombined with pfTICL candidates to make the full pf collection. It also tweaks the egamma event format, adding back in the gsftracks and gsfelectrons which are useful for particle flow integrations (and do not take up much space).  As well as adding muons1stStep2muonsMap for particle flow combinations. \r\n\r\nIt adds in the TTCluster association map of accepted clusters needed for tracking particle association to L1 tracks. As well L1 HGCAL multi clusters mainly as they take up little space and could possibly be useful. \r\n\r\nFinally it cleans out the lowPt electrons and uncleaned electron collections as both are not really needed (uncleaned is ecal debuging, lowPt, well we're not going to be triggering <2 GeV electrons at 200 PU, at least not in the TDR\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nevent content looks as expected \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1596091123", "comments": 12, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1596051130", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "hlt-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved", "urgent"], "merge_commit_sha": "5ec0e1bfcb8e104d3b3593f0dfb81dd0e20b9b2e", "merged_at": "1596091123", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 30972, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "HLT TDR event content refinements: 11_2_X", "updated_at": "1596094186", "user": "Sam-Harper"}

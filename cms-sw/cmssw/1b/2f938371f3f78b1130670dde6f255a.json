So I change that.\r\n** HV status histogram: If the scalersRawToDigi (DCS bit) not found, then HV status is 0 (HV was off). If not, then HV status is 1 (HV was on)\r\n*** This data has 576 LumiSection\r\n\r\n![changing module - before and after](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11341914/89392451-835ed680-d744-11ea-8194-baf2573ddc11.PNG)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested by runTheMatrix 138.1 (RunCosmics2020, MWGR data) with multi-thread and single-thread\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\n@andresib @jhgoh \r\nI make the new PR about changing the RPC DQM legacy module.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": "1597759059", "comments": 55, "commits": 8, "created_at": "1596611480", "deletions": 155, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "efae9ca7094c8abaa864244265ea9cd45b466a4f", "merged_at": "1597759059", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 31056, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "[RPC] Changing the RPCDcsInfo* about an issue of the DQM legacy module", "updated_at": "1597759060", "user": "jeongsumin"}

Then I rebased it to CMSSW_13_2_0_pre2\r\n- The extra variables needed for Muon POG are directly added to PhysicsTools/NanoAOD/python/muons_cff.py\r\n- To add some variables an EDProducer was needed. And it is PhysicsTools/NanoAOD/plugins/MuonSpecialVariables.cc\r\n- An EDProducer was also needed to produce tracks from Particle Flow candidates. It is in PhysicsTools/NanoAOD/plugins/pfTracksProducer.cc. and the corresponding python file is PhysicsTools/NanoAOD/python/pfTracks_cff.py\r\n- To save only the muons in the final NanoAOD, I modified PhysicsTools/NanoAOD/python/NanoAODEDMEventContent_cff.py\r\n\r\nI have checked the code compiles and run. I have also checked the output NanoAOD is in the expected format.\r\n\r\nI have also checked that the code passes the basic tests mentioned in https://cms-sw.github.io/PRWorkflow.html", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 33, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1687355190", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "upgrade-approved", "code-checks-approved", "xpog-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_3_X", "number": 42039, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 11, "state": "open", "title": "Custom_Muon_POG_NanoAOD", "updated_at": "1696229740", "user": "rbhattacharya04"}

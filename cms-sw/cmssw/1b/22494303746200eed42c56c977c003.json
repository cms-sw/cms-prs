EMTF DAQ readout window is 7 BX wide [-3, 3], but in cases of corrupted data from TPs or faulty configurations it can have a value of 4.\r\n\r\nApaprently, such cases happened during LS2 when GEMs were not working properly. Unpacking this data and trying to use the DQM plots added in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/38818 causes a crash. \r\n\r\nThis PR adds a veto for any TP or EMTF track that falls out of this [-3, 3] window since these are clearly not valid.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with a description of the feature proposed or problem addressed, specifying:\r\n  - what changes are expected in the output if any, \r\n  - what other PRs or externals it depends upon if any,\r\n  - link to any additional material useful to provide a documentation for this PR (slides, JIRA tickets, related pull requestes, hypernews, TWiki or Indico pages)  -->\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nValidated with the failing workflows from https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/38940.

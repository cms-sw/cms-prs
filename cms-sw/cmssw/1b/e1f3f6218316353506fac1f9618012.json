It is re-added in PAT to keep it from crashing, although we will not write mini-AOD.  Inclusive vertexing, PF MET and, V0s and conversions are effectively removed by setting high thresholds.  This strategy keeps from having to fix a lot of crashes in mini-AOD, DQM, and validation that would arise due to missing collections.  These collections are rarely or never used in heavy ions and be created from AOD, which is the main output tier. \r\n\r\nThese modifications, which leading to significant timing improvements,  were discussed at RECO/AT:\r\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/711247/contributions/2920696/attachments/1614694/2565613/RecoTiming_180309_MAN.pdf\r\n\r\nTested with workflow 158.  \r\nWill need to be backported to 10_2_X, if we use that for data-taking (there's no effect on pp reco) ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 8, "closed_at": "1534963629", "comments": 41, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1533638645", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "operations-pending", "orp-approved", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "ab2e23a109cb27fa971d681415be121835684b35", "merged_at": "1534963629", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_3_X", "number": 24224, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 6, "state": "closed", "title": "Exclude taus, IVF and other high-level reco features from Run2_2018_pp_on_AA era", "updated_at": "1534963629", "user": "mandrenguyen"}

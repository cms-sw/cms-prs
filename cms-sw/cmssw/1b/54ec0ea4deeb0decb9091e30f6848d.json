Currently, these checks will throw an exception if one or both of the types in question is not a class.  The check should be more general.  This pull request changes the check for inheritance to simply return false if one or both of the types is not a class.\nPlease merge promptly unless there are issues.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_2_ROOT6_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1404142291", "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1404141610", "deletions": 12, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "core-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "ec782b225b3b3153bd80adb7c867b144362a3a43", "merged_at": "1404142291", "merged_by": "davidlt", "number": 4459, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Allow inheritance check for non-class types", "updated_at": "1404144774", "user": "wmtan"}

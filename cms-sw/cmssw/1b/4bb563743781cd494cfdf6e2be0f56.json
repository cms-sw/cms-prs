This is a technical PR, and no change in physics is expected.  \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRan the workflow `10824.0` from `CMSSW_12_1_DBG_X_2021-09-30-2300` to reproduce the issue. The issue could be reproduced, and this was the error message:\r\n```\r\n%MSG-e BasicSingleTrajectoryState:  GoodSeedProducer:trackerDrivenElectronSeeds  \r\nRun: 1 Event: 1\r\nasking for componenets to a SingleTrajectoryState\r\n%MSG\r\ncmsRun: /data/cmsbld/jenkins/workspace/build-any-ib/w/tmp/BUILDROOT/8e0ebc7a948785df3d5eabb18ad33031/opt/cmssw/slc7_amd64_gcc900/cms/cmssw/CMSSW_12_1_DBG_X_2021-09-30-2300/src/TrackingTools/TrajectoryState/src/BasicTrajectoryState.cc:248: virtual const Components& BasicSingleTrajectoryState::components() const: Assertion `false' failed.\r\n```\r\nThen merged this branch, compiled and reran the workflow `10824.0`. This time it looks like this issue was resolved. But a different problem was spotted: \r\n```\r\nAn exception of category 'PFECALSuperClusterAlgo::buildSuperCluster' occurred while\r\n...\r\nException Message:\r\nFound a PS cluster matched to more than one EE cluster!\r\n0x7f316c6cb608 == 0x7f316c6c4198\r\n```\r\nthis is coming from here:\r\nhttps://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/RecoEcal/EgammaClusterAlgos/src/PFECALSuperClusterAlgo.cc#L428-L432", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 15, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1633330992", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "number": 35524, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Fix assert in debug builds from GsfTrajectorySmoother", "updated_at": "1633610460", "user": "swagata87"}

This Algo settings key has been tested and validated during several P5 tests together with the new CaloLayer1 firmware and SWATCH software to upload the HCal FB LUT from DB to firmware.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 30, "comments": 1, "commits": 26, "created_at": "1680032144", "deletions": 20, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "dqm-pending", "l1-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-rejected"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_1_X", "number": 41214, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Adding HCal FB LUT to caloParams for uploading to DB", "updated_at": "1680032720", "user": "vshang"}

The fixes are:\r\n* Correct retrieval of track information contained in pat::PackedCandidates in TauChargedHadronProducer;\r\n* Retrieval of individual ECAL and HCAL energies from energy fractions in pat::PackedCandidates in a helper function used by tauIDs and a tau energy algorithm.\r\n\r\nChanges are not expected in official production workflows as updated code deals only with, still experimental, tau reconstruction with miniAOD inputs. The tau reconstruction with miniAOD inputs is run as part of tau reco unit tests and is defined by `RecoTauTag/RecoTau/test/rerunTauRecoOnMiniAOD.py`\r\n \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nReco tau unit tests passed, in particular one defined in `RecoTauTag/RecoTau/test/rerunTauRecoOnMiniAOD.py`\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1606878776", "comments": 23, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1606135363", "deletions": 10, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "59794b97d78272cd3ed15ed68e64fc525b5afbc6", "merged_at": "1606878776", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 32243, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 4, "state": "closed", "title": "Set fixes for tau reco at miniAOD", "updated_at": "1606878777", "user": "mbluj"}

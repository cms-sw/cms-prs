Some notes below.\r\n - Not all the plugins touched by this PR are used in the current Run-3 HLT menu (many plugins in `HLTrigger/*/` are old and unused).\r\n - The changes in this PR are meant to preserve the current behaviour of all involved plugins.\r\n - In plugins where an upper/lower bound on a Delta-R distance is taken from the PSet, the value is converted to Delta-R^2 times the sign of the input value (using `deltaR x |deltaR|`). This preserves the current behaviour of these plugins when a negative `deltaR` value is specified in the PSet.\r\n - The change in throughput for the current Run-3 HLT menu was not quantified. It is assumed to be small (and in the right direction, i.e. faster).\r\n - Minor technical improvements are also applied to some of the plugins touched by this PR.\r\n\r\nMerely technical. No changes expected.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n`addOnTests.py` passed (I did not verify that the trigger results remain exactly the same).\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

The old plugin types were kept in place as duplicates at the request of HLT, to ease the renaming of these plugins in the HLT menus.

No changes expected.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested a small number of workflows with `runTheMatrix.py`.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

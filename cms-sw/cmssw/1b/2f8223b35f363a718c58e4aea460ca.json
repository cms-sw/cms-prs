Suggestion are welcome.**\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nRun the standard battery of tests for the workflows which have been changed:\r\n```\r\n runTheMatrix.py -l 134.710,134.812,134.912,136.732,136.745,136.756,136.767,136.778 -t 4 -j 8 --ibeos\r\n```\r\nwhich passed without issues.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\n\r\nThis is not a backport, though a backport might be needed for the actual 2016 Ultra-Legacy reprocessing.\r\n\r\ncc:\r\n@jandrea @arossi83\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1565719831", "comments": 47, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1565263334", "deletions": 24, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "pdmv-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "32094e4fb1bb54e7c12c063d64bc79975b02b58f", "merged_at": "1565719831", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27727, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 10, "state": "closed", "title": "Move 2015/2016 Data ReReco ZeroBias RelVals to use @rerecoZeroBias DQM sequence", "updated_at": "1566228758", "user": "mmusich"}

Looking towards concurrent lumisections, watching these transitions is a problem.\r\n\r\n- As a first step, this PR removes the unneded code. It should not functionally change anything, except reducing the log output a bit.\r\n- Then, we can evaluate which plugins actually need per-lumi transitions, and enable them only selectively for these plugins in `DQMEDAnalyzer`.\r\n- Finally, since *any* one module watching lumi transitions currently blocks concurrent lumisections, we might want to migrate them to some different implementation that allows concurrent lumis.\r\n\r\n@Dr15Jones @knoepfel FYI", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 160, "closed_at": "1527832226", "comments": 17, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1527681336", "deletions": 647, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "8af7aff587d8f0cec517e6606d0ae4153fd20668", "merged_at": "1527832226", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 23394, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Remove unneeded begin/endLumi methods", "updated_at": "1527832227", "user": "schneiml"}

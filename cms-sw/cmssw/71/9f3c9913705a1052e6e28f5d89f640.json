The affected workflows are the ones using HGCal-PhaseII era.\r\n\r\nI also profited from the existing EGamma-POG DQM to monitor the newly created collections. Yet, minimal changes had to be introduced also there, but the final output for regular (i.e. non-upgrade) workflows should be identical.\r\n\r\n@felicepantaleo @malgeri @cseez @kpedro88 ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 31, "closed_at": "1502805295", "comments": 155, "commits": 36, "created_at": "1501763724", "deletions": 52, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "512d77ca964172c069f3cbe34930afa802c65b1d", "merged_at": "1502805295", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_3_X", "number": 20045, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 67, "state": "closed", "title": "Add MultiCluster derived electrons and photons", "updated_at": "1503337691", "user": "rovere"}

With this PR, the new sequence for re-emulating data is:\r\n\r\n1) EMTF unpacks the received CPPF digis into a CPPFDigiCollection\r\n2) EMTF emulator uses this CPPFDigiCollection in the track-building\r\n\r\nThis brings the fraction of tracks with perfect data-emulator agreement up from ~92% to > 98%.  The emulator logic in MC is unaffected, as there is no CPPFDigi producer in MC at the moment.  The main practical benefit is better data-emulator agreement for DQM monitoring, and for offline performance studies.\r\n\r\nOf potential interest to @jiafulow , @rekovic , @thomreis , @maseguracern , @camilocarrillo , @jhgoh , @mileva, @brieucf\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nAndrew", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 24, "closed_at": "1532276913", "comments": 18, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1530782521", "deletions": 81, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "8ef58a42790d29da1c153205f39c49946a92bfde", "merged_at": "1532276913", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_3_X", "number": 23747, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "EMTF emulate directly from unpacked CPPF digis", "updated_at": "1532276913", "user": "abrinke1"}

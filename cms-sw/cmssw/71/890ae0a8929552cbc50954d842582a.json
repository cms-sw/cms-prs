With this PR, the new sequence for re-emulating data is:\r\n\r\n1) EMTF unpacks the received CPPF digis into a CPPFDigiCollection\r\n2) EMTF emulator uses this CPPFDigiCollection in the track-building\r\n\r\nThis brings the fraction of tracks with perfect data-emulator agreement up from ~92% to > 98%.  The emulator logic in MC is unaffected, as there is no CPPFDigi producer in MC at the moment.  The main practical benefit is better data-emulator agreement for DQM monitoring, and for offline performance studies.\r\n\r\nOf potential interest to @jiafulow , @rekovic , @thomreis , @maseguracern , @camilocarrillo , @jhgoh , @mileva\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nAndrew", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 24, "comments": 2, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1530782521", "deletions": 81, "labels": ["code-checks-rejected", "comparison-pending", "l1-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 23747, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "EMTF emulate directly from unpacked CPPF digis", "updated_at": "1530784632", "user": "abrinke1"}

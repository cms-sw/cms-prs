It is difficult (impossible? please tell me if I'm wrong and this has changed) to get a proper handle in FWLite thus its much easier to just pass in the object itself.  \r\n\r\nIt also adds a root dictionary of the class so its available in pyroot. \r\n\r\nThis means this can be trivially used in pyfwlite and thus I can embed the entire L1 upgrade ntuple in my trees without having to maintain a separate code base. \r\n\r\nIts not a big deal this goes in but it would be nice if possible. \r\n\r\nThis doesnt run in production and regardless, zero changes are expected, its just a function signature change. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nL1ntuples still produced\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1662470775", "deletions": 30, "labels": ["l1-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_6_X", "number": 39318, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Making L1UpgradeNtuples to be more PyFWLite friendly", "updated_at": "1662471280", "user": "Sam-Harper"}

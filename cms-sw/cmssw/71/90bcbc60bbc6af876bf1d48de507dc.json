The variables are also added to NANOAOD.\r\nSuch variables turn out to be useful to discriminate physics jets from noise.\r\n\r\nThe description of the variables and their motivation can be found in this talk:\r\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/944298/#sc-10-4-hf-noise-study-on-aod\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\nBackport of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/31271\r\nNeeded for UL reMINIAOD ", "branch": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": "1600470782", "comments": 41, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1599720968", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "backport-ok", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved", "xpog-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "4ae4f245094f25346c9956c1a7f0149e183cf823", "merged_at": "1600470781", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 31420, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 4, "state": "closed", "title": "HF jet shower shape (106X backport)", "updated_at": "1600470782", "user": "lathomas"}

The CICADA model used in the emulator represents the first version of CICADA to be tested on trigger testing hardware, and is loaded from the `CICADA` external as `CICADAModel_v1`.\r\n\r\nThis PR supersedes #40277.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nDue to this emulator not being associated with any standard workflows yet, no changes are expected to standard workflows, and they are not useful in validation. All code compiles, and has had code formatting applied. We have performed internal validation of the output of this emulator with a dedicated ntuplizer on data and MC, and it produces values in line with what is seen in firmware testing. If additional validation checks are desired, the CICADA team can discuss providing them or performing them upon request.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

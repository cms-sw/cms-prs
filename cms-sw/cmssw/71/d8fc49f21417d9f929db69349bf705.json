The implementation is designed for the online DQM system.\r\n\r\nKey Changes and Implementation Details:\r\n\r\n- L1S DQM Monitoring Modules: Implemented in `DQM/L1ScoutingMonitor`, these modules provide an initial set of monitoring elements (MEs) for the L1S system. The set of MEs is expected to expand in future updates, which is why this PR is made as a draft. The L1ScoutingMonitor plugin is based on `DQMGlobalEDAnalyzer`, storing DQM data in PB files, following a similar approach to HLT DQM.\r\n- L1S DQM Client: Implemented in `DQM/Integration/python/clients/l1scouting_dqm_clientPB-live_cfg.py`, the client is a PB-type client that reads both PB and JSON files produced by the monitoring modules and sends the data to the DQM GUI.\r\n\r\nFor additional information, you may refer to the presentation:[dqmL1DS_L1Workshop_151024](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1410803/contributions/6162851/attachments/2948032/5181384/dqmL1DS_L1Workshop_151024.pdf) \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTo verify the implementation, the production of the PB and JSON files was successfully tested using L1S raw data files. The client was tested on a private GUI setup to ensure proper integration and functionality. The `scram build code-checks`\r\n`scram build code-format`checks were successfully performed. \r\n\r\n#### PR backport :\r\n\r\nThis PR will be backported back to CMSSW_15_0_X. \r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 78, "comments": 3, "commits": 52, "created_at": "1742397101", "deletions": 807, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "dqm-pending", "l1-pending", "core-pending", "alca-pending", "daq-pending", "geometry-pending", "operations-pending", "hlt-rejected", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "new-package-pending", "pdmv-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-rejected", "heterogeneous-pending", "tracking", "trk", "changes-dataformats"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 47627, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Level-1 Scouting DQM ", "updated_at": "1742805403", "user": "giorgettisabrina"}

This was reverted in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/41237 (see #41230) due to issues when running on multiple cores: firstly, one line of regex in the script which merges LHEs from different thrreads incorrectly caught the new lhe tag, and for the Herwig workflows the event number wasn't being properly propagated between the threads, as it needed to be passed to the LHEEventProduct. Both of these issues are now resolved, so it should be possible to re-add the reverted changes.\r\n\r\nShould be tested with https://github.com/cms-sw/cmsdist/pull/8670.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 16, "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1693232547", "deletions": 19, "labels": ["generators-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "requires-external", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_3_X", "number": 42673, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Herwig lhe matching fix (including multithreading fixes)", "updated_at": "1693278752", "user": "Dominic-Stafford"}

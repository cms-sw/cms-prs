A cmsDriver era `pf_badHcalMitigation` turns the features on\r\n\r\nTwo other features are logically part of this PR but for practical purposes were integrated in a separate request #24320:\r\n* The information about invalid H/E in reco::Photon and reco::GsfElectron objects is saved in a new flag added to the shower shape structure. The filling of the flag is enabled by default independently of the era. When reading objects reconstructed with an earlier release, the flag defaults to valid H/E.\r\n* For the implementation of the PFCluster status flag for the clusters used to mark masked Hcal areas. \r\n\r\nThe code is in principle agnostic of the kind of Hcal failure, but was tested only for HEM 15-16.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 20, "closed_at": "1535451638", "comments": 124, "commits": 25, "created_at": "1533557970", "deletions": 51, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "hlt-approved", "operations-pending", "orp-approved", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "faeb8b589663673eb1bde688b2b929bef577b852", "merged_at": "1535451638", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_3_X", "number": 24212, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 57, "state": "closed", "title": "Code for PF HEM 15-16 mitigation", "updated_at": "1535451638", "user": "gpetruc"}

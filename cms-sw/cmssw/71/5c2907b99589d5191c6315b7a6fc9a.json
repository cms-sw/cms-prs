This is leading to problems when we run on virtual machines as many of the machines share the same dummy MAC address. This has lead to noticeable GUID collisions in production. By switching to uuid_generate_random, we hope to decrease collisions.", "branch": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1533901870", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["backport-ok", "comparison-pending", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 24262, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Change how we calculate GUID", "updated_at": "1533906107", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

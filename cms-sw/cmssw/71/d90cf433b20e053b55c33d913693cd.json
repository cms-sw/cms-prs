RunBUFU.sh in EventFilter/Utilities/test also runs fine.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1574064382", "comments": 24, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1573139120", "deletions": 55, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "daq-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "1021afb7501db4f8e89b2559aef38b5fda0f4d9f", "merged_at": "1574064382", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 28359, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "(DAQ) Revert to untracked parameters and new configuration", "updated_at": "1574064382", "user": "smorovic"}

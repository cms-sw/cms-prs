The only file that really has anything to do with the modification as such is \n\nRecoTauTag/Configuration/python/boostedHPSPFTaus_cfi.py (lines 22 & 23)\n\nThe other files are part of a infrastructure that we use for our internal testing and validation (e.g. of this change), which has been extended to be able also to validate boostedTaus now. \n\nThe modification as such loosens the anti-muon discriminator requirement to be more efficient for the identification of boostedTaus. It has been verified that this increases the efficiency of the identification of boostedTaus in the relevant kinematic regimes, where two taus might be very close to each other. For non-boosted taus the expected behaviour is: \n\n1) no difference on normal taus (obviously);\n2) only small to tiny differences on boostedTaus (in the usually tested regimes for release validation);\n3) if changes occur they should only be visible in the anti-muon discriminators (loose and tight WP) and lead to an increased probability to pass the discriminator value. \n\nUsual tests have been made w/o notice of any problems. \n\nCheers,\nRoger\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1475233693", "comments": 12, "commits": 13, "created_at": "1474968164", "deletions": 8, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "c35f7160b7efe3e6d007ff6bdc0236426115fbf3", "merged_at": "1475233693", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 15996, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Modification of configuration for boostedTau creation ", "updated_at": "1487932766", "user": "roger-wolf"}

Reconstruction and identification for low pT elections would be extremely challenging, given the occupancy. \r\nIn fact, in the pp_on_AA era we had already made the customization:\r\n`e.toModify(trackerDrivenElectronSeeds, MinPt = 5.0)` \r\nSee:\r\n[trackerDrivenElectronSeeds_cfi](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/RecoParticleFlow/PFTracking/python/trackerDrivenElectronSeeds_cfi.py)\r\n\r\nThis PR extends this customization, with the same 5 GeV threshold, to lowPtGsfElectronSeeds\r\nAround 5% is saved in the reconstruction time of minimum bias events (tested on 200 events).  The AOD size is reduced by less than 0.5%.\r\n\r\nThe change was tested on wf 159.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1660632019", "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1660205147", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "a2789c19f1079e39e921ed2e4b2fc2bbb76f4a75", "merged_at": "1660632019", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 39028, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Raise pT threshold for low pT GSF electron seeds in PbPb era", "updated_at": "1660632019", "user": "mandrenguyen"}

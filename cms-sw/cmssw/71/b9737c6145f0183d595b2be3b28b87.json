I found that it ultimately occurred because the exclusion of HGCal cells from some parts of the egamma algorithms had not been updated for the new geometry and DetIds. I had previously made a simple function to do this for `GEDPhotonProducer`. I have now moved that function into `EcalTools` and propagated it to every instance I could find.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 7, "comments": 9, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1532433187", "deletions": 17, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-approved", "upgrade-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_3_X", "number": 23987, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "HGCal v9 fixes for egamma", "updated_at": "1532446351", "user": "kpedro88"}

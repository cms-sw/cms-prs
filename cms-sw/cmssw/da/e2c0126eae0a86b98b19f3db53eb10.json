This would allow the `dqmoffline` to run on GEN-SIM-RAW in Run-3 scenarios with GEMs included. Previously, `valEmtfStage2Digis` crashed because it could not find `simMuonGEMPadDigiClusters`. That is expected. A solution is provided where the GEM trigger primitive producers are run on unpacked GEM digis in GEN-SIM-RAW. Those GEM TP producers have prefixes ```valMuon```. `valMuonGEMPadDigiClusters` may be replaced with `emtfStage2Digis` once the EMTF unpacker has been updated for GEM TPs in data and the collection is available in the event.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles. \r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nBackport of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/33694 requested by @silviodonato \r\n\r\nBefore submitting your pull requests, make sure you followed this checklist:\r\n- verify that the PR is really intended for the chosen branch\r\n- verify that changes follow [CMS Naming, Coding, And Style Rules](http://cms-sw.github.io/cms_coding_rules.html)\r\n- verify that the PR passes the basic test procedure suggested in the [CMSSW PR instructions](https://cms-sw.github.io/PRWorkflow.html)\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1621437274", "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1621352358", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "a9cad702322c41b76bfcc197ef359c92ae182456", "merged_at": "1621437274", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 33772, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix valEmtfStage2Digis for unpacked GEM clusters in GEN-SIM-RAW [11_3_X]", "updated_at": "1621437274", "user": "dildick"}

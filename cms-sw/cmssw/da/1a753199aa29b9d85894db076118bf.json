This is internal only and will have no effect.\r\n- As requested, materials such as Cu, Sensi are now prefixed with tkLayout_ (and mentioned in tracker.xml only).\r\n- Geometry/CMSCommonData/python/cmsExtendedGeometry2023D5XML_cfi.py and Geometry/CMSCommonData/python/cmsExtendedGeometry2023D6XML_cfi.py need to be updated with the paths to the XMLs in TiltedTracker4026 and TiltedTracker4025 respectively. This was done locally for testing purposes, but not included in this PR.\r\n\r\nA run with 1111 is obtained with both these geometries (though the additional FPIX disk is expected to require adaptations).\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 22, "closed_at": "1480933173", "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1480930252", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "geometry-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 16857, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Added XML descriptions of Phase II Tracker", "updated_at": "1480933440", "user": "ghugo83"}

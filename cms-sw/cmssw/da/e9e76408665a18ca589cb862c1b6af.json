One problem was that\r\nsome VFE ECal volumes had their names switched around in DD4hep compared to the old DD. This PR fixes that mix-up. The number of physical volumes for Run 3 in old DD is 21339. Before this PR, DD4hep produced 21391 volumes. With this PR, this number goes down to 21354. There are still more fixes required to get to an exact match, but this PR provides a first step and provides a starting point for other developers to make more fixes.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe numbers of  \"ECVFE\" and \"EVFE\" physical volumes from debugging messages were checked before and after this PR using these two test scripts:\r\n```\r\nGeometry/EcalCommonData/test/python/dumpECDDD_cfg.py\r\nGeometry/EcalCommonData/test/python/dumpECDD4Hep_cfg.py\r\n```\r\nBefore this PR, the numbers did not match, but after this PR, there was an exact match for these volumes between old DD and DD4hep.\r\n\r\nNo backport is planned.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1611273621", "comments": 12, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1611180218", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["bug-fix", "code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved", "urgent"], "merge_commit_sha": "b1ff7a83d2c757a85c5be8847597bdd1215e095f", "merged_at": "1611273621", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 32702, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "[DD4hep] Fix switched names of ECal volumes, first step", "updated_at": "1611273621", "user": "cvuosalo"}

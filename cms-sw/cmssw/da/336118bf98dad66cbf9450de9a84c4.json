However I thought it would be useful to have a PR showing what E/gamma is considering doing.\r\n\r\nThis PR would disable the high pt trained regression which is used above 300 GeV for electrons and photons except when the electron or photon has a saturated crystals. Instead it would use the low pt trained regression. This will make the energy of high pt electron/photons easier to understand while also improving the behavior on fakes. The main benfit of the high pt regression is for staturated objects so the code still falls back to that in that case.\r\n\r\nThis is a change E/gamma wants regardless of what is ultimately decided for fixing the jetMET issue. Hopefully this will also fix the jet met issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1507904191", "comments": 51, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1507288305", "deletions": 30, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "87fc33afe67fdd89d0bb11af7ff186a21fe4d9a4", "merged_at": "1507904191", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_4_X", "number": 20771, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Disabling high pt trained regression except for saturated E/gammas", "updated_at": "1507904191", "user": "Sam-Harper"}

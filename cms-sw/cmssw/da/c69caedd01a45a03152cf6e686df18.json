It continues the work of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/47175 and https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/47280 by replacing the never-used \"PassID\" in `ProcessConfiguration` with the `HardwareResourcesDescription` that is filled by `ResourceInformation` service.\r\n\r\nThe storage `ProcessConfiguration` doesn't technically change, as the \"Pass ID\" was stored as a string, and the `HardwareResourcesDescription` is serialized manually as a string. Empty string de-serializing as an empty `HardwareResourcesDescription`, and an empty `HardwareResourcesDescription` serializing as an empty string should guarantee backwards and forwards compatibility (even if the latter is not formally supported, but just in case future Run3 MC production would need it), also for purposes of `ProcessHistory` and its ID.\r\n\r\nThe next PR in this series will improve the printouts of `edmProvDump`.\r\n\r\nResolves https://github.com/cms-sw/framework-team/issues/1185\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nFramework unit tests pass\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

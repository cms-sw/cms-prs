It has been tested with runTheMatrix (logs are in (1,2,3,4,5)). Also it has been tested with 2016 workflow since previously Run2 tests caused failure (log is in (6)) Additionally it has been tested privately to check if the sig. and bkg. efficiency correspond to the ones I got when testing during the training phase. Comparison is in (7). Essentially I ran testElectronMVARun3 and calculated sig and bkg efficiency in every region. Now, as you can see, testing with testElectronMVARun3 gave slightly better performance (higher sig and lower bkg eff) then test during the training phase. This is because I ran testElectronMVARun3 on a dataset which also partially includes the one which I used for training. This is because during the training phase I made random test/train splitting and did not save the test dataset. This is why I do not have completely unbiased testing sample  when I use testElectronMVARun3. However, when we take into account the fact that part of this dataset was used for training, the results are expected.

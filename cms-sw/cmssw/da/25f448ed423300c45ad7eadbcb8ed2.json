It allows storing the L1 and P2GT objects and also adds some gen collections used for Phase-2 Object and Menu studies.\r\n\r\nThis nano flavour is added to `autoNANO` as `@Phase2L1DPG` and also two upgrade workflows are implemented to test/run this nano after the full `DigiTrigger` chain after the complete L1: \r\n* `.781` - produces NANO in addition to FEVTDEBUG\r\n* `.782` - produces only NANO\r\nI also added the `Phase2L1DPGwithGen` flavour which includes the Gen and some RECO tables used in the MenuTools of the L1 DPG which are normally contained in the MINIAOD.\r\n\r\nThus these wfs can be used for testing Phase-2 L1 PRs in future @aloeliger @slaurila @RobertJWard @jngadiub.\r\n\r\nSome more documentation is in the `DPGAnalysis/Phase2L1TNanoAOD/README.md`.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested with the workflows `29634.781` and `29634.782` and manually with `cmsDriver.py -s NANO:@Phase2L1DPG` on 15X TTbar relvals.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 11, "comments": 25, "commits": 10, "created_at": "1737709221", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["l1-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-approved", "xpog-pending", "allow-artlbv"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 47178, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Custom Phase-2 L1 Trigger NanoAOD", "updated_at": "1739892096", "user": "artlbv"}

It has been rebased to work on the latest IB for the CMSSW_12_1_X series. This forward port was requested by @qliphy.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nAfter rebasing I checked that the code compiled both without and with running `git-cms-checkdeps -a`. I also re-ran `cmsRun DataFormats/L1TrackTrigger/test/testDataFormatsTTTrackTrackWord_cfg.py` to make sure that the new code still returned the expected output.\r\n\r\n@tomalin", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 8, "closed_at": "1630452988", "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1629741414", "deletions": 32, "labels": ["l1-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "upgrade-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "c7d4a312e7f9c5e71c1c0bc3e24e024de687a8a8", "merged_at": "1630452988", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "number": 34988, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Updates to the TTTrack/TTTrack_TrackWord DataFormats", "updated_at": "1630452989", "user": "aperloff"}

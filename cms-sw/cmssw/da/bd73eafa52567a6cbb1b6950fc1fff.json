This is mostly seen in NANOAOD production jobs that read run products at BeginRun, but also appears in the framework `TestFWCoreFrameworkGlobalStreamOne` unit test.  See #49151 for details.\r\n\r\nThis PR disables UBSAN checks for the problematic routines.  While `unreachable program point` usually means some undefined behavior that the optimizer is trying to take advantage of, no UB has been found.  Selective disabling of the UBSAN checks also failed to work around the problem, so this PR completely disables UBSAN for the routines in question.\r\n\r\nResolves #49151\r\nResolves https://github.com/cms-sw/framework-team/issues/1610\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCompiles, verified to fix the `TestFWCoreFrameworkGlobalStreamOne` unit test.

Added a possibility to configure puppi vs puppiNoLeptons in CITKPFIsolationSumProducerForPUPPI which should used in case the weights are taken from packedCandidate. In addition some renaming for puppi photon isolation in miniAOD(minor)\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 641, "closed_at": "1472295645", "comments": 72, "commits": 288, "created_at": "1471689055", "deletions": 48436, "labels": ["alca-pending", "analysis-pending", "comparison-pending", "db-pending", "dqm-pending", "l1-pending", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-rejected", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 15528, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 11, "state": "closed", "title": "Puppi isolation electrons miniaod", "updated_at": "1472295645", "user": "ishvetso"}

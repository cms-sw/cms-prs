This product is not available in RECO, but only in RAW data tier.\n\nWith this PR, the AlCaReco is run in the reco sequence, so that the collection is available in the input file.\n\nAs a side note, the RelVal were not failing because the HLT menu in use either did not contain `HLT_IsoTrk*` paths, or no events passed that selection. As a consequence, the trigger bit filter was exiting without any events.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1437281354", "comments": 15, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1435849498", "deletions": 22, "labels": ["comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "d946ec42a8169d44fd5afaa5f238688d8150eaa1", "merged_at": "1437281354", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 10024, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add HcalCalIsoTrk AlCaReco in the correct RelVal steps", "updated_at": "1437281354", "user": "diguida"}

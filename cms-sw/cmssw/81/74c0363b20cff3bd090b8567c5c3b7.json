This issue has been discussed [here](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1360959/contributions/5748554/attachments/2779212/4843756/Hgg_working_24_01_11.pdf) and [here](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1360900/contributions/5794311/attachments/2794722/4874815/240206_H4lrun3.pdf#page=16).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n* The usage of the available `GenDressedLeptons` is out of question because that collection would require too many modifications, with unknown impact on the users.\r\n* The approach proposed here can be used by all analyses and it is not analysis/PAG specific.\r\n* All the other collections are not modified (tested vs `v12` and `v13` `nanoAOD`). A more detailed comparison is done using `GluGluHtoGG_M-125_TuneCP5_13p6TeV_amcatnloFXFX-pythia8/Run3Summer22EEMiniAODv4-130X_mcRun3_2022_realistic_postEE_v6-v2/MINIAODSIM` and the dump of the collections in the current `nanoAOD` can be found [here](https://atarabin.web.cern.ch/atarabin/nano/nano_size_fullNano_rightCMSSW_BIG_OLD.html) to be compared with the one obtained with this code, that can be found [here](https://atarabin.web.cern.ch/atarabin/nano/nano_size_fullNano_rightCMSSW_BIG_NEW.html).", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 0, "closed_at": "1712251307", "comments": 29, "commits": 0, "created_at": "1710835015", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "dqm-pending", "l1-pending", "hlt-pending", "core-pending", "analysis-pending", "alca-pending", "daq-pending", "db-pending", "generators-pending", "geometry-pending", "operations-pending", "visualization-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-rejected", "xpog-pending", "heterogeneous-pending", "hcal", "tracking", "trk", "ml-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 44461, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 7, "state": "closed", "title": "Computation of Isolation for GenParticles collection", "updated_at": "1712251307", "user": "bonanomi"}

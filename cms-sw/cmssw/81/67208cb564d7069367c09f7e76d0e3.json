In the process, I cleaned up some of the HCAL-related premixing code, reducing duplication and replacing magic numbers with consts in the Traits classes. QIE10 has an 8 bit ADC, as opposed to the 7 bit ADC in QIE8, which is reflected in the `PreMixBits` value in `HcalQIE10Traits`.\n\nMany thanks to @mdhildreth for helping me test the implementation. The fC spectrum for both standard mixing (blue) and premixing with QIE10 digis (red) is shown below, displaying good agreement.\n\n![fC_standard_vs_premix_good.png](http://www.kjplanet.com/pr/fC_standard_vs_premix_good.png)\n\nTypically I have backported QIE10 features to 80X, but this is a larger change and I don't foresee any need to premix QIE10 digis in 80X, so I do not plan to backport this.\n\nOnce this PR is merged, QIE10 will be nearly feature-complete (just missing the packer, which will come separately).\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 25, "closed_at": "1462889475", "comments": 9, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1462803942", "deletions": 271, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "932be0b42f776afc296ce61ec0e2766b0978465a", "merged_at": "1462889475", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 14418, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "Premixing for QIE10", "updated_at": "1462889475", "user": "kpedro88"}

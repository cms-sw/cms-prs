There are two\r\n> different phases in the framework as a lumi is ending. There is the\r\n> 'global end lumi' phase and the 'write lumi' phase. The 'write lumi'\r\n> phase is only seen by the OutputModules and is when they \"write the\r\n> lumi to output'. So the change in #21652 deletes some histograms at\r\n> 'end of global end lumi' which is before 'write lumi' gets called.\r\n> Therefore if the deleted histograms were supposed to be saved to the\r\n> file, they would be missing.\r\n\r\nA workaround for the issue is to let the `DQMStore` delete the\r\nno-longer-needed lumi-based histograms in the \"pre global begin lumi\"\r\ntransition instead of the \"post global end lumi\".", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1513813003", "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1513785419", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_0_X", "number": 21752, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Workaround for #21749.", "updated_at": "1513813003", "user": "fwyzard"}

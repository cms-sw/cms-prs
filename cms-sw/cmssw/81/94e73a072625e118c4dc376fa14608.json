This turns on the new L1 emulation for 2015, but leaves a legacy global L1 menu in place.  Turning on this new L1 menu before the HLT does likewise breaks the standard work flows.  This PR will be superseded by one which turns on L1 and HLT new menus simultaneously.  Note that #5529 will be needed (to provide the new L1 menu as XML file).   I included this here to get Jenkins to work checking all but the last bit about menus.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_2_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1412666138", "comments": 4, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1411672137", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "new-package-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-rejected"], "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_2_X", "number": 5574, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "L1t post ls1 customs initial push", "updated_at": "1445195610", "user": "mulhearn"}

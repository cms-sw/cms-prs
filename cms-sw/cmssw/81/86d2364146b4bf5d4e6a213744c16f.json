That allows us reusing the same RECO geometry configuration rather then its DD4hep duplication\r\n* update geometry dictionaries for all 2021 and 2026 scenarios to allow selecting a dd4hep Era for Tracker\r\n* regenerate all 2021 and 2026 scenarios\r\n* simplify test configuration based on an dd4hep Era\r\n* first step in fixing tracker numbering builder: specialisation where needed, check level to escape loops, fix configuration\r\n\r\nThe test fails in `CmsTrackerDebugNavigator` due to missing `GeometricDetExtras` (noted with a FIXME in the code).\r\n\r\n@vargasa and @ghugo83 - FYI\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with a description of the feature proposed or problem addressed, specifying:\r\n  - what changes are expected in the output if any, \r\n  - what other PRs or externals it depends upon if any,\r\n  - link to any additional material useful to provide a documentation for this PR (slides, JIRA tickets, related pull requestes, hypernews, TWiki or Indico pages)  -->\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with a description of which tests have been performed to verify the correctness of the PR, including the eventual addition of new code for testing like unit tests, test configurations, additions or updates to the runTheMatrix test workflows -->\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with any link to  -->\r\n\r\nBefore submitting your pull requests, make sure you followed this checklist:\r\n- verify that the PR is really intended for the chosen branch\r\n- verify that changes follow [CMS Naming, Coding, And Style Rules](http://cms-sw.github.io/cms_coding_rules.html)\r\n- verify that the PR passes the basic test procedure suggested in the [CMSSW PR instructions](https://cms-sw.github.io/PRWorkflow.html)\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1600780310", "comments": 113, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1600241907", "deletions": 77, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "orp-pending", "tests-approved", "urgent"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 31482, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 7, "state": "closed", "title": "[DD4hep] DDFilteredView API Enhancement and Tracker Configuration by Era", "updated_at": "1600780310", "user": "ianna"}

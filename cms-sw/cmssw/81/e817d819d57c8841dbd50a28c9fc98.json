This was tested from Clang 3.3 to Clang\n3.6 and trunk (2015 Jan 28).\n\nThis is reported upstream and few people already looking into it. Also\ncauses issue to KDE/QT people.\n\nAlso this causes machine building CMSSW with Clang to go offline in Jenkins.\nThe job continues to run on build machine, but Jenkins looses the state. Then \nJenkins assumes that machine is free and could launch another CMSSW build\njob causing more stress on machine.\n\nTested with GCC and Clang. Bypassing.\n\nSigned-off-by: David Abdurachmanov David.Abdurachmanov@cern.ch\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1422439252", "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1422439234", "deletions": 0, "labels": [], "merge_commit_sha": "be7ebe56b9e567e1a10e865c29dfd48b065217cd", "merged_at": "1422439252", "merged_by": "davidlt", "number": 7416, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "L1Trigger/CSCTrackFinder: disable optimizer on Clang", "updated_at": "1422491054", "user": "davidlt"}

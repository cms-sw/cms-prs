Note that I also had to modify DPGAnalysis/Skims/python/HighMETSkim_cff.py. In this backport the hcal noise filter stays in, as it originally was in 7_4_X. Note that 7_5_X removes the hcal noise filter from HighMETSkim altogether (which I find to be rather unexpected). Perhaps, @alkaloge who did this for 7_5_X can comment on the issue.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 13, "closed_at": "1434562692", "comments": 45, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1433192012", "deletions": 253, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "260f80565ca68b2a88de7c4294c67186c2229e13", "merged_at": "1434562692", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 9395, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "Further backport of hcal noise filters", "updated_at": "1434562692", "user": "igv4321"}

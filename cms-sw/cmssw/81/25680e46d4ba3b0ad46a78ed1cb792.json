It also modernises the class while doing so.   RECO results will change in both phase-II and Run2/3, with the later just coming from a numerical precision effect. While there is a no change policy for RECO in non-phase-II, I would argue this is exempt  as it is arguably a bug fix as it no longer needlessly casts the supercluster energy to a float and thus should go in as is\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested in HLT TDR setup. \r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\nbackport of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/32901\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "changed_files": 13, "closed_at": "1614337014", "comments": 18, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1614067345", "deletions": 509, "labels": ["alca-approved", "backport-ok", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "hlt-approved", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "9ceba500e4e2c1648725c27a933f5f8184a73dca", "merged_at": "1614337014", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 32968, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 6, "state": "closed", "title": "Adding HGCAL SuperCluster Regressions : 111X", "updated_at": "1614337014", "user": "Sam-Harper"}

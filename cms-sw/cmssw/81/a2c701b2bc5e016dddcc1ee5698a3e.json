The code automatically reads these channels once a new emap is loaded. \r\n\r\nThe code only extends the histogram booking for additional EM channels, and excludes these channels from being filled in the sums. Hence, the only change will be in the addition of the 6 _EM_ channels to the DQM w/o modifying the content of all the rest (including sums).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nValidated with `CMSSW_15_0_9_patch3` with replacing the offline `HcalElectronicsMap_v10.0_offline` with new `emap_2025_full.txt` \r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR needs to be backported to 15_0_X for July _NeNe_ collisions \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 4, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1751760939", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 48487, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "add DQM plots for new CMS-FSC detector", "updated_at": "1751776806", "user": "michael-pitt"}

A squeezed version of the output specially meant for these tests is added, and reference files are built for scenario D50. <s>The second commit proposes these files in ```data``` directories, and **SHOULD NOT BE INTEGRATED AS IT IS**, since the files are too large to be stored in CMSSW. This is just for test and demonstration, separate data packages should be added in case.</s>\r\n\r\nAnyway, before doing that, I would like to discuss with @smuzaffar @ianna @cvuosalo @silviodonato a possible alternative: create a single package ```Geometry/TestReference``` under cms-data where to store all the possible test references, avoiding a multiplication of packages with 1 or very few files.\r\n\r\nThe new package ```Geometry/TestReference``` is added, and an external cms-data package is filled with reference data files.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n```scram b runtests``` runs and give no error in local tests", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 18, "closed_at": "1590732250", "comments": 145, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1589463496", "deletions": 35, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "orp-approved", "requires-external", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "d2f8af9f1e499698f61719be557fc8c8e669d825", "merged_at": "1590732250", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 29841, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 11, "state": "closed", "title": "MTD geometry: unit tests", "updated_at": "1590732250", "user": "fabiocos"}

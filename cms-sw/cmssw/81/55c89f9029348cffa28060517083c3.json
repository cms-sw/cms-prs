The AllocMonitors doing per-thread accounting did that for \"present actual\" already\r\nhttps://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/5b4897d1e7dddc68550a09ff9f1d49a991e2eee2/PerfTools/AllocMonitor/plugins/ThreadAllocInfo.h#L30-L32\r\n\r\nIn principle the \"max actual\" could have been kept as unsigned, but it is being compared to \"present actual\" and I felt things would be simplest to understand if it would be changed accordingly.\r\n\r\nResolves https://github.com/cms-sw/framework-team/issues/1848\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1770054160", "deletions": 24, "labels": ["core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_1_X", "number": 50002, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Use signed integer for \"present actual\"  and \"max actual\" in AllocMonitors", "updated_at": "1770067518", "user": "makortel"}

It works by retrieving the vector of PseudoTrap parameters from the DDFilteredView without creating a DD4Hep shape object.\r\n\r\nRecent and future geometries do not use PseudoTraps, so it is expected that it will be possible to drop support for it completely once all maps in production are updated to a recent geometry at some point in the future.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nChecked for proper construction of the 2T geometry with DD4Hep against DDD, and regression-tested all maps in production against reference values.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1589046210", "comments": 15, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1588946169", "deletions": 18, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "b051dab0c7fc2f7435322c565a971cd94207ba69", "merged_at": "1589046210", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 29781, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 7, "state": "closed", "title": "Handle PseudoTraps in DD4hep MF geometry builder", "updated_at": "1589046211", "user": "namapane"}

In this case, this is leading to compilation errors in the gcc13 IBs where nvcc does not support all the intrinsic builtins used by gcc13.  Details in #44583.\r\n\r\nThis PR simply moves some DataRecord includes to a narrower scope where nvcc won't be exposed.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCompiles with gcc13.

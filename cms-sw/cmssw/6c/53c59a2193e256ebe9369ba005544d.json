Tracking was already working, but\nthe configuration for primary vertices and beamspot\ncalculation had to be tuned to properly work also in the\ncase in which Pixels are out of data taking. The code has\nbeen successfully tested on Run 269207.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1462948096", "comments": 25, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1461074913", "deletions": 51, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "8a0105f63087b4d91a02ff256edfaef9aa778bdc", "merged_at": "1462948096", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 14150, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Enable OfflinePV and Beamspot in trackingLowPU era", "updated_at": "1462948096", "user": "rovere"}

Besides some overall code modernization, this PR partially migrates the `EGEnergyCorrector` to ESGetTokens. It will be followed up with another PR to complete the migration, but I think it's better to do it step-by-step to keep the amount of changes to review at a reasonable size.\r\n\r\nSince I noticed that the EGEnergyCorrector is not used for electrons anymore, the functions in this class that support electrons were removed. Electrons seem to exclusively use the newer regression modifiers.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCMSSW compiles and local matrix tests pass.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nNo backport intended.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1608015536", "comments": 16, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1607462318", "deletions": 638, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "332ee929def44139c1ffc396b8deb3c60be38b2b", "merged_at": "1608015536", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 32424, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "Partially migrate EGEnergyCorrector to ESGetTokens and remove support for electrons", "updated_at": "1608015536", "user": "guitargeek"}

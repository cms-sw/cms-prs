In particular, it introduces the `ticl_barrel` process modifier with which one can run CLUE in ECAL and HCAL (HO not included), also at HLT,  and the corresponding associators and validation chain.\r\n\r\nWith this PR also the first workflows for TICL-barrel are introduced. These workflows run the modules mentioned above at `step2` and `step3`, and with the HARVESTING one can produce the DQM plots for the LayerClusters in the barrel calorimeters.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nTested on wfs `29694.203`, `29634.0` (these two with and without `ticl_barrel` process modifier) and `29753.209` (introduced by this PR).\r\n\r\n@felicepantaleo @rovere @amecca ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 120, "comments": 70, "commits": 9, "created_at": "1744548059", "deletions": 285, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "hlt-pending", "generators-pending", "operations-pending", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-pending", "changes-dataformats", "allow-brusale"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 47859, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 48, "state": "open", "title": "TICL-barrel: run CLUE in the barrel calorimeters and first workflows", "updated_at": "1750779920", "user": "brusale"}

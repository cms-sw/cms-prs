Other very minor optimizations were also made to this class.\nThis pull request also modifies six modules to use the new TrackerHitAssociator interface so that all products read by the TrackerHitAssociator will be read by getByToken, and therefore registered with the consumes interface.  These modules include all five such modules that are known to be used in the relvals.\nNote that the current interface to  TrackerHitAssociator was left unchanged because many other modules still use it, although comments were added indicating that it is deprecated.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 14, "closed_at": "1428512375", "comments": 20, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1427991307", "deletions": 51, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "34a574720c95ec8418b8a12587a3af7690cb61d7", "merged_at": "1428512375", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 8647, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Consumes interface for TrackerHitAssociator ", "updated_at": "1429783109", "user": "wmtan"}

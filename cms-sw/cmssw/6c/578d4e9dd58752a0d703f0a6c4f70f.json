However, it is not the case and the actual Higgs mass in these samples is now 125 GeV with pythia 8. It had been assumed the photon scale was rather off due to old regressions, but it was really the gen settings.\n\nAfter finding this out we rather quickly traced down the problem to an improperly calculated shower shape (sigmaIetaIphi needs to be normalized by sigmaIetaIeta*sigmaIphiIphi for the regressions).\n\n@matteosan1 will upload higher-stats validation tomorrow.\n\n@gpetruc @bendavid \n\n(red is fixed regressions, blue is original energy, before faulty regressions)\n<img width=\"696\" alt=\"screen shot 2015-09-21 at 22 42 20\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1068089/10006608/d62f3bf4-60be-11e5-96bd-3ebc9e7914b5.png\">\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_12_patchX", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1443516289", "comments": 16, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1442866498", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-started"], "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_12_patchX", "number": 11403, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix sigmaIetaIphi for photon regression", "updated_at": "1443516289", "user": "lgray"}

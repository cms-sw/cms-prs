That was fixed, but the corresponding definition in the source file was also dropped by git, now causing numerous link errors in ROOT6 IB CMSSW_7_1_ROOT6_X_2014-03-12-1400.  This pull request adds the missing chunk to the source file, thereby fixing most, if not all, of the link errors.\nPlease merge immediately.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_ROOT6_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1394652720", "comments": 0, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1394652592", "deletions": 0, "labels": [], "merge_commit_sha": "92a1215b62152ad807f4e0501bc51d3fe622909e", "merged_at": "1394652720", "merged_by": "davidlt", "number": 2830, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix another git merge error", "updated_at": "1394658875", "user": "wmtan"}

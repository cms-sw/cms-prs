This PR finally removes the option to run on single pads (which was the normal way since CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC).\r\n* Second major part of the pull request is a working version of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/31401, with the intent of making the CSC trigger configuration easier to understand. All psets for ALCT, CLCT, TMB, MPC and CCLUT are put in `python/params` rather than directly in `cscTriggerPrimitiveDigis_cfi`, reducing the main configuration to less than 100 lines. Thus `params/` contains\r\n```\r\npython/params/\r\n* alctParams_cfi\r\n* clctParams_cfi\r\n* tmbParams_cfi\r\n* auxiliaryParams_cfi\r\n* cclutParams_cfi\r\n* __init__.py\r\n```\r\n* `SLHC` was renamed to `Phase2` everwhere\r\n* `alctClctOffset_` was made a constant, defined in CSCConstants.h\r\n* `use_run3_patterns_` and `use_comparator_codes_` were merged into `runCCLUT_` (because we will not run the Run-3 patterns without CCLUT)\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles. Rebase from #31460 which was stuck in failing `code-checks`.  Performance plots can be found in the #31460 conversation.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nFYI @tahuang1991 ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 36, "closed_at": "1606206559", "comments": 82, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1601471413", "deletions": 804, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "0c94a0b3f16a50907401305f27196bc9f06dddaf", "merged_at": "1606206559", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 31631, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": " Remove option to run on single GEM pads; Simplify CSC trigger configuration", "updated_at": "1606206559", "user": "dildick"}

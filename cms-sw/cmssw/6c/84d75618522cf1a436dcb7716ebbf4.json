CMSSW software needs to be modified to handle that. Following \nhttps://hypernews.cern.ch/HyperNews/CMS/get/recoDevelopment/1302.html\nI am making changes to different packages, here JET/MET. I am using the  events/run/lumi types defined in   DataFormats/Provenance/interface/RunLumiEventNumber.h . There is an issue with fastjet that needs special treatment (not for this PR). Updates are generally trivial and there should be no any visible effects of them (except for the rare event numbers with > 32 bits).  \n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_3_X", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": "1415252786", "comments": 11, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1415120537", "deletions": 17, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "cf2b5a58dd212d1b29a43da523bbd57225433e08", "merged_at": "1415252786", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_3_X", "number": 6205, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "Update types of event/run/lumi in Jet/MET", "updated_at": "1415252786", "user": "StoyanStoynev"}

This is extremely intrusive and breaks encapsulation.\n\nThis does not work anymore with new libstdc++ libraries, because foward\ndelcaration of struct is implicitly private and then implementation is\nunder explicit private clause. Redefining 'private' only change one of\nthem thus creating compile-time errors in sstream.\n\nDetails in PR65899 (GCC BZ). It's WONTFIX.\n\nSuch cleanups are required for GCC 5 and above.\n\nSigned-off-by: David Abdurachmanov David.Abdurachmanov@cern.ch\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1445261824", "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1445249648", "deletions": 379, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "81107a02b274c50f27ccd77521a91441761785ab", "merged_at": "1445261824", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 11955, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "PerfTools/Callgrind: remove intrusive macros breaking libstdc++", "updated_at": "1445263894", "user": "davidlt"}

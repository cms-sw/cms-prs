This could be added in the framework, but I haven't had time to do that so far. It will be considered for a later development item, if there are motivating use cases. (The `one` analyzer module is intended to facilitate rapid prototyping by end users who want ML inference results for their analysis. For more complicated cases, it's still probably best to use `SonicEDProducer` for inference and a separate `one` analyzer just to write the ROOT files.)\r\n\r\nSome common operations are extracted into utility functions and a common base class for modules that use ExternalWork. (The common base class re-introduces some template dependent scope issues, but these are contained within SonicCore, and should not affect downstream implementation.) Documentation and tests are updated accordingly.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nUnit tests pass.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 16, "closed_at": "1601037266", "comments": 34, "commits": 10, "created_at": "1600799981", "deletions": 48, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "heterogeneous-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "f0042934545a033bb2f3fb98625a133d95c15942", "merged_at": "1601037266", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 31546, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "Add more SONIC module types", "updated_at": "1601037266", "user": "kpedro88"}

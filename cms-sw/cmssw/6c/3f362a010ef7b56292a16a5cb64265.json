This could be done later as a separate PR if someone decided it was worth the effort.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis is only used in a unit test and that test passes.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1664854594", "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1664464487", "deletions": 64, "labels": ["dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "bd081e0c71d3f016ad53b8b07736f14f09d9f4dc", "merged_at": "1664854594", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_6_X", "number": 39541, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Migrate DummyReadDQMStore from legacy to one type", "updated_at": "1664854594", "user": "wddgit"}

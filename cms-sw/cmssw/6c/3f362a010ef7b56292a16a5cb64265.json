This could be done later as a separate PR if someone decided it was worth the effort.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis is only used in a unit test and that test passes.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 6, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1664464487", "deletions": 64, "labels": ["dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_6_X", "number": 39541, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Migrate DummyReadDQMStore from legacy to one type", "updated_at": "1664831285", "user": "wddgit"}

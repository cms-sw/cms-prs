Number 2 was not used since Run 1 and got removed in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/28429. Number 1, the `GEDGsfElectronProducer`, undergoes a similar treatment than 3 and 4 in this PR: since it extends very little on the base class, the functionality just got moved into free functions that will be used by the base producer if a configuration flag is set. Furthermore, the old `GEDGsfElectronProducer` produced an additional `ValueMap` product, and this PR factorizes this out into a new `GEDGsfElectronValueMapProducer`, improving the modularity of the reconstruction.\r\n\r\nNow, inheritance is finally not used anymore as a method for configuration in the *EgammaElectronProducers* plugins, which makes the code easier to understand. That also allows to merge the `.h` and `.cc` files of the former base producer.\r\n\r\n**Edit:** during the review it was decided to rename the surviving `GsfElectronBaseProducer` producer to `GsfElectronProducer` because it is not intended to be used as a base class anymore.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCMSSW compiles.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nNo backport intended.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 14, "closed_at": "1587098196", "comments": 49, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1585151417", "deletions": 440, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "d252e7b8bb88701735687eeaa299f9dd4b6e4930", "merged_at": "1587098196", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 29303, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 8, "state": "closed", "title": "Removing GEDGsfElectronProducer - No inheriting electron producers anymore", "updated_at": "1587098196", "user": "guitargeek"}

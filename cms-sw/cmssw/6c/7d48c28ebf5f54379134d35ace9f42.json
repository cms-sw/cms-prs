There are a number of small changes related to using pat::Jets instead of reco::PFJets, and also generalized the input of PFCandidate to simply Candidate into the jet software to allow for pat::PackedCandidates. \n\nTests with the matrix worked for \"-l limited\" and \"-l 1341.0\". Also checked \"scram b runtests\" and that was also successful. \n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": "1423057665", "comments": 19, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1422641143", "deletions": 9, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "5c124717d1446b887249bb9b5e7ac80f09b15fc4", "merged_at": "1423057665", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 7482, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Run jet reco properly on miniAOD", "updated_at": "1429721100", "user": "rappoccio"}

They are not used in sample production, and there are currently no other known uses. This is a resolution to the issue:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/35243\r\n\r\nOne spurious reference to the Famos producers is also made in  \r\nFastSimulation/ForwardDetectors/test/CastorTowerProducerTest_cfg.py\r\n\r\nThis does not seem to be usable anymore and the authors of the code left the experiment long ago, and so was also removed. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nonly unused code is removed, so no changes are \"theoretically\" possible. A standard recipe from runTheMatrix, 135.1, was tested locally without any apparent issue. \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 8, "comments": 8, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1632210104", "deletions": 530, "labels": ["core-pending", "fastsim-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "number": 35352, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "FastSim removal of unused package FastSimulation/EventProducer", "updated_at": "1632229969", "user": "sbein"}

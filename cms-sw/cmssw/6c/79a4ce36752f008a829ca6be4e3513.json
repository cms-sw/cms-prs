This is now modified so that each process must transition through each lumisection starting from one first seen in lock file in BU ramdisk.\n- correponding changes in DAQ (streamer) output module, and DQMHIstogram, L1/HLT rates stream producers to output metadata json for empty lumisections\n- avoid casting -1 to uint32 in Trigger JSON module, which converts it in the valid range of the checksum (-1 is intended as true negative in JSON to signal that checksumming is disabled in particular cases)\n- added \"maxBufferedFiles\" parameter which limits the number of currently open files (useful in case of more than two input buffers used)\n- exception thrown when \"_\" (underscore) is used as stream name because this breaks file naming convention in DAQ (and breaks output merging by hltd)\n- updated fake BU code with latest json format used by DAQ BU application\n- removed old unused test mode code in input source and DaqDirector\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 12, "closed_at": "1439955689", "comments": 32, "commits": 18, "created_at": "1439584127", "deletions": 231, "labels": ["comparison-available", "daq-approved", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "hlt-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "706cd3e74e7e5118f5120dab782cbcc2f07f075b", "merged_at": "1439955689", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 10796, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "metadata JSON files produced for empty lumisections in DAQ (74X)", "updated_at": "1447408315", "user": "smorovic"}

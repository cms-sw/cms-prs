This providing some CPU performance improvement and make code more clear.\n\nSImTrack for decay and gamma conversion is saved by default independently of position in space (before this was only inside tracker). This increasing number of SimTracks for about 15%.\n\nFlag to enable muon-nuclear interaction is propagated to all CMS Physics Lists, by default the flag is \"false\".\n\nNeutron killer disabled by default, because CMSSW has its own filters of Geant4 tracks with more tight constrains. \n\nInfo and debug printouts are cleaned up.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "changed_files": 24, "closed_at": "1397114786", "comments": 6, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1397072220", "deletions": 325, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "fully-signed", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "3e0dc57f90e9f28682afdc43deed614108f9ce8d", "merged_at": "1397114786", "merged_by": "nclopezo", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_1_0_pre6", "number": 3266, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Step/track actions updated", "updated_at": "1397118090", "user": "civanch"}

These changes were discussed with JME trigger group.   @theochatzis , @slehti \r\n\r\nYou can find a first presentation for the motivation in TSG ( @missirol , Silvia Goy Lopez ) group meeting [here](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1360493/contributions/5727426/attachments/2791084/4867384/310124_TSG_ES.pdf)\r\n\r\nBesides, you can see some plots in this [link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nk8twEIb5OcxVwfN9vKdoZN_3l9YfwJWL56N8nZnB9M/edit?usp=sharing) These plots were produced with 14_0 CMSSW version by rerunning the hlt for a muon dataset for 60k events.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe implementations were tested by running DQM steps and see that the histos are produced. Besides they were tested by using the RunTheMatrix.py -l 141.044.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nThis is not a backport. It may be backported in CMSSW_14_0_X if needed.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 17, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1710489916", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 44411, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 51, "state": "open", "title": "JME DQM implementation of Z/Gamma plus Jet monitoring for Run3  (14_1_X)", "updated_at": "1711571423", "user": "esiam"}

This simple pull request adds const to the signature of the other function, which should also have it. This makes one fewer non-const function of class ParameterSet.\nTo avoid ambiguity, the optional argument of the other function is made mandatory.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1375623502", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1375619901", "deletions": 3, "labels": [], "merge_commit_sha": "ec134c4afa714458343133521055f15b4b9a00cd", "merged_at": "1375623502", "merged_by": "ktf", "number": 230, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "getParameterSetNames is really a const function", "updated_at": "1406839380", "user": "wmtan"}

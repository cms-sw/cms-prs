It comes in the PR instead of #7810.  The modified code will need adjustments to be made in the configuration menu for the following modules:\nprocess.hltL3MuonsOIState\nprocess.hltL3MuonsOIHit\nprocess.hltL3TrajSeedIOHit\nprocess.hltL3MuonsIOHit\n\nAlso in the later menus the versions of these modules with no filters if present. Do I add the configurations as an attachment to this PR?\n\nThe configurations need to be updated as the compilation will complain during validation that \"Illegal parameters found in configuration\". I.e. we do not use the extra parameters anymore if I change the input variables in the code. If I don't change the input variables then exceptions of the type \"X should be defined as Y\" would appear. So in this case the configuration menus need to change along with the modified code.\n\nThanks,\nBenjamin\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 32, "closed_at": "1431951713", "comments": 201, "commits": 13, "created_at": "1426596735", "deletions": 932, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fastsim-approved", "fully-signed", "hlt-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "3c55852c64f30e05e1b97de5a15d4672fbc43869", "merged_at": "1431951713", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 8356, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 38, "state": "closed", "title": "L3 code update march2015", "updated_at": "1431951713", "user": "BenjaminRS"}

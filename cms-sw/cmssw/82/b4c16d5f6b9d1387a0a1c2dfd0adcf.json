HE uHTR f/w is not yet updated to send triggerable LLP bits, so HE will be masked online, and this mirrors that in the emulator. Coordinated with Ales Svetek and Sascha Savin. \r\n\r\niEta restrictions are added, to only perform the 6:1 LUT in HB at abs(iEta) = 15 and below. HF is unaffected. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested in CMSSW_12_6_X_2022-08-29-1100, passed runTheMatrix.py\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 4, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1661872046", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["l1-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_6_X", "number": 39252, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Calo L1 emulator for LLP trigger: masking the 6:1 LUT for HE", "updated_at": "1661949125", "user": "gk199"}

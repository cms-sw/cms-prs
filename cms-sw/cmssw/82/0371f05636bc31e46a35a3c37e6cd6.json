This PR superseeds #45995\r\n\r\nNaturally, db-based pulse shapes are not enabled yet (they are not in the CMS database), so no changes in validation expected at the moment.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe usual matrix tests were run. The facilities for reading/writing the database tables were privately tested. I need somebody with right permissions to take the file CondTools/Hcal/test/hcalpulsedelays.txt and copy it into a directory where it can be found by \"edmFileInPath\". Then I will be able to turn on the unit test for the database table of pulse height delays.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 60, "comments": 19, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1764931442", "deletions": 75, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "alca-pending", "db-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "hcal", "changes-dataformats"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_1_X", "number": 49556, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Infrastructure for HCAL channel-dependent pulse shapes using database configurations", "updated_at": "1766092379", "user": "igv4321"}

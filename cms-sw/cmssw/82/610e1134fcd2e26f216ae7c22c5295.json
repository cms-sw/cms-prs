Furthermore, these two classes are used only by `TSGFromL1Muon`. Therefore, for current use cases, there is no need for `L1MuonRegionProducer` to inherit from `TrackingRegionProducer`, and `L1MuonPixelTrackFitter` from `PixelFitter`. This PR suggests to remove those inheritances to ease a bit further refactoring elsewhere.\r\n\r\nTested in CMSSW_8_1_0_pre16, no changes expected in results.\r\n\r\n@rovere @VinInn ", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1478804382", "comments": 11, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1478533817", "deletions": 46, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "6a1f7f6f7e3d0960b4813b58b7f57bcf060d9b52", "merged_at": "1478804382", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 16492, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Remove inheritance in L1MuonPixelTrackFitter and L1MuonRegionProducer", "updated_at": "1478804383", "user": "makortel"}

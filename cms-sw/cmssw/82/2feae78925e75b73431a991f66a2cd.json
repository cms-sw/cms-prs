This commit adds support for such a new option\nto runTheMatrix.py so that jobs which need to query DAS simply\n\"pro-forma\" (i.e. to make sure we do exactly what woul be done in\nreal production) are not stopped by occasional outages.\n\nThe goal is not to replace DAS queries, but simply to provide a\nfallback option for the cases where we know data is there, most\nnotably IBs and pull request automated tests.\n\nSee also dmwm/DAS#4142 .\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1392205666", "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1391778369", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_7_1_0_pre5", "number": 2356, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add DAS caching option to runTheMatrix.py", "updated_at": "1467130125", "user": "ktf"}

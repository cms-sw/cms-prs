Also, we would like to introduce new keys into autoCond to support the Run 3 relvals in PR #27433. This PR is needed to support but could be merged before PR #27433.\r\n\r\nNew GT naming conventions are necessary to avoid confusion between the end of Run 3 scenario and the so-called \"upgrade2023\" scenario. The later is now referred to as \"Run4\".\r\n\r\nWe have taken this opportunity to clean up some obsolete tags for the pixel [1] and make a technical change to avoid maintaining two `SiPixelLorentzAngleRcd` payloads when the payloads are identical.\r\n\r\nThere is one change relative to the previous autoCond contents: the tracker alignment scenario has been updated for 2021 realistic scenarios for both cosmics and collisions [3, 4].\r\n\r\nAttn: @mmusich\r\n\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/110X_mcRun3_2021_design_v1/106X_upgrade2021_design_v3\r\n- Removed obsolete pixel tags [1]\r\n- Use `SiPixelLorentzAngleRcd` payload with label \"forWidth\" that has all zeros [2]\r\n\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/110X_mcRun3_2021_realistic_v1/106X_upgrade2021_realistic_v8\r\n- Removed obsolete pixel tags [1]\r\n- Use `SiPixelLorentzAngleRcd` payload with label \"forWidth\" that has all zeros [2]\r\n- Update tracker alignment scenario [3, 4]\r\n\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/110X_mcRun3_2021cosmics_realistic_deco_v1/106X_upgrade2021cosmics_realistic_deco_v3\r\n- Removed obsolete pixel tags [1]\r\n- Use `SiPixelLorentzAngleRcd` payload with label \"forWidth\" that has all zeros [2]\r\n- Update tracker alignment scenario [3, 4]\r\n\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/110X_mcRun3_2023_realistic_v1/106X_mcRun3_2023_realistic_v3\r\n- Removed obsolete pixel tags [1]\r\n- Tracker alignment scenario [3] and labeled `SiPixelLorentzAngleRcd` updated already in `106X_mcRun3_2023_realistic_v3` GT\r\n- Addition of payloads that were introduced by PR #26892 into all collisions GTs in autoCond at the time and then subsequently ignored by an era mechanism in a later revision of that PR. The payloads are added here for consistency in case during the preparation of the 2018 UL it is decided to switch back to using conditions. If this turns out to be unnecessary, these payloads will be removed in a later cleanup.\r\n\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/110X_mcRun3_2024_realistic_v1/106X_mcRun3_2024_realistic_v4\r\n- Removed obsolete pixel tags [1]\r\n- Tracker alignment scenario [3] and labeled `SiPixelLorentzAngleRcd` updated already in `106X_mcRun3_2024_realistic_v4` GT\r\n- Addition of payloads that were introduced by PR #26892\r\n\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/110X_mcRun4_realistic_Queue/106X_upgrade2023_realistic_v5 \r\n- No changes in move to 11_0_X queue; renaming only\r\n\r\n[1] https://hypernews.cern.ch/HyperNews/CMS/get/calibrations/4159/1/1.html\r\n[2] https://hypernews.cern.ch/HyperNews/CMS/get/calibrations/4168.html \r\n[3] https://indico.cern.ch/event/831067/contributions/3481130/attachments/1871760/3080376/20190701_AlCaDB_ULandRun3.pdf\r\n[4] https://hypernews.cern.ch/HyperNews/CMS/get/calibrations/4171/1.html\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n`runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos` was executed successfully.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\n\r\nThis PR should not be backported.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1562867651", "comments": 26, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1562242776", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "requires-external", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "2ded4817b2f4f01a3b3cad80b65c34aa3708a6e3", "merged_at": "1562867651", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27441, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add 11_0_X global tags for 2021 and later MC scenarios", "updated_at": "1562867652", "user": "christopheralanwest"}

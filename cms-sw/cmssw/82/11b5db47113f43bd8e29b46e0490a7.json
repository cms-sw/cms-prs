Singletons are bad for the multithreaded framework, so this pull request eliminates this singleton.  In this particular case, the data held by this singleton is not needed outside the input source, so it is relatively easy to eliminate the use of a singleton.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1376389344", "comments": 4, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1376333168", "deletions": 48, "labels": [], "merge_commit_sha": "cd56590292d4c579dffa52de50a76ab29672192d", "merged_at": "1376389344", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_0_0_pre3", "number": 288, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Remove EntryDescriptionRegistry", "updated_at": "1404637828", "user": "wmtan"}

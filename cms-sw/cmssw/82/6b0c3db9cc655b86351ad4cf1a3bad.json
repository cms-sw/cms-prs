These channels are only on the DAQ pipeline and do not contribute to trigger primitives / ZDCSums, and by extension they have no LUT payload to be loaded on-detector. Therefore, the `HcalLutMetadata` is used to cleanly avoid them while making the LUT XML. This avoidance mechanism actually generalizes for any ZDC channels: they must be in the `HcalLutMetadata` condition for a LUT to be made.\r\n\r\n **N.B.** _This only affects code that is run manually offline. This code is not used in any reconstruction workflow._\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRan offline in standard LUT production workflow and confirm that code does not crash when FSC-as-ZDC-EM channels are present in the HCAL electronics map and confirmed that the output LUT XML is unchanged for everything else after including the PR code.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nWill backport to 15_0_X\r\n\r\nATTN: @hjbossi, @abdoulline, @akhukhun", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1751271659", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["db-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 48446, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Avoid FSC Channels when Making HCAL LUT XML Payloads", "updated_at": "1751271688", "user": "JHiltbrand"}

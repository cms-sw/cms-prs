The same change has previously been made for 75X and 81X. The delay for 80X was due to ongoing discussion about hardware updates that have been put on hold until after the pPb run.\n\nI've also added digi->reco functionality for data unpacked through the new ZDC unpacker.\n\n-Chris\n\nP.S. For those following ZDC software discussions - this PR is only related to the \"old\" ZDC subdets, and does not address a future PR related to the new RPD subdet.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 16, "closed_at": "1476967147", "comments": 19, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1475779539", "deletions": 48, "labels": ["backport", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "operations-approved", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "0cce7b7143569cf10c4fcd7a59c38bfea57dd7a4", "merged_at": "1476967147", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 16128, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 5, "state": "closed", "title": "ZDC unpacker into castor, backport to 80X", "updated_at": "1476967148", "user": "cferraio"}

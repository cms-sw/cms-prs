One solution (proposed by HIN PAG in [CMSHLT-2922](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSHLT-2922)) is to use a different type of plugin ([HLTPixelActivityFilter](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/CMSSW_13_2_4/HLTrigger/special/plugins/HLTPixelActivityFilter.cc)), which is what is going to be implemented for the data-taking.\r\nThis PR proposes to fix the module `PixelCountFilter` by introducing the machinery in `CommonTools/Utils{Algos}` in order to count (and cut) on the total number of entries in a `DetSetVector`. This is implemented in c8b39085aad17dcb18d56d51ca29514253be245b.\r\nIn parallel a new filter `PixelOccupancyFilter` is introduced, which allows to filter events if at least N pixel modules have M clusters, where A <=  M <= B (N, A and B are configuration parameters). This is implemented in c8b39085aad17dcb18d56d51ca29514253be245b.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n`cmssw` compiles. Private tests were carried out with this commit https://github.com/mmusich/cmssw/commit/9d74d21abec5d7d4535273345f84ade1fd02ba3b at to test that the newly introduced filters work as expected\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

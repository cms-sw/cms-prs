This is because it was foreseen that subsequent 90X releases could be used for re-DIGI-RECO of existing GEN-SIM samples for Phase2 TDR production.\r\n\r\nIn 91X, the phase2 geometries have changed, so 90X GEN-SIM will not be reused for TDR production with 91X releases. Therefore, we can enable this setting for HCAL GEN-SIM reusability globally.\r\n\r\nattn: @bsunanda, @abdoulline", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1490366673", "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1490296046", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "731b5c43ab0a5c2272b270df5ffc1ef05c34bb77", "merged_at": "1490366673", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_1_X", "number": 18056, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "apply HCAL layer0 weight in digi step for phase2", "updated_at": "1490366673", "user": "kpedro88"}

(Concurrent lumi section processing is not very needed here). \r\n\r\nPlotting script is added to compare barycentres from Prompt Reco, End-of-Year Rereco and so-called Run-2 (Ultra)Legacy Rereco.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nPlotting script is used as a validation of the output (Ntuple) from the analyzer\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nThe PR is not a backport.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1611831598", "comments": 30, "commits": 8, "created_at": "1609824323", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "cd0fab1442a3c255e57990ac52f0a7b090925ed5", "merged_at": "1611831598", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 32601, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 16, "state": "closed", "title": "Add PixelBaryCentreAnalyzer in Alignment offline validation tool", "updated_at": "1611831598", "user": "tocheng"}

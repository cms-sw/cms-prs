The struct `ngt::MemoryCopyTraits<T>` should be specialised for the types that can be safely `memcpy`'ed.\r\n\r\nAnd is accompanied by various tests:\r\n  * Catch2 tests for the `ngt::MemoryCopyTraits`.\r\n  * Catch2 tests for the `ngt::SerialiserFactory`.\r\n  * integration tasts based on the `ngt::GenericCloner`.\r\n\r\nThe `ngt::GenericCloner` is included to demonstrate how the new functionalities can be used, and to implement various integration tests. This `EDProducer`  will clone all the event products declared in its configuration, using either the plugin-based NGT trivial serialisation, or the products' ROOT dictionaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR tests:\r\n\r\nThe new unit tests pass.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 64, "comments": 27, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1764103999", "deletions": 13, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "simulation-approved", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "new-package-pending", "code-checks-approved", "heterogeneous-pending", "tracking", "trk", "ngt"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_0_X", "number": 49475, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "open", "title": "Trivial serialisation plugin mechanism", "updated_at": "1764398526", "user": "fwyzard"}

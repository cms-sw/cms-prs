The struct `ngt::MemoryCopyTraits<T>` should be specialised for the types that can be safely `memcpy`'ed.\r\n\r\nAnd is accompanied by various tests:\r\n  * Catch2 tests for the `ngt::MemoryCopyTraits`.\r\n  * Catch2 tests for the `ngt::SerialiserFactory`.\r\n  * integration tasts based on the `ngt::GenericCloner`.\r\n\r\nThe `ngt::GenericCloner` is included to demonstrate how the new functionalities can be used, and to implement various integration tests. This `EDProducer`  will clone all the event products declared in its configuration, using either the plugin-based NGT trivial serialisation, or the products' ROOT dictionaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR tests:\r\n\r\nThe new unit tests pass.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 69, "closed_at": "1765994795", "comments": 48, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1764103999", "deletions": 14, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved", "heterogeneous-approved", "tracking", "trk", "ngt"], "merge_commit_sha": "154db9cdbd9c12bedd0d17fd14a145e370f3ad2a", "merged_at": "1765994795", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_16_0_X", "number": 49475, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 13, "state": "closed", "title": "Trivial serialisation plugin mechanism", "updated_at": "1765994796", "user": "fwyzard"}

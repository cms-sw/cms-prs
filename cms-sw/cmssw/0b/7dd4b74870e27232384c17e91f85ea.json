To fix this problem an extra protection is added to the SteppingAction class: on each step check on NaN values and kill problematic track. This may be also useful for production (no reports so far from production about such cases).\r\n\r\nCMSSteppingVerbose class is used only for debugging of problem. It is extended in order to be more informative for debugging on complicated problems.\r\n\r\nResults of normal runs should not be affected.

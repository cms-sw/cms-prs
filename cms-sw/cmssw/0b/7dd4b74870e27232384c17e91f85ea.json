To fix this problem an extra protection is added to the SteppingAction class: on each step check on NaN values and kill problematic tracks. This may be also useful for production (no reports so far from production about such cases).\r\n\r\nCMSSteppingVerbose class is used only for debugging of a problem. It is extended in order to be more informative for debugging on complicated crashes.\r\n\r\nResults of normal runs should not be affected.

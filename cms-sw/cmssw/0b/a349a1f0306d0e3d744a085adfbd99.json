The stable mesons should be produced in pairs, so this filter is used to require that the invisible particles appear in the event in multiples of 4. The filter will be used for central production of signal samples.\r\n\r\nThis PR will be backported to (at least) 9_3_X for 2017 GEN-SIM production.\r\n\r\nattn: @DryRun ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1543445482", "deletions": 0, "labels": [], "number": 25366, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Filter for semi-visible jet signal production", "updated_at": "1543445551", "user": "kpedro88"}

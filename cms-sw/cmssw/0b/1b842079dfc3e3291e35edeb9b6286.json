The removed calls\nare replaced by adding a function to the EventBase\ninterface that allows getting a product using the\nProductID. After the change we explicitly get the\nProductID from the Ref and then use the new function\nin EventBase to get the container product instead\nof getting the container product directly from the\nRef.\n\nI extended the unit tests for the Core part of this,\nbut have not tested the Fireworks part of this beyond\nchecking that it compiles (expecting the Fireworks\nexperts to test that, Matevz agreed to do that).\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 11, "closed_at": "1420671632", "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1420643590", "deletions": 8, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "visualization-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "013b7c4e1e9f7065e5e1f8e884fe82c499bc60ea", "merged_at": "1420671632", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 7065, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Remove calls to Ref::product from Fireworks", "updated_at": "1432057408", "user": "wddgit"}

I don't expect any issues with clones since by default the trigger matching is disabled. For patMuons the HLT process name is properly synchronized with the patTrigger and slimmedPatTrigger in the ConfigBuilder. It's critical to have this in the final CMSSW_10_2_X release, but it's not really needed for the release validation, since it only adds new information without touching already existing data.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 9, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1530452878", "deletions": 8, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 23728, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[muon] Enabled trigger matching and minor improvements to the matching algorithm", "updated_at": "1530516098", "user": "drkovalskyi"}

We are dropping particleFlowCluster for HGC: `recoPFClusters_particleFlowClusterHGCal` and `recoPFClusters_particleFlowClusterHGCalFromMultiCl` (two collections one from seeded by simPF, another seeded by ticl clusters) from AOD. Note that they are still kept for RECO. Also note that particleFlowCluster for ECAL, HCAL, etc are not kept for AOD, so we are just trying to do the same thing for HGCal.\r\n\r\nI also used this occasion to clean up unnecessary keep statements.\r\n\r\nFor AOD file of 200PU ttbar, I see the size reduction of about 25% after this change.\r\n\r\nThis is being done with consultation with @dpiparo .\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRan a few matrix tests.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nNot a backport.\r\n\r\n@bendavid @marksan87 @laurenhay @juska @kdlong ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1621255253", "comments": 13, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1620848516", "deletions": 7, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "862798ce061ad76bddd2ae501a17f6a4ec9c8b6a", "merged_at": "1621255253", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "number": 33717, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Cleaning up PF contents in AOD.", "updated_at": "1621255254", "user": "hatakeyamak"}

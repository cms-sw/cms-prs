This has the effect of making the plots understandable also using PU samples and a side effect of reducing the timing of that module from an average of **14s/event** to **0.2s/event** on a typical TTBar+200PU event.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, it would be worth signalling that the current main offender in a typical Relval/runTheMatrix workflow with PU is the **OuterTrackerMonitorTrackingParticles** module, with its 400s/event. I do not know if this is known or, maybe, it is some weird effect that I happened to notice.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRun on TTbar and EGun RelVal samples of 10_6_0 with 200PU\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1558895856", "comments": 14, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1558633631", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "9bc65dbc846b1d2ae1b150f0796fb3f8f129c7b3", "merged_at": "1558895856", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 26915, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "[HGCAL] Perform HGCal Calibration only on the hard scatterer event", "updated_at": "1558895856", "user": "rovere"}

By using references in the argument list, ALCTs and CLCTs that were invalid became copies of valid ones. This duplicated the ALCTs and CLCTs in the event. The bug is fixed by reverting to sending copies of objects. This is not ideal (should send const reference). I will look at some options to modernize the code.\r\n\r\n@tahuang1991 ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1517500014", "comments": 14, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1516737497", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "8a334c0b372a543de2a7943f9570622a24388047", "merged_at": "1517500013", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_1_X", "number": 21933, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Bugfix duplicate ALCT/CLCT in Run-2 configuration", "updated_at": "1517500014", "user": "dildick"}

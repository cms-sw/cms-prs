This PR extends the treatment of `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and `ROOT_INCLUDE_PATH` to `PYTHON3PATH`, which appears to fix the issue.\r\n\r\nI opened a separate PR because the issue and content is independent of the content of #40383.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe test passes with #40383.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1671587411", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["core-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "number": 40384, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Handle PYTHON3PATH as well in TestIOPoolInputNoParentDictionary", "updated_at": "1671587963", "user": "makortel"}

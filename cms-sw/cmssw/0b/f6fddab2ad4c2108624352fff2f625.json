As well, empty Y-axis labels are now simply given their corresponding bin number, to prevent empty string labels causing issues as seen before in #32250. This PR fixes the issue first spotted on this hypernews thread: https://hypernews.cern.ch/HyperNews/CMS/get/tier0-Ops/2192.html\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nAll code compiles, and produces expected plots as seen when using `runTheMatrix.py`. Using @silviodonato 's method to test the DQM merging step, this code eliminates the merging error seen.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nThis PR is a forward port to the master branch / 11_3_X of #32815. It was created by `git cherry-pick` -ing the three relevant commits on top of the current state of the master branch. This fix needs to be ported to be available in future production instances of CaloL1 DQM code.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1612546047", "comments": 20, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1612442681", "deletions": 26, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved", "urgent"], "merge_commit_sha": "f1a824a92476770df2fe6cd3ddd5101fa4af50ca", "merged_at": "1612546047", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 32816, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Calo L1 last20Mismatches Axis Fix Forward Port", "updated_at": "1612546047", "user": "aloeliger"}

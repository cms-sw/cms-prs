A full report has been gathered [here](https://indico.cern.ch/event/841678/?showDate=all&showSession=6#33-feedback-on-the-new-run-3-c).\r\nIn addition the alignment performance of the previous misalignment scenario has been checked using samples produced with the updated conditions, and a compelling reason to update it has not been found (report is available [here](https://indico.cern.ch/event/841678/?showDate=all&showSession=0#36-run-iii-studies-virtual)).\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\n\r\nThis PR is not a backport, though possibly updated GTs in 10.6.X will be requested as well for further samples production.\r\nCc:\r\n@tsusa @tvami @pieterdavid @robervalwalsh @connorpa @adewit \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1574801020", "comments": 26, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1574289178", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "bf822165b7384aef13eba44dc23aa24323f6b164", "merged_at": "1574801020", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 28441, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Update Run3 Tracker (Pixel and Strips) conditions", "updated_at": "1574801020", "user": "mmusich"}

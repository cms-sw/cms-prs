I assume they are somehow irrelevant as they pertain to combinations that are probably never run online, but nevertheless to avoid too much ad hoc handling in the test they are fixed here.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe newly added unit tests: `scram b runtests_TestDQMOnlineClients-compilation_[*]` run fine.\r\n\r\n[*] = `'pp_run'`,`'pp_run_stage1'`,`'cosmic_run'`,`'cosmic_run_stage1'`,`'hi_run'`,`'hpu_run'`,`'commissioning_run'`\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

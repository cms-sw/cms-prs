I assume they are somehow irrelevant as they pertain to combinations that are probably never run online, but nevertheless to avoid too much ad hoc handling in the test they are fixed here.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe newly added unit test: `scram b runtests_TestDQMOnlineClients-compilation` runs fine.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nNot a backport, but if desired it can be backport to CMSSW_14_0_X for data-taking purposes", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 9, "comments": 4, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1710490918", "deletions": 21, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 44412, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "open", "title": "add a python compilation unit test for DQM online clients", "updated_at": "1710501717", "user": "mmusich"}

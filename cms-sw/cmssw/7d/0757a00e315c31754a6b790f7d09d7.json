To enter the shell, use the command:\r\n```\r\nrunTheMatrix.py --interactive\r\n```\r\n I regularly find myself searching for a particular combination of geometry, release, samples, whatever in the rather complete set of samples we can generate with `runTheMatrix`. \r\nWhile everything can be (more or less easily) performed piping the output to `less`, `grep` and similar tools, I thought it would have been nice to have an interactive shell where the user can explore all the possibilities of samples and `macro` samples available through `runTheMatrix` in an interactive way.\r\nThe amount of commands implemented is rather limited but cover the use cases I needed the most.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI tried an interactive session. I'm not sure how to test this in a systematic way.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1617508378", "comments": 23, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1614948250", "deletions": 8, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "pdmv-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "87af7a1419e41fd9d6c779f6307386514efcf146", "merged_at": "1617508378", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 33082, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add interactive option to runTheMatrix", "updated_at": "1617508378", "user": "rovere"}

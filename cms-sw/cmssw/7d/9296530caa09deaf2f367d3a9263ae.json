Once these changes are in 6_2_X we can move to newer versions of the Tauola++ without breaking anything (ie Add TauSpinner).  I recommend the same procedure as 5_3_X were we built a special release for Relval and then merge into 6_2_X after the full relVal.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_6_2_X", "changed_files": 52, "closed_at": "1392750164", "comments": 12, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1390062858", "deletions": 765, "labels": ["fully-signed", "generators-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "f3a9cb3d546d6dfa589ff90ad5242374595940c8", "merged_at": "1392750164", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_6_2_X", "number": 2075, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Pull request ExternalDecay plugins to add to 6_2_X", "updated_at": "1392750164", "user": "inugent"}

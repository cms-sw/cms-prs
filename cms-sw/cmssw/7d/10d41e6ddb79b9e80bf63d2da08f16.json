In this PR the approach is implemented to enable such simulation by extension of the existing modifier pp_on_PbPb_run3. The reasons: for pp run ZDC is not used, so simulation should be performed without transport from CMS to ZDC, in contrary, in the case of PbPb run PPS is not used but ZDC is enabled. The current simulation of ZDC bring a significant CPU penalty to simulation full shower in the detector with ZDC shower library disabled. This PR provide pp simulation unchanged and ZDC simulation enabled for PbPb.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nprivate\r\n\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\nit will be backport for ZDC simulation in 13_X.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 2, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1701766795", "deletions": 8, "labels": ["simulation-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "number": 43493, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[14_0_X SIM] Added ZDC transport as an option of FullSIm for heavy ion simulation", "updated_at": "1701767147", "user": "civanch"}

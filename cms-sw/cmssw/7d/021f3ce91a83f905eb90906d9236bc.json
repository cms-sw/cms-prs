It is self-documenting with a custom help message using the `info` parameter. A few elements had to be re-implemented for this context (grabbing correct geometry, appending an arbitrary command e.g. to set hardcode condition options, dumping the state of the process because `edmConfigDump` doesn't allow command-line arguments to the config).\r\n\r\nThis new script is submitted as a separate version by request of HCAL DB experts.\r\n\r\nattn: @abdoulline, @mazarkin, @walterjr ", "branch": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1480588124", "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1480446982", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["comparison-available", "db-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "1208c79099ead5d1d2fcc3942a432ad6f2d5cc45", "merged_at": "1480588124", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "number": 16810, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "new version of dumpHcalCond_cfg", "updated_at": "1480588124", "user": "kpedro88"}

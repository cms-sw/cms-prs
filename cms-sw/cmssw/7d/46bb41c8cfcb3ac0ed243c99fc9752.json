(Verified on one event that all rechits are the same down to 5 decimal places, but there can be smaller numerical differences clearly.)\n\nSpeedup of the EcalUncalibRecHitMultiFitAlgo is just short of a factor of 3.  (~800ms -> ~280ms for pu40bx25 photon gun)\n\nThe EcalUncalibRecHitProducer has also been made a stream module.\n\n@emanueledimarco @argiro @lgray \n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_2_X", "changed_files": 12, "closed_at": "1411485107", "comments": 21, "commits": 8, "created_at": "1410886558", "deletions": 315, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "d1a9d4ac0e435982734c2c99582ed7254c811466", "merged_at": "1411485107", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_2_X", "number": 5321, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "Ecal multifit optimized", "updated_at": "1411485107", "user": "bendavid"}

It provides the missing link between the S-link frames cast into FED raw data and the digis collection already introduced since #38538, and allows future developments for the validation of the whole transmission chain.\r\n\r\nAs a way to test this unpacking, a full frame emulator is also provided along this PR. It allows the emulation of S-link, capture block, and ECON-D level payloads to be fed to the unpacker to simulate various boundary conditions. It can recast either realistic frames collected in lab/test beam, or fully \"trivial\" channels content containing the minimal information possible. Along with this emulation, a few metadata objects are introduced for future in-depth validations, when the error handling of the unpacker will be improved.\r\n\r\nVarious tests, defined along with the DPG (see e.g. [this presentation from 12.04](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1274686/contributions/5353145)) are introduced as \"unit tests\", and allow these boundary conditions checks to be performed.\r\n\r\nA few `const`-qualification of the main data formats were introduced, possibly for the thread safety of some of these tests.\r\n\r\nBeside the long development history leading to this PR, it only contains a limited (although >1) number of commits to reflect the various contributions from the experts involved (@pfs, @yulunmiao).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis PR is relatively orthogonal to all parts of the validation suite, and only a limited, but successful `runTheMatrix.py` run was performed. As mentioned above, a few unit tests are introduced along with these two components. These can be steered through the standard `scram b runtests`.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

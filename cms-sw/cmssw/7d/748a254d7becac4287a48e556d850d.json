We added a protection in the combination code to only use the Ep combination MVA at high energies when the track pT error is smaller than 10 times the track pT. It is a pretty safe cut that removes these badly measured tracks from the determination of the electron energy.\n\nReference: https://hypernews.cern.ch/HyperNews/CMS/get/physTools/3446/1/1/1/1.html\n\natt: @fcouderc @matteosan1 \n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1455687581", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1455632536", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "365f2bc42de0cf107f829395057eb5928bed2748", "merged_at": "1455687581", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 13302, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Ep protection at high energy against crazy tracks ..

It started as a desire to reduce copy-paste between RECO, DQM, and VALIDATION configurations, but I soon realized that the same approach can be used also to automatize the cluster remover configurations.\n\n~~The PR is currently marked as \"RFC\", because I'm unsure if~~\n- ~~this is the way we want to solve the two \"problems\"~~\n- ~~now is a good time do such changes~~\n  - ~~I'm mainly thinking interference with Phase2 era migration, although I'd naively think this PR would make life easier also there~~\n\nI tested all `(full workflow, trackingOnly workflow) x (Run2_2016, Run2_2016_trackingLowPU, Run2_2017, Run2_2017_trackingPhase1PU70, Run2_2017_trackingRun2, FastSim)` combinations as generated by #14540, and there should be no changes in RECO quantities. Validation (MultiTrackValidator) shows some changes because the order of input per-iteration track collections has changed in some of the combinations. In addition, the last commit 7293c47 adds plots for `duplicateMerge` tracks for `trackingLowPU` era that was inadvertently omitted before.\n\nTested in CMSSW_8_1_X_2016-05-16-2300 (rebased on top of CMSSW_8_1_X_2016-05-23-2300), no changes expected in standard workflows, except in MultiTrackValidator `*_coll` plots.\n\n@rovere @VinInn ~~Please comment soon if the approach presented here has any chance to get integrated, i.e. I could use it to add `detachedTripletStep` back and reorder the iterations for phase1 (if not, I'll do them \"manually\").~~\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 16, "closed_at": "1464184407", "comments": 30, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1463551088", "deletions": 480, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "7a63df0ac0bce91496797aec99fd9f85db6152f8", "merged_at": "1464184407", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 14544, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Unify tracking iteration configurations in RECO, DQM, and VALIDATION, and automatize cluster removal", "updated_at": "1464184408", "user": "makortel"}

Code compiles and all but one framework unit test pass.\r\n\r\nThe only known failure is `TestIOPoolInputNoParentDictionary`. When that test run it copies parts of code from CMSSW to a new build area. The problem is it doesn't copy enough code to work with this change (code in DataFormats/Common/test fails to build).\r\n\r\nresolves https://github.com/cms-sw/framework-team/issues/1296", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 72, "comments": 19, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1741372499", "deletions": 407, "labels": ["simulation-pending", "dqm-pending", "core-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-pending", "trk"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 47533, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 8, "state": "open", "title": "Compartmentalize how ProductRegistry is filled", "updated_at": "1741529186", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

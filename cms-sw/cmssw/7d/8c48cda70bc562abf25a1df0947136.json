Code compiles and all but one framework unit test pass.\r\n\r\nThe only known failure is `TestIOPoolInputNoParentDictionary`. When that test run it copies parts of code from CMSSW to a new build area. The problem is it doesn't copy enough code to work with this change (code in DataFormats/Common/test fails to build).\r\n\r\nresolves https://github.com/cms-sw/framework-team/issues/1296", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 72, "closed_at": "1741790140", "comments": 37, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1741372499", "deletions": 407, "labels": ["core-approved", "dqm-approved", "simulation-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved", "trk", "tests-manual-override"], "merge_commit_sha": "a69a71c89560598d8bed33d7a4e6abdd5f6377fe", "merged_at": "1741790140", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 47533, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 8, "state": "closed", "title": "Compartmentalize how ProductRegistry is filled", "updated_at": "1741790143", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

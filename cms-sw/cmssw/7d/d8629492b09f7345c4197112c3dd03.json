The logic was that was that the charged hadron subtraction for in-time PU isn't useful, since only a single PV is reco'd. However, it appears there are additional elements of egamma ID that come in at this stage. This PR reincludes the PF relinking with (only) the charged hadron subtraction explicitly disabled. With 1.5k events of wf 150.1, changes were observed to PF candidates of ID = 2 (electrons) and 4 (photons), but no changes to charged hadrons, neutral hadrons, or muons. For now, both the \"Tmp\" and final PF candidates are stored, so the event size will increase. Eventually the Tmp collections will be dropped, but we would like to keep both temporarily for comparisons.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1502127873", "comments": 33, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1501076518", "deletions": 9, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "3d50ec9c5c0257ef352c7a703f09e49faf310612", "merged_at": "1502127873", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_3_X", "number": 19927, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 5, "state": "closed", "title": "Add PF relinking for the HI reco sequence", "updated_at": "1502127873", "user": "mandrenguyen"}

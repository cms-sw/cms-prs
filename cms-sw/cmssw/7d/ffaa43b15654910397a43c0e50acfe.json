Remove unused plugins in EgammaHLTProducers\r\n 2. Merge the .h and .cc files of the remaining plugins and put them into the plugin directory\r\n 3. Remove the RecoEgamma/EgammaHLTAlgos package since only two classes in that package are still used at this point:\r\n    * *EgammaHLTPixelMatchElectronAlgo*: only used in EgammaHLTProducers/plugins anyway so it should just go there\r\n    *  *EgammaHLTTrackIsolation*: used not only in EgammaHLTProducers but also in DQMOffline/Trigger. As an isolation algo, it was moved to RecoEgamma/EgammaIsolationAlgos since both packages that use EgammaHLTTrackIsolation already depend on the EgammaIsolationAlgos package anyway.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCMSSW compiles and local matrix tests run.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\n\r\nNo backport intended.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 96, "closed_at": "1568054410", "comments": 36, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1567248466", "deletions": 7061, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "core-approved", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "hlt-approved", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "747a9c4ba1d8bb773153b75d8e12508b07115644", "merged_at": "1568054409", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27909, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 7, "state": "closed", "title": "Cleanup of EgammaHLTAlgos/Producers", "updated_at": "1568054410", "user": "guitargeek"}

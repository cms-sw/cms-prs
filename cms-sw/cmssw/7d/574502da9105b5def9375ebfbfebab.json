The VID / nano down stream changes will come in a seperate PR. \r\n\r\nIt overhauls the photon pf isolation to be values actually used in IDs and MVAs and at the same times adds smajor,minor, alpha 2nd momement showershape variables which are useful for OOT photons.  In the electrons, it adds the HEEP flavour of track isolation and the conversion vtx probability and some helper functions for kf nhits and chi2. \r\n\r\nThe only changes expected (other than the population of new data members) are that the selection on the miniAOD for photons is now using a different definition of charged isolation so there will be some content changes in the reducedEgamma. This is a desired feature. There will also be rare changes the reco::Photon pf photon and neutral isolation values. \r\n\r\nI'm running the matrix tests now. \r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 25, "closed_at": "1556379355", "comments": 62, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1555513026", "deletions": 318, "labels": ["alca-approved", "analysis-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "25010e721668384e32e606706012d003b579723e", "merged_at": "1556379355", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 26485, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 12, "state": "closed", "title": "New E/gamma Data members for UL", "updated_at": "1556379355", "user": "Sam-Harper"}

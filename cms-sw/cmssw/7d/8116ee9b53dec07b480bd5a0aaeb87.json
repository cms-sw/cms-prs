I have never seen the 'Physics Declared' actually trigger, and since some changes early 2019 also the actual DCS bit information is completely broken (I have not that much confidence that it was actually correct before, e.g. when some lumisections were not processed).\r\n\r\nDQMProvInfo provides roughly the same functionality (and more), is much\r\nsimpler and actually works, and is used in online since a long time.\r\n\r\nThis PR replaces DQMDcsInfo with DQMProvInfo also in offline.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRuns 136.85, more to be seen. DQMGUI render plugins need to be checked if they work on the new plot also in offline.\r\n\r\nUpdate: runs and seems to work correctly, Render Plugin handles both plots correctly.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nWe might want to backport this in the future to fix the DCS plot for the coming UL rereco.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 19, "closed_at": "1581959982", "comments": 31, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1580381795", "deletions": 476, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "6df4233eed87df85b7f0cfcd552b58f5779244b6", "merged_at": "1581959982", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 28829, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "DQM: Remove DQMDcsInfo", "updated_at": "1581959983", "user": "schneiml"}

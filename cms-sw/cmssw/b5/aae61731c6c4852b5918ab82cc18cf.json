For the plan-1 collapsed RecHits that do not exist in the actual detector, the HcalElectronicsId must not be used. One such case was hidden by an energy cut, so wasn't noticed earlier.\r\n- Take adc2fC conversion from conditions instead of a hard-coded table.\r\n- Integrated a fix for the number of samples in trigger primitive emulation, needed for TPTask to work.\r\n- Add HF dual anode asymmetry plots.\r\n- Smaller fixes: adjustments to axis ranges, ADC vs TDC plot, fix uMNIO crate# in fed2crate map, add HEP17 to local run tasks (LEDTask, PedestalTask, LaserTask).", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 31, "closed_at": "1495148887", "comments": 9, "commits": 23, "created_at": "1494240679", "deletions": 437, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "dqm-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_9_2_X", "number": 18618, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "HCALDQM: fix RecHitTask crash, adc2fC from DB, fix TPTask", "updated_at": "1495148887", "user": "DryRun"}

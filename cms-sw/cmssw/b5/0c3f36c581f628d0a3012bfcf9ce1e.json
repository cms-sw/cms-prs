It should be set to false, it is related to a feature which has access to the whole gain calibration DB payload to search for dead-pixels. This has never been implemented and there are no dead pixels in the gain payload.\nline: 50\n\n2) We don't need the variable \"AddPixelInefficiency\". There is \"AddPixelInefficiencyFromPython\" instead. \nline: 45\n\n3) Redundant commented variables.\nline: 54-55    \n\nIn SiPixelDigitizerAlgorithm.cc:\n\n4) There are several places where the first line in a method (e.g. pixel_inefficiency_db) is\n\nif(!...) return\n\nThis is unnecessary. The value of this parameter is already known before calling the relevant method.\nline: 1712, 1737, 1781\n\n5) In DriftDirection() method the formula to compute the dir_z and scale are the same. We should not calculate it twice.\ne.g. line: 1668\n\n6) In PixelEfficiencies struct we don't need the \"if (!...)\" block. Variables in this block are used only when \"AddPixelInefficiencyFromPython\" is true.\nfrom line: 442\n\n7) Classes PixelBarrelName and PixelEndcapName are not used anymore.\nline: 90-91\n\n8) In PixelAging struct we don't need the \"else\" block. Variables in this block are used only when AddPixelAging is true.\nfrom line: 488\n\n9) Some additional corrections of annoying bad indents\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_3_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1413963022", "comments": 5, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1413899600", "deletions": 185, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "20e218859ae2c1966079ec28ad9b3da8fdfddda6", "merged_at": "1413963022", "merged_by": "nclopezo", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_3_X", "number": 5912, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Pixel digitizer cleanup ", "updated_at": "1413963022", "user": "ahazi137"}

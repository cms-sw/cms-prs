This addresses fake-rate and splitting related observations made in Run 2 data. Details and results can be found in \r\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/1019373/contributions/4293207/attachments/2217496/3754437/2021-03-29-tuning.pdf\r\nand \r\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/1023338/contributions/4298206/attachments/2219781/3758715/2021-04-01-pvtuning.pdf\r\nThe code changes are\r\n1) remove the Tc control for merging. The net effect of this feature is an increased fake rate that does not justify the small gain in efficiency. Updates of Tc are now initiated by the split() routine.\r\n2) the proporionality constant of the outlier suppression term is increased from 1/#tracks to 1/#clusters. The value of dzCutOff can now be seen as the soft z-cut-off for an average cluster.\r\n\r\nSmall changes in the number and composition of reconstructed vertices are expected.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nThe code was tested with several 11_3_0_pre4 relval samples with the results reported in the presentations mentioned above.\r\nrunTheMatrix with this PR code on top of CMSSW_11_3_X_2021-04-05-2300 produces some errors, however, I can not see any connection to the vertex reconstruction  ( 37 34 26 18 14 4 1 1 1 tests passed, 0 2 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 failed )\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1618057763", "comments": 13, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1617712512", "deletions": 38, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "cd2c6828502da4db325710fa306655f5576ebc1f", "merged_at": "1618057763", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 33341, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "modified merging scheme and tighter outlier suppression  in primary vertex reconstruction", "updated_at": "1618057763", "user": "werdmann"}

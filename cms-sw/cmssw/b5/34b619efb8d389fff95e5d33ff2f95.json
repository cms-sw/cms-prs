For several weeks it was stable, but some recent change, possibly the new versions of DD4hep and ROOT, has re-activated its instability. Any change in the geometry causes a change in the simulation histories, which then changes the bit-wise results of simulation, even if there are no qualitative changes. Somehow, from run to run of the workflow, the geometry can be slightly changed, possibly due to an uninitialized variable taking on different values each time.\r\n\r\nNote that the instability being observed is on the 10% level, that is, about 90% of the time the workflow produces consistent results.\r\n\r\nThe failed comparisons in PR tests for this workflow create unnecessary confusion, so it is best to remove the workflow for now until the instability can be resolved.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1619673392", "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1619629048", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "orp-approved", "pdmv-approved", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "upgrade-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "f2a33b5f74ee3f1a38e1bbcb7bf17f2dadff0c34", "merged_at": "1619673392", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "number": 33568, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "[DD4he] Disable DD4hep workflow 11634.911 in PR tests while it produces unstable results", "updated_at": "1619673392", "user": "cvuosalo"}

Currently it is the /dev/CMSSW_9_0_0/ menu. It will become GRun + reverse customization function, as soon as the function will be ready\r\n- update of the symbolic update to use the 'phase1_2017_realistic'\r\n- update of the input files/eras to run the phase1 menu\r\n- add 'HLT:@relval2017' cmsDriver option to peak the 2017 HLT menu\r\n\r\nOpen issues:\r\n- we are waiting for the reverse customization function to get a 2016-like menu from the current menu\r\n- we need to update relval to use HLT:@relval2017 instead of HLT:@relval2016.\r\n- we need to update the IB tests to test also GRun2016\r\n- one of the test will fail, because of a issue with EcalAlCaRecoProducers. It is caused by this line https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/CMSSW_9_1_X/Calibration/EcalAlCaRecoProducers/plugins/SelectedElectronFEDListProducer.cc#L309 . I strongly suspect that this code is not yet compatible with the Phase-1 pixels. I contacted HLT AlCa ( @trtomei ).\r\nCC: @mtosi ", "branch": "CMSSW_9_1_X", "changed_files": 31, "closed_at": "1489054183", "comments": 1, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1489054170", "deletions": 123542, "labels": [], "number": 17846, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Update HLT validation to Phase1 (91X)", "updated_at": "1489054183", "user": "silviodonato"}

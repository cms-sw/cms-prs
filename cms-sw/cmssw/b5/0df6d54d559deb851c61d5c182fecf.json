This way, the client is now transfered back to a standalone executable, running forever, polling every second some beamspot and tracker status txt files on /nfshome0. To be placed likely in the startup of a local P5 machine, from where both the CMS-related DIP machine (cmsdimns1.cern.ch, cmsdimns2.cern.ch) and /nfshome0 are both visible and accessible.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested successfully on fu-c2f11-11-03, by looking at DIP-related pages to check proper placement of publications:\r\nhttps://cmsonline.cern.ch/webcenter/portal/cmsonline/pages_common/dcs/dipbrowser [under dip/CMS/...]\r\nhttps://ccde.cern.ch/nxcals/device/313400?subscriptionId=29210033\r\nhttps://ccde.cern.ch/nxcals/device/1731503?subscriptionId=29407975\r\nhttps://timber.cern.ch/query?tab=Visualization&configuration=38326\r\n\r\n#### PR issues:\r\n\r\nThe process is polling two files:\r\n /nfshome0/dqmpro/BeamMonitorDQM/BeamFitResults.txt\r\n /nfshome0/dqmpro/BeamMonitorDQM/BeamFitResults_TkStatus.txt\r\nwhere the latter has a very old timestamp (from 2018), so very likely the file related to tracker status is not written by any client.

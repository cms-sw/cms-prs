For convenience I quote description of the original PR:\r\n\r\nDear colleagues,\r\n\r\nthis is a pull request by @mbluj that contains modifications of the cone based tau reconstruction algorithm as used for the HLT to make it fit for upcoming data taking periods, as fallback in case that the planned HPS-port to the HLT won't be ready in time. I'm citing Michal's comments (*) and refer to him for further questions.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nRoger\r\n\r\n(*)\r\nThis PR is to modify the Cone-based tau builder (used at HLT) to fill some additional data members of produced PFTau not filled so far:\r\n* Size of signal cone (cone for PiZeros used);\r\n* Pt carried by signal PiZeros outside of the signal cone; it is important shape variable supporting isolation in rejecting jet->tau fakes;\r\n* Charge, pdgId, tau decay mode hypothesis.\r\n\r\nThe changes do not modify current HLT work-flow (the builder is used only at HLT), but provides new features (cf. 2) allowing better jet->tau fake rejection during 2017 data-taking.\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_9_1_X", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1494222474", "comments": 10, "commits": 14, "created_at": "1493966134", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "hlt-approved", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "6492e02a2b795d79a166c7077bbdfd8ffdc0cec2", "merged_at": "1494222474", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_1_X", "number": 18581, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Modification of cone based tau algorithm to furbish it as fallback solution for the HLT for upcoming data taking (91X)", "updated_at": "1494222474", "user": "mbluj"}

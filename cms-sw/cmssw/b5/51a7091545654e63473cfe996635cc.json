It may be desirable to try the request again, rather than failing immediately. This PR adds that functionality to the SONIC core framework, in such a way that it can be enabled (or not) by specific clients. The documentation is also updated.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nSeparate unit tests are added for this feature.\r\n\r\nThe case where the number of failures exceeds the number of allowed tries is not included in the unit tests, as it emits an exception. It has been tested privately, and the expected output was observed:\r\n```\r\n----- Begin Fatal Exception 10-Apr-2020 14:34:40 CDT-----------------------\r\nAn exception of category 'SonicCallFailed' occurred while\r\n   [0] Processing  Event run: 1 lumi: 1 event: 1 stream: 0\r\n   [1] Running path 'p3'\r\n   [2] Prefetching for module IntTestAnalyzer/'testerAsync'\r\n   [3] Calling method for module SonicDummyProducerAsync/'dummyAsync'\r\nException Message:\r\ncall failed after max 3 tries\r\n----- End Fatal Exception -------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1587449890", "comments": 23, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1587065593", "deletions": 29, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "heterogeneous-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "5141b556627f6e4362c170c0103484a0d4b45223", "merged_at": "1587449890", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 29503, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 5, "state": "closed", "title": "Handle retries in SONIC", "updated_at": "1587449890", "user": "kpedro88"}

This assignment is arbitrary in the local trigger, L1 = a1 x c1, L2 = a2 x c2. Where \"1\" is first in-time, \"2\" is second in-time. The EMTF examines all possible options for track building, including the ghost LCTs L1' = a1 x c2 and L2 = a2 x c1. I add an option - by default turned on - to match true muons to all LCTs.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested in CMSSW_11_2_0_pre3 on `/RelValSingleMuFlatPt2To100/CMSSW_11_0_0-PU25ns_110X_mcRun4_realistic_v3_2026D49PU200-v1/GEN-SIM-DIGI-RAW`\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1596607511", "comments": 11, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1596510344", "deletions": 38, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "d01c07555322429c0a2a1575bf74d28da67a2a6d", "merged_at": "1596607511", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 31041, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add ghost LCTs in CSC stub matcher", "updated_at": "1596607511", "user": "dildick"}

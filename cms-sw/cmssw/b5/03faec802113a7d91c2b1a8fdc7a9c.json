It uses the difference between residuals on overlapping modules to characterize the misalignment. \r\n\r\nDetails can be found here: \r\n[Overlap Validation Presentation](https://indico.cern.ch/event/787556/contributions/3282549/attachments/1779819/2895001/Weak_Modes_-_Radial_Validation_.pdf)\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe following is the Overlap Validation plot for a radial misalignment with various epsilon values:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39276191/56692365-05420200-66b0-11e9-80f2-3e9af88d3ae4.png)\r\n\r\nWe also implemented DMRs separated by track charge that highlights biases that cause Z-expansion in TEC.

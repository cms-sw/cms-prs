Investigation showed only ME1/2 LCTs (oddly enough) with invalid pattern numbers. This was fixed with https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/commit/9354dff643d672ed1d864559d757a53082355968. \r\n\r\nFurther investigation revealed that the CLCT processor readout function was not checking if CLCTs were valid, and that GEM-CSC motherboards do not check if incoming pads are valid. The code was also missing quality control. I added a number of `checkValid` functions that check the properties for ALCT/CLCT/LCT at various stages of the algorithm. LogErrors are printed in case values go out of bounds.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested on \r\n- `/RelValZMM_14/CMSSW_11_2_0_pre2-112X_mcRun3_2021_realistic_v2-v1/GEN-SIM-DIGI-RAW`\r\n- `/RelValSingleMuFlatPt2To100/CMSSW_11_0_0-PU25ns_110X_mcRun4_realistic_v3_2026D49PU200-v1/GEN-SIM-DIGI-RAW`\r\n- `/RelValSingleMuFlatPt2To100/CMSSW_11_0_0-110X_mcRun4_realistic_v2_2026D49noPU-v1/GEN-SIM-DIGI-RAW`\r\nI did not see LogErrors of invalid stubs.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nNeeds a backport to 11_1_X for the HLT TDR. https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/30914", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 18, "closed_at": "1596214407", "comments": 45, "commits": 13, "created_at": "1595623802", "deletions": 167, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "l1-pending", "orp-approved", "pending-signatures", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved", "urgent"], "merge_commit_sha": "343eb25a4f2cc7d563d4fbe3be6c5e5674e6b9e2", "merged_at": "1596214407", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 30909, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix broken LCTs reported in HLT_L1SingleMu25 [11_2_X]", "updated_at": "1596214408", "user": "dildick"}

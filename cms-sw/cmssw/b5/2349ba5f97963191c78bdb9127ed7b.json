This change will affect positions of the senstive volumes, even if it is just a few um.\r\n\r\n- For BPIX (thanks @zucchett )\r\n   - Correct material for Flange4. This significantly increases the mass of this volume, the old material was incorrect. \r\n   - Changs to densities to match measurements at PSI\r\n   - Changes to the Sector D shield material.\r\n   - Update to SupplyTubeConn3 to match Supply Tube weight measurements.\r\n\r\nIf we can get this into pre3, #17209 is obsolete; otherwise, we'll rebase this later.", "branch": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "changed_files": 12, "closed_at": "1485780977", "comments": 11, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1485103487", "deletions": 23, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "ac3b59c842c95f59cd71038dad7a461352ebbdeb", "merged_at": "1485780977", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "number": 17245, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Pixel Material Budget Changes (updated)", "updated_at": "1485780977", "user": "schneiml"}

Only the `pdgId` branch of the `simtrackstersSC` collection of the TICLDumper should change. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested on worfklows : \r\n - 29634.207,29693.207,29834.207 (TICLv5 with TICLDumper)\r\n - 29634.206,29693.206,29834.206 (TICLv4 with TICLDumper)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

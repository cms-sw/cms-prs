Part of this PR also introduces a typedef for a TTTrack<Ref_Phase2TrackerDigi_> to L1Track. This in my opinion should have been done a long time ago and such a typedef needs to exist centrally as people are already making their own. I dont care too much about the name. \r\n\r\nAdditionally in validation a \"bug\" was found with the track ambiguity solving for electrons in the HLT which will be fixed at a later date. Ie we seem to be picking the wrong track in a few cases and we should solve it. \r\n\r\nNote, an example test config will not be provided for 11_3_X because of the difficulties of porting the HLT phase II between releases.  A test config can be provided for 11_1_X on request but it'll be 50K lines of python\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested in phase-II HLT setup and gives expected results.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1610579503", "comments": 27, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1609409602", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["allow-Sam-Harper", "code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "hlt-approved", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "82f177ec66c6ed964ecfec55010443cae1581235", "merged_at": "1610579503", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 32594, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 41, "state": "closed", "title": "E/gamma HLT L1 Track Isolation Producer & TTTrack typedef: 11_3_X", "updated_at": "1610579503", "user": "Sam-Harper"}

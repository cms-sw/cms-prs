The tracking performance remains good on 1000 ttbar + 0 pile-up events.\r\n\r\nP.S. @skinnari shares responsibility for the code in this PR.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 77, "comments": 43, "commits": 36, "created_at": "1692954487", "deletions": 1336, "labels": ["simulation-pending", "l1-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-approved", "trk"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "number": 42663, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 45, "state": "open", "title": "Improvements to L1 tracking code", "updated_at": "1700042538", "user": "tomalin"}

Despite the branch name, this has actually been rebased of CMSSW_14_0_0_pre0.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis has been checked by the detailed git CI of the L1 track group. The tracking performance remains good on 1000 ttbar + 0 pile-up events.\r\n\r\nP.S. @skinnari shares responsibility for the code in this PR.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 78, "closed_at": "1702305456", "comments": 67, "commits": 38, "created_at": "1692954487", "deletions": 1337, "labels": ["l1-approved", "simulation-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "upgrade-approved", "code-checks-approved", "trk"], "merge_commit_sha": "afa2d7cf0bd787f6092b2ec162b44b9636561baa", "merged_at": "1702305456", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "number": 42663, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 45, "state": "closed", "title": "Improvements to L1 tracking code", "updated_at": "1702305457", "user": "tomalin"}

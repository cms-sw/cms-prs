One of them is `DQMHarvestDCS`, which I forgot to remove in #28829.\r\n\r\nBut also `DQMNone`, which is used to signify that there is nothing to do (`''` could be understood as default sequence, as usual in `cmsDriver`) is not actually defined in harvesting. So I added that to all the main config files.\r\n\r\nFinally, this PR makes `ConfigBuilder` fail on undefined harvesting sequences, like it does for other sequences. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nFunctionality should not be affected, but misconfigured jobs may crash now. I expect some PR and even IB failures untilwe catch all of them.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": "1585809455", "comments": 12, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1585585496", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "operations-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "a8b8247a5e235770935fa6cfc8cf82dbef6e510a", "merged_at": "1585809455", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 29343, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "DQM: fix some autoDQM.py harvesting sequences", "updated_at": "1585809455", "user": "schneiml"}

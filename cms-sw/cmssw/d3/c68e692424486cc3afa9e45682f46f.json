Also some things like `boost::shared_ptr` and `boost::tuples::tie` + `boost::tuple` are now available under C++ standard library thus we should avoid external dependency -- _boost_. There is now alternative for `boost::format`, but that could still be rewritten.", "branch": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1485357739", "comments": 9, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1485317353", "deletions": 12, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "ff8decc67555a66fd664fc61571d98655dc89684", "merged_at": "1485357739", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "number": 17273, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Cleanup throw specifier and boost stuff", "updated_at": "1485357739", "user": "davidlt"}

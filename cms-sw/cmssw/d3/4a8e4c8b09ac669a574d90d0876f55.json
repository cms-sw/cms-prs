Also necessary was an appropriate modification in L1TMuonOverlapObjectKeysOnlineProd.cc and little additions and modifications in several other packages in order to include the new record.  There is also some standalone test code of the new record in Utilities, which is of lesser importance.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe code has been tested with o2o.sh independently by myself and Hyejin Kwon, with input from the OMDS and output in a local sqlite file.  Everything was checked to work such as expected from o2o.  Writing and reading the new record in a standalone way was also tested using the code in Utilities.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 27, "comments": 3, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1635405777", "deletions": 13, "labels": ["l1-pending", "alca-pending", "db-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-rejected"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_2_X", "number": 35876, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 9, "state": "open", "title": "OMTF o2o upgrade", "updated_at": "1636534324", "user": "michalszleper"}

Should have no effect on any existing plot, just adds new plots.\n\n@rovere @VinInn \n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 25, "closed_at": "1427394893", "comments": 13, "commits": 13, "created_at": "1426768293", "deletions": 6565, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "9b6ae850929890d37ae3620bb6a108a72a642e7a", "merged_at": "1427394893", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 8412, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add purity plots to vertex validation plus some cleanup", "updated_at": "1476956271", "user": "makortel"}

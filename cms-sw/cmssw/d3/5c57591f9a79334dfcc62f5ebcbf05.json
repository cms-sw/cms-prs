Avoids a potential deadlock.\n- Primary signal handler will timeout after 5 minutes of waiting for\n  the stacktrace handler thread to return (timeout hardcoded for now).\n- Do NOT call execv: libsnoopy at CERN replaces the async-signal-safe\n  POSIX function with a non-async-signal-safe variant which can cause\n  deadlocks.  Instead, invoke the syscall directly (only on Linux).\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1444189874", "comments": 12, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1444158196", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["comparison-available", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "00c5d982559ccbd4c89a4ce0f607babc86292c51", "merged_at": "1444189874", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 11662, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Allow stacktrace handler to timeout.", "updated_at": "1444211180", "user": "bbockelm"}

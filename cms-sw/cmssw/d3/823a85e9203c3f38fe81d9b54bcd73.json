That class is used both in RecoEgamma and RecoEcal as well, justifying the transition to CommonTools. Like this, the dependency of RecoEgamma on RecoParticleFlow is eliminated.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the includes in HGCalShowerShapeHelper are cleaned to make it not appear like RecoEgamma/EgammaTools depends on RecoParticleFlow.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCMSSW compiles.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nNo backport intended.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 14, "closed_at": "1619097085", "comments": 11, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1618731096", "deletions": 28, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "b4bb14f6573e803ecbe516d306d651d9774d48b7", "merged_at": "1619097085", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "number": 33458, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Move PFClusterWidthAlgo into CommonTools/ParticleFlow", "updated_at": "1619097085", "user": "guitargeek"}

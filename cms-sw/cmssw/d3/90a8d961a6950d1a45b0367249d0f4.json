It includes the following upstream PRs:\r\n\r\ncms-sw/cmssw#48587\r\n-main refinement functionality, replaces DeepJet, UParT branches with refined values and adds backup _unrefined branches for each.\r\ncms-sw/cmssw#49429\r\n-Type-1 MET correction based on the refined jet pT values.\r\ncms-sw/cmssw#49400\r\n-RelVal fixes needed to not break workflows. \r\n\r\nPlease note that the original PR (listed above) is accompanied by the corresponding PR for cms-data, which contains the ML model as an ONNX file:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/cms-data/PhysicsTools-NanoAOD/pull/20\r\n\r\nBut the file is not accessible when working in CMSSW_15_0_X, so we need to tweak cms-data. \r\n\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_15_0_X", "changed_files": 7, "comments": 2, "commits": 16, "created_at": "1771594558", "deletions": 11, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "xpog-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_0_X", "number": 50209, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Backport FastSim jet refinement+Type-1 MET propagation to CMSSW_15_0_X", "updated_at": "1771594589", "user": "sbein"}

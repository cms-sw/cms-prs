We now track the entire redirection chain; for dCache, we want to blacklist a different host in the federation context than the pool that served the data.\n\nThis also improves our error messages to more reliably report the sitename in the dCache case.\n\nOther commits of note:\n- More aggressively try to balance the performance of the two active sources.\n- When we (rarely) have to break up a single ROOT ReadV into multiple Xrootd ReadV requests, we now pipeline the requests to the remote server.  This allows us to issue requests for all data before processing responses.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_3_DEVEL_X", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1416315176", "comments": 8, "commits": 9, "created_at": "1415980872", "deletions": 67, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "f65daa6dc86ad411a22e8c638ecd06134635affc", "merged_at": "1416315176", "merged_by": "nclopezo", "number": 6410, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 8, "state": "closed", "title": "Xrootd dCache Tunings", "updated_at": "1416315177", "user": "bbockelm"}

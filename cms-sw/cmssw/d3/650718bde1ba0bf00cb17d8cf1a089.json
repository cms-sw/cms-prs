This avoids the large number of `lazyEval = True` previously needed in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/44575.\r\n> \r\n> #### PR validation:\r\n> \r\n> Tested for all NANO workflows:\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> runTheMatrix.py --ibeos --nEvents 100 -w nano -i all -l 2500.0,2500.001,2500.002,2500.01,2500.011,2500.012,2500.1,2500.2,2500.21,2500.211,2500.3,2500.301,2500.31,2500.311,2500.312,2500.313,2500.32,2500.321,2500.322,2500.323,2500.324,2500.325,2500.326,2500.327,2500.4,2500.401,2500.402,2500.403,2500.404,2500.405,2500.5,2500.51\r\n> ```", "branch": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "changed_files": 35, "comments": 2, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1713847725", "deletions": 151, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "alca-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "backport", "xpog-pending", "trk"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "number": 44807, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[14_0_X] Using explicit lazy parsing & concrete data types in SimpleFlatTableProducer", "updated_at": "1713847754", "user": "hqucms"}

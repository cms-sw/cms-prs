I trace this down to some Nans.\nHere I try to trap Nans and conditions that will generate Nans.\nThe effect on OfflineVertices is essentially negligible while evident to PixelVertices.\nThis is also one of the reason that prompted #5476 \n\nFew more optimizations have been added to the algorithms.\nAdaptiveVertexFitter and KalmanVertexFitter (and the infrastructure used in there) would benefit of a complete re-engineering in light of C++11 and vectorization.\n\n@mtosi, could you please test this for HLT?\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_3_X", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1411729606", "comments": 12, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1411449286", "deletions": 86, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "edf4baf8a5746f2bd3112c9b799c73caa07e635d", "merged_at": "1411729606", "merged_by": "nclopezo", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_3_X", "number": 5490, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 12, "state": "closed", "title": "Avoid Nans in primary vertex", "updated_at": "1412844081", "user": "VinInn"}

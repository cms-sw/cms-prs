No point in rewriting another module to do the same thing.\n\nAlso, remove some inefficiency in validation by skipping files that have the run number in their filename if they are not in the selected run range.\n\nAnd a little fix in the geometry comparison.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1474389927", "comments": 15, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1474054357", "deletions": 47, "labels": ["alca-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "a0e3a3730cbe03765f9ae6856e88b47d4e3bdaf3", "merged_at": "1474389927", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 15886, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 12, "state": "closed", "title": "Script to create a HipPy input dataset file", "updated_at": "1475618382", "user": "hroskes"}

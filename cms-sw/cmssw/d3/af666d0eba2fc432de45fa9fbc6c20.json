The variables are not stored in MiniAODs so they need to be re-calculated again by scheduling [pileupJetIdCalculator](https://github.com/nurfikri89/cmssw/blob/0f44de31272b6a3807c27a7d5e536efc9608c1e2/PhysicsTools/NanoAOD/python/custom_jme_cff.py#L346). Then, the variables need to be stored in ValueMaps and this is done by [scheduling](https://github.com/nurfikri89/cmssw/blob/0f44de31272b6a3807c27a7d5e536efc9608c1e2/PhysicsTools/NanoAOD/python/custom_jme_cff.py#L357) PileupJetIDVarProducer [plugin](https://github.com/nurfikri89/cmssw/blob/0f44de31272b6a3807c27a7d5e536efc9608c1e2/PhysicsTools/NanoAOD/plugins/PileupJetIDVarProducer.cc) which will be added also. The [rest](https://github.com/nurfikri89/cmssw/blob/0f44de31272b6a3807c27a7d5e536efc9608c1e2/PhysicsTools/NanoAOD/python/custom_jme_cff.py#L366-L395) is just normal procedure to save variables in NanoAODs. At the moment, these variables are set to be calculated and stored only for AK4PFCHS jets.\r\n\r\nThis PR needs to be backported to 10_6_X, once merged, for the ultra legacy campaigns.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1575924056", "comments": 20, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1574231060", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved", "xpog-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "5cff93474e402ffc56054560431052b4ca25bf0b", "merged_at": "1575924056", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 28430, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add variables for PileUp Jet ID BDT in JME Custom-NanoAODs.", "updated_at": "1575924056", "user": "nurfikri89"}

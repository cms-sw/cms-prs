Such approach saves some lines of code but code navigation becomes impossible and readability decreases. \r\n\r\nDue to the fact that argument forwarding (`std::forward<Args>(args)...`) somehow caries out the type information of literal value arguments, different overloads are chosen after the update. Such cases were identified and fixed in this PR.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTo be added.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "comments": 15, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1552472370", "deletions": 34, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "dqm-pending", "hold", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-started"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 26161, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Replaced DQM histogram booking macro to regular methods inside IBooker", "updated_at": "1552493627", "user": "andrius-k"}

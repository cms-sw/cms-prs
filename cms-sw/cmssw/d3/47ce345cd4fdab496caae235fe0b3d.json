In our ROOT6 code, unlike our ROOT 5 code, the constructor for TypeWithDict throws a fatal exception if the class in question does not have a dictionary.\nTherefore, instead of invoking TypeWithDict(myTypeInfo).hasDictionary(), we must call the new free function hasDictionary(myTypeInfo) to check if the class has a dictionary.\nThis fix could, in principle, be made in the ROOT5 code as well, but that would involve some extra work.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_ROOT6_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1388466114", "comments": 0, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1388432781", "deletions": 1, "labels": [], "merge_commit_sha": "6427167440546709dfffd74c7473afc9f089860e", "merged_at": "1388466114", "merged_by": "davidlt", "number": 1932, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Use free function hasDictionary()", "updated_at": "1388502201", "user": "wmtan"}

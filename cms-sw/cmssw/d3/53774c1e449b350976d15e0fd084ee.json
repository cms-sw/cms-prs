I changed the code so now one passes the value as an\nargument of the function which uses the value. This also required changed\nErrorMatrixPropagator which was formerly taking a pointer to a function but\nnow sometimes the function being called needed an additional argument. Changing\nErrorMatrixPropagator to use a std::function<> instead of a pointer to a function\nas the argument fixed that problem.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1396259807", "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1395988900", "deletions": 15, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "0631b03ff8d4868c173721af8178edb9a973e673", "merged_at": "1396259807", "merged_by": "nclopezo", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_1_0_pre6", "number": 3062, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Removed use of static for temporary variable in TauA1NuConstrainedFitter", "updated_at": "1405070341", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

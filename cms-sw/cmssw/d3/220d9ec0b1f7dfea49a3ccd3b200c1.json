At present it does not seem really necessary, and I prefer to avoid proliferation of not strictly needed new scenarios,\r\nbut I would like to have an official reference for this revised implementation.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nNo overlap is present (even if plugged in tracker geometry T15), the numbering scheme is obviously untouched, if plugged in a new scenario the SingleMu workflow runs smoothly.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1561054229", "comments": 15, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1560945101", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "44d504fe304526fc5bce2b42416d3a5d58fb0fb5", "merged_at": "1561054229", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27276, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "MTD geometry: post D41 technical fixes", "updated_at": "1561054229", "user": "fabiocos"}

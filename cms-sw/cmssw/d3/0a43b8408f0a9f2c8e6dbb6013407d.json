Instead, this PR adds a call to a new member function `synchronize()` to `DeviceProduct<T>` destructor before the `T data_` member is destructed (such function necessitates the abstract base class, or some other form of type erasure).\r\n\r\nHopefully resolves https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/49822\r\nResolves https://github.com/cms-sw/framework-team/issues/1787\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nUnit tests pass.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

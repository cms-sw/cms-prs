A corresponding PR for 8_1_X is in the works (timescale unknown).\n\n@vanbesien, this should be safe to patch onto an 8_0_10 release online. It was a little slow to test from overseas, but the code compiles and runs in a fresh 8_0_9 release.\n\n@mzarucki @EsmaeelEskandari @nhaubrich @nsmith-, Is it okay to consider this the final PR based on the 8_0_9 DQM development branch? If so, I'll create an 8_0_10 DQM development branch for us to work on.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 48, "closed_at": "1469540412", "comments": 7, "commits": 56, "created_at": "1465386798", "deletions": 1358, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "dqm-pending", "l1-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "54e8484ff5aa5048061efb39fc1b85a640589fb7", "merged_at": "1469540412", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 14818, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "L1T DQM Developments for CMSSW_8_0_9", "updated_at": "1469540412", "user": "swang373"}

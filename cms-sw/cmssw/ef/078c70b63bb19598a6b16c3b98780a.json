Now,\nTFormula is a member of TF1. Thus an aditional hop is required for\n`GetExpFormula(Option_t *)`. This is not the case for `GetExpFormula()`.\n\nI asked Lorenzo if he could add a const wrapper for `GetExpFormula(Option_t *)`\nalso. If he agrees, this can be reverted back.\n\nNote that changes are applied if new ROOT is used, thus should have 0 effect\nin CMSSW_7_5_X, which is running ROOT 6.02.XX.\n\nNew ROOT will be added in DEVEL IBs in a few days.\n\nSigned-off-by: David Abdurachmanov David.Abdurachmanov@cern.ch\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1432742528", "comments": 13, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1432298858", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["alca-approved", "comparison-available", "db-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 9235, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix using GetExpFormula(Option_t *) on TF1 in ROOT 6.04.00", "updated_at": "1432742528", "user": "davidlt"}

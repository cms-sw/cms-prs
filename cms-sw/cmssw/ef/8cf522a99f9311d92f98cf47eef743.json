New objects are allocated each run, and in some cases the previously allocated objects were not deleted before the new ones were allocated.  Rather than deciphering the mess and adding the delete operator where needed, it was much easier and better to switch to smart pointers.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1428385316", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1428086505", "deletions": 48, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fastsim-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "a335175261a2d915b77fac38eaf21882aa44cf71", "merged_at": "1428385316", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 8661, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "add consumes interface, and fix memory leaks in FastTSGFromPropagation", "updated_at": "1428943839", "user": "wmtan"}

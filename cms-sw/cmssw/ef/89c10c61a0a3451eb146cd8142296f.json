The LUTs were deployed at P5 on October 6th, but they are not used in the emulator yet. \r\n\r\nThis PR needs the LUTs in https://github.com/cms-data/L1Trigger-L1TMuon/pull/23 to work.\r\n\r\nWe see improvement in EMTF performance at P5 with these new LUTs, so changes to muon efficiencies etc are expected when testing the re-emulation workflows from recent runs (after October 6th). Otherwise this PR shouldn't change anything in the emulator.\r\n\r\nThis PR should be backported to 12_4 if there is an opportunity to run this at P5 to improve data/emulator comparisons in DQM. If data taking with 12_5 is expected we should also backport it there. \r\n\r\nThis has no effect on MC production so MC campaigns do not matter for the purpose of this PR.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with a description of the feature proposed or problem addressed, specifying:\r\n  - what changes are expected in the output if any, \r\n  - what other PRs or externals it depends upon if any,\r\n  - link to any additional material useful to provide a documentation for this PR (slides, JIRA tickets, related pull requestes, hypernews, TWiki or Indico pages)  -->\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nValidated with the workflow from https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/39822#issuecomment-1290545788 since the regular test workflows are not useful for this PR. \r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with a description of which tests have been performed to verify the correctness of the PR, including the eventual addition of new code for testing like unit tests, test configurations, additions or updates to the runTheMatrix test workflows -->\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

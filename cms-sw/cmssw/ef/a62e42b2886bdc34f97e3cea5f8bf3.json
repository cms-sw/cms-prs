Small optimisations are also applied (e.g. using delta-R^2 instead of delta-R).~~\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new plugin template which offers a modernised version of the HLT plugin `PFJetsMatchedToFilteredCaloJetsProducer`, and allows to support both `reco::CaloJetRef` and `reco::PFJetRef` (via template instantiations).\r\n\r\nThe existing plugin `PFJetsMatchedToFilteredCaloJetsProducer` remains in place. ~~but now as one instantiation of the new plugin template.~~\r\n\r\nNew classes ~~(the template itself, and the new instantiation to support `reco::PFJetRef`)~~ follow the HLT convention of having the plugin name start with `HLT`. The label `PF` is kept in the name to indicate the type of the output collection, which remains fixed (the plugin template could likely be made even more generic, but I would postpone this to a future PR).\r\n\r\n~~The name of the existing plugin (i.e. `PFJetsMatchedToFilteredCaloJetsProducer`) is not modified in order to make this update transparent to all HLT configurations.~~\r\n\r\n_Edit_ (see https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/37057#issuecomment-1050093677): the existing plugin (i.e. `PFJetsMatchedToFilteredCaloJetsProducer`) is kept in the code base. It will be removed in a future PR, after it is replaced by `HLTPFJetsMatchedToFilteredCaloJetsProducer` in the HLT menus in ConfDB. This will only be a technical change, to update the name of the plugin.\r\n\r\n~~_Edit_ (see https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/37057#issuecomment-1050093677): the names of the parameters of `PFJetsMatchedToFilteredCaloJetsProducer` do change in this PR, because they now come from the plugin template, where they need to be made more generic. This requires a customisation of the HLT configurations, done in `customiseHLTforCMSSW`.~~\r\n\r\nThe original version of this PR evolved based on https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/37057#issuecomment-1050093677 and https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/37057#issuecomment-1050222548.\r\n\r\nThis PR simply adds a couple of plugins for HLT, and it does not affect any HLT menus nor any central wfs.\r\n\r\nMerely technical. No changes expected.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n`addOnTests` passed. Also, checked that TriggerResults and all TriggerObjects produced in the HLT step are unchanged for 100 events of a Run-3 MC file.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nN/A", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1645933567", "comments": 17, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1645713878", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["hlt-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "f87abe5f089a195a9b710190766ed23fd42888b7", "merged_at": "1645933567", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 37057, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "modernise and template HLT plugin for matching of two Jet collections", "updated_at": "1645933567", "user": "missirol"}

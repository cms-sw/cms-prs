Small optimisations are also applied (e.g. using delta-R^2 instead of delta-R).\r\n\r\nThe existing plugin `PFJetsMatchedToFilteredCaloJetsProducer` remains in place, but now as one instantiation of the new plugin template.\r\n\r\nNew classes (the template itself, and the new instantiation to support `reco::PFJetRef`) follow the HLT convention of having the plugin name start with `HLT`. The label `PF` is kept in the name to indicate the type of the output collection, which remains fixed (the plugin template could likely be made even more generic, but I would postpone this to a future PR).\r\n\r\nThe name of the existing plugin (i.e. `PFJetsMatchedToFilteredCaloJetsProducer`), and of the configuration parameters, is not modified in order to make this update transparent to all HLT configurations.\r\n\r\nMerely technical. No changes expected.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n`addOnTests` passed. Also, checked that TriggerResults and all TriggerObjects produced in the HLT step are unchanged for 100 events of a Run-3 MC file.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nN/A", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 4, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1645713878", "deletions": 117, "labels": ["hlt-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 37057, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "modernise and template HLT plugin for matching of two Jet collections", "updated_at": "1645716079", "user": "missirol"}

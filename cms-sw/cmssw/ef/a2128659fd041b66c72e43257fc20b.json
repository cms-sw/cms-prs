It does not work around all the effects of this bug, but it does work around the most common effect of this bug.  With this workaround, many release validation tests will actually pass, while many others will fail for other reasons, which can now be investigated.\nPlease merge this request promptly.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_2_ROOT6_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1405358126", "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1405357902", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "a3e6de45c17536b3dd886bd30219ea9a7fa7c8f5", "merged_at": "1405358126", "merged_by": "davidlt", "number": 4643, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Hideous kludge to partially work around ROOT6 bug with enums", "updated_at": "1405522877", "user": "wmtan"}

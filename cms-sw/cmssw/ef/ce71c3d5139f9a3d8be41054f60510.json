They are initially set in the `SiPixelRawToClusterCUDA` class.\r\n\r\nThe `SiPixelDigisClustersFromSoA` has these parameters as private members (as does the legacy version).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThese changes should not affect validation results.  \r\nPerformance should not be affected.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with a description of which tests have been performed to verify the correctness of the PR, including the eventual addition of new code for testing like unit tests, test configurations, additions or updates to the runTheMatrix test workflows -->\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": "1617919116", "comments": 40, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1616596860", "deletions": 10, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "eae9f054cf1f5c5e29364163adaae9e1d472395b", "merged_at": "1617919116", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 33259, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 41, "state": "closed", "title": "GPU pixel local reconstruction: make the pixel cluster thresholds configurable", "updated_at": "1617919116", "user": "czangela"}

Before this PR request, an update of DQMGUI layout was already committed and merged: [github link](https://github.com/dmwm/deployment/pull/1311). The PR in DQMGUI layout ensures there is no problem when rendering two different version of root files (one with 13 TeV and the other with 13.6 TeV). \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nWe have tested this PR at the playback machines using DQM streamers of cosmic run 378711, 900 GeV pp run 378239, 13.6 TeV pp run 379315. All displayed as expected in the reportSummaryMap.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1713338808", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 44757, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[DQM] reportSummaryMap: change the sqrt(s) energy from 13 to 13.6 TeV", "updated_at": "1713338830", "user": "syuvivida"}

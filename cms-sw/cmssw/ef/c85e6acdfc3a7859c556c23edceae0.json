This PR implements the combination of this automated recovery with the usual candidate seeded tracking regions used at HLT by finding the intersection between the regions found by the recovery procedure and using those for HLT tracking. This will allow us to make HLT tracking robust against current and future problems with the pixel detector. \r\n\r\nSome performances notes can be found here https://cernbox.cern.ch/index.php/s/AuCleNY9dq9k8gh, \r\ntogether with plots showing that the new code does not impact the current functionality.

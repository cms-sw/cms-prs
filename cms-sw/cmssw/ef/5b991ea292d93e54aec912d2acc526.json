Each of these headers contains only one line, and the line begins with '#error', insuring that nothing containing these headers would compile.  Furthermore, none of these headers contains any information on what header, if any, should be included instead, so they are useless.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 20, "closed_at": "1424423589", "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1424374143", "deletions": 20, "labels": ["comparison-available", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "cfdf9d035324ef02f816d35c8ff2055f14f54ff9", "merged_at": "1424423589", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 7874, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Remove obsolete poisoned headers from the framework", "updated_at": "1424435672", "user": "wmtan"}

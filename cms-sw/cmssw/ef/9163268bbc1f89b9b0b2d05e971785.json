Two new records are added, JetResolutionRcd and JetResolutionScaleFactorRcd, storing respectively resolutions and scale factors. Both resolutions and scale factors are converted to a common object, JetResolutionObject, which is serialized into the corresponding records.\n\nFacility are provided to create a database from text files [1] and to create text files from a database or a GT [2].\n\nUsers can access values using the classes JetResolution and JetResolutionScaleFactors. A static function is provided to hide the boilerplate to retrieve the object from the condition database. A demo analyzer is included as an how-to tutorial [3] and is ran as an unit-test for the package.\n\nThis depends also on two data files used for unit-testing. ~~Corresponding PR is pending for inclusion on the cms-data org [4]~~. PR is merged.\n\nThis interface has been presented and validated at the JERC meeting on 07/23.\n\nThis will need to be backported into CMSSW 7.5.x and probably also 7.4.x\n\n[1] https://github.com/blinkseb/cmssw/blob/665bd5d702f5ed976a898b7f8c426a5955eaf103/JetMETCorrections/Modules/test/JetResolutionDBWriter_cfg.py\n[2] https://github.com/blinkseb/cmssw/blob/665bd5d702f5ed976a898b7f8c426a5955eaf103/JetMETCorrections/Modules/test/JetResolutionLocalDBReader_cfg.py\n[3] https://github.com/blinkseb/cmssw/blob/665bd5d702f5ed976a898b7f8c426a5955eaf103/JetMETCorrections/Modules/plugins/JetResolutionDemo.cc\n[4] https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/10350\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 30, "closed_at": "1443607596", "comments": 29, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1438155576", "deletions": 8, "labels": ["alca-approved", "analysis-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "d6577cac3a2121e480ee60f0800665311e741047", "merged_at": "1443607596", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 10448, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "JER integration into conditions database", "updated_at": "1443607596", "user": "blinkseb"}

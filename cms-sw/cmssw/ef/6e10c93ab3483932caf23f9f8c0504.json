The calorimeters and muon system now generate hits and energy depositions as if it the chargino were a muon instead of not at all.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with a description of which tests have been performed to verify the correctness of the PR, including the eventual addition of new code for testing like unit tests, test configurations, additions or updates to the runTheMatrix test workflows -->\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\n\r\nBefore submitting your pull requests, make sure you followed this checklist:\r\n- verify that the PR is really intended for the chosen branch\r\n- verify that changes follow [CMS Naming, Coding, And Style Rules](http://cms-sw.github.io/cms_coding_rules.html)\r\n- verify that the PR passes the basic test procedure suggested in the [CMSSW PR instructions](https://cms-sw.github.io/PRWorkflow.html)\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1567530295", "comments": 20, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1562070593", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fastsim-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "97a9c73e5a8b4c0dc1b97058309cd12b100abdd6", "merged_at": "1567530295", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27425, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "updated FastSim treatment of long-lived charginos in the muon system", "updated_at": "1567530295", "user": "sbein"}

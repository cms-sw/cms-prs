This allows concurrent LuminosityBlocks to be processed properly.\r\n\r\nSupport for concurrent Runs would require further work.\r\n\r\nAdded unit tests to be sure the behavior remains the same.\r\n\r\nThis change is needed to allow workflows containing this module to be able to use concurrent LuminosityBlocks. This includes the new workflow which is testing such concurrency, 1631.181.\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe new unit test passes.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 38, "closed_at": "1568350963", "comments": 19, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1568122070", "deletions": 278, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "hlt-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "c1fd060fc42de9505740c5f157675f858a5f9ffd", "merged_at": "1568350962", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27961, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 6, "state": "closed", "title": "Support concurrent LuminosityBlocks in HLTrigReport", "updated_at": "1568350963", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

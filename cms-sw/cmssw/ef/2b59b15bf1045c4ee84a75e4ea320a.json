The model includes now a much more detailed description of all the passive components, and the material budget validation code is updated to monitor this new scenario. The crystal layout is conceptually unchanged, but the numbering is revised to better reflect the real engineering structure of the detector. In particular at tracking level the models move from an artificial definition of 3 x 16 crystal matrices to simple arrays of 16 crystals, increasing by a factor of 3 the number of modules. A detailed description of the various updates can be found in\r\n\r\n[https://indico.cern.ch/event/1183866/contributions/4973544/attachments/2484059/4264823/btl_geometry.pdf](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1183866/contributions/4973544/attachments/2484059/4264823/btl_geometry.pdf)\r\n[https://indico.cern.ch/event/1183866/contributions/4973544/attachments/2484059/4264824/MTDDPG_BTLgeometryV2_20220722.pdf](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1183866/contributions/4973544/attachments/2484059/4264824/MTDDPG_BTLgeometryV2_20220722.pdf)\r\n[https://indico.cern.ch/event/1205335/contributions/5068947/attachments/2519146/4331505/MTDDPG_BTLgeometryV2_20220930.pdf](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1205335/contributions/5068947/attachments/2519146/4331505/MTDDPG_BTLgeometryV2_20220930.pdf)\r\n\r\nThis new BTL model requires the Outer Tracker boundary to be moved, and therefore needs to be based on tracker T31 or later, as implemented in #39592 .\r\nTwo new geometry scenarios have been proposed, based on earlier scenario and updating MTD (and Tracker), namely\r\nD95 (from D88) and D96 (from D92).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nAll the standalone geometry tests (including unit tests) provide meaningful results. No overlap is detected by using Geant4 checks. RelVal worflows have been added for scenarios D95 and D96, they run without issues, and inspection of a 10k sample of SingleMuonPt100 histograms shows meaningful results. \r\n\r\nThe test workflows will need to be updated as soon as #39571 is integrated.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 43, "comments": 12, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1665126415", "deletions": 221, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "dqm-pending", "geometry-pending", "operations-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-rejected", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "upgrade-pending", "requires-external", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_6_X", "number": 39670, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "MTD geometry: update BTL description", "updated_at": "1665175396", "user": "fabiocos"}

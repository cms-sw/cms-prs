So the runTheMatrix test are not affected.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles, no runTheMatrix is affected\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nNot a backport, but plan to use it in analysis so will be backported\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 7, "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1753110742", "deletions": 7, "labels": ["generators-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 48594, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Add new functionality for upward going case in the Cosmics generator", "updated_at": "1753128337", "user": "tvami"}

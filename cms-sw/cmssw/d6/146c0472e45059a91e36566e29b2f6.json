As suggested in that discussion, the GEN and DIGI2RAW are dropped from the output file at the HLT step. While it makes perfect sense to also drop the SIM collections, the HARVESTING step crashes in EcalDQMonitorClient:ecalMonitorClient. Maybe @cms-sw/dqm-l2 would have an idea why it happens. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRan the new wfs.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nNot a backport.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 12, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1650209886", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "tests-rejected", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 37603, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "open", "title": "Add wfs with HLT as separate step", "updated_at": "1650217760", "user": "kskovpen"}

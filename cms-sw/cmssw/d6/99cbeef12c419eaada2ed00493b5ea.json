What effectively was a double loop (once over the vector SingleCombinationInCondition and once over the object types) was causing seeding combinations to be n^2, where n is the larger number of seeds of the two object types.  Some of the objects of the type with smaller number of passing objects were not necessarily passing the L1T conditions but were still being promoted as seeds, creating ghosts.\n\nThe code was previously looping both over object types and over vector SingleCombinationInCondition.\nThis is fixed by now only looping over SingleCombinationInCondition while tracking the object\ntype to seed properly. \n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1467127123", "comments": 17, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1467023871", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "hlt-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "682668da08f47d22d6b86f9b92493ab1c627c499", "merged_at": "1467127123", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 14992, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "PR 81X Fix sporadic crashes in HLT when Seeding with correlations.", "updated_at": "1467127123", "user": "rekovic"}

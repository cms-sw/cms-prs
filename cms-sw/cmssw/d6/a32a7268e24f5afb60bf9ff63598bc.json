Anyway we checked that the response is \r\nclose to the multifit one [(presentation),](https://indico.cern.ch/event/590956/contributions/2391934/attachments/1384258/2105710/multifit-gainswitch.pdf) and it is the Run1 algorithm for very high energy pulses. \r\n\r\nFor HLT this will make a negligible difference wrt to what we had in 2016, in terms of rates and CPU time.\r\n\r\n@amassiro @lgray @bendavid @shervin86 ", "branch": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1485777097", "comments": 13, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1485338336", "deletions": 7, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "414e2d4a899e06193c4468c31a339d455c486b0c", "merged_at": "1485777097", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "number": 17279, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Optional use of Max-Sample algorithm for gain-switch cases", "updated_at": "1485777097", "user": "emanueledimarco"}

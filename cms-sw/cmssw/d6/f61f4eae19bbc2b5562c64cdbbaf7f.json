These functions no longer create the principal. Therefore, there is no need for them to return a pointer to the principal.\nWith this pull request, these functions now return void or bool, as appropriate.\nAlso, the functions readAndCacheRun and readAndCacheLumi were modified to fill in the principal rather than creating it, and were renamed readRun and readLuminosityBlock respectively, because the caching of the principal\nhas been moved outside these functions.\n\nThe changes outside the framework are just minimal adaptions to the framework changes.\n\nThese changes have been tested by runTheMatrix.py -s and unit tests.  The full runTheMatrix.py is in progress.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 40, "closed_at": "1377895368", "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1377634173", "deletions": 636, "labels": ["core-approved", "daq-pending", "dqm-approved", "generators-pending", "pending-signatures"], "milestone": "CMSSW_7_0_0_pre4", "number": 641, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "Don't return pointer to principal", "updated_at": "1406901033", "user": "wmtan"}

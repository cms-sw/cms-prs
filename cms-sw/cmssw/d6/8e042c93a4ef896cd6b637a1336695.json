{"additions": 495, "auther_ref": "SpecifyRunNumberForEachLumi", "auther_sha": "06ad69dee24e6e3044d04382dc53a689c4ab1163", "author": "wmtan", "body": "This PR implements a new parameter \"setRunNumberForEachLumi\" for PoolSource, which allows a user to specify a new run number for each consecutive lumi in a single run in the simulation input. The run may be split across multiple input files. There must be at least as many entries in the parameter as the number of lumis that are read.\nUnit tests for this feature are also implemented.\nWhile implementing this new parameter, I made four synergistic improvements not directly related to the new feature:\n1) The function ThinnedAssociationsHelper:updateFromInput was actually two different unrelated functions cobbled together in a suboptimal way that resulted in the need to pass unused arguments in some cases. So, I refactored this function into two much cleaner functions.\n2) I also added two new delegating constructors for class RootFIle.\n3) I also eliminated the need for constructing dummy arguments fo the RootFile constructors by using pointers instead of references, so that nullptr could be used instead of a default constructed dummy.\n4) I put the use of the two parameters that renumber runs into a helper class using the strategy pattern.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 18, "closed_at": "1450844432", "comments": 15, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1449784138", "deletions": 165, "labels": ["comparison-available", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "60138c78d125db89ebd40c9c766a3901e3614b92", "merged_at": "1450844432", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 12753, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 6, "state": "closed", "title": "Add PoolSource parameter to specify run number for each lumi", "updated_at": "1454700044", "user": "wmtan"}

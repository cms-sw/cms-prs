Send some events to a remote process via MPI\r\n    2. In the remote process, an `edm::ModuloEventIDFilter` module filters out all events whose `eventID % 3 != 0`.\r\n    3. Non rejected events are sent back to the local process.\r\n    4. The same `edm::ModuloEventIDFilter` runs in the Controller process, and a `PathStatusFilter` is used to verify that the local and the remote paths produce the same result.\r\n  - The test consists on the following files:\r\n    - `controller_filters_cfg.py` and `follower_filters_cfg.py`, the local and remote configurations respectively\r\n\r\nOther than adding the test, this PR introduces the following changes:\r\n- fix several inconsistent types in the metadata messages\r\n- Removed obsolete comments\r\n- Modified some comments to make them clearer\r\n- Fixed various typos\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n- The added test passes", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 18, "comments": 34, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1769377758", "deletions": 106, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved", "heterogeneous-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_1_X", "number": 49935, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 14, "state": "open", "title": "Add a simple test to check the remote filter functionality; cleanup `HeterogeneousCore/MPICore`", "updated_at": "1769619107", "user": "ghyls"}

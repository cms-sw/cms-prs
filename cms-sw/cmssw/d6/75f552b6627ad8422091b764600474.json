This anyway was never followed by further integration, as it turned to be much more complex, and requiring a complete integration of MTD geometry into the Tracker one to make the goal really possible. \r\n\r\nThe drawback of this first step was the creation of a dependency of RecoTracker, TrackingTools and many other packages through them on the MTD DetIds and geometry, causing any update  of them to trigger a recompilation of large part of CMSSW.\r\n\r\nThis PR removes effectively this unused dependency.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles and builds, test wf. 26634.0 runs smoothly.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 10, "closed_at": "1759210746", "comments": 12, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1758887479", "deletions": 218, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved", "tracking"], "merge_commit_sha": "17320aaa11b06852fa9fc58e7ab8a21a2bbde5a4", "merged_at": "1759210746", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_16_0_X", "number": 49000, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Reconstruction: remove RecoTracker dependency on MTD", "updated_at": "1759210747", "user": "fabiocos"}

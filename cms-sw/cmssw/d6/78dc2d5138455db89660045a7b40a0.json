This makes the checking independent of naming conventions, and also reduces string demangling and other string manipulations.\nThis pull request also changes the obsolete \"gROOT->GetClass()\" to the preferred equivalent, \"TClass::GetClass()\", in the framework.\nPlease merge this pull request as soon as convenient.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_3_ROOT6_X", "changed_files": 14, "closed_at": "1410981531", "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1410977764", "deletions": 68, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "core-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "e873d7de3d9a05f74ebc64c32f473917076f70df", "merged_at": "1410981531", "merged_by": "davidlt", "number": 5399, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Use class type_info, rather than class name, for dictionary checking", "updated_at": "1411750503", "user": "wmtan"}

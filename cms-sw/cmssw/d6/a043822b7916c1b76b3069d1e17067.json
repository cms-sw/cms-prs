I had queued these two changes for 7_4_ROOT6_X five days ago, but they did not get merged in time for the conversion of 7_4_X to ROOT6, which restored the spurious link dependency in 7_4_X.  This PR cleans this all up.\nAs this is totally technical, please bypass L2 signatures if not signed in a timely manner.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1427905630", "comments": 4, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1427822130", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-available", "dqm-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "57d8b1d014073cd315f4c4e9fb5a7816bc2c5b53", "merged_at": "1427905630", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 8622, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Remove unnecessary link dependency and blank line (Code commonality)", "updated_at": "1427978364", "user": "wmtan"}

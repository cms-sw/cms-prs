Modify the phase1 customisation such that it can be used together with `Run2_2017` era, and add the `--era Run2_2017` to phase1 workflows in RelVal matrix\n2. Strip the DQM, VALIDATION, and HARVESTING sequences to (almost) their minimum, and add them to phase1 workflows in RelVal matrix\n   - actually current implementation adds them back to all upgrade workflows (AFAICT)\n\nThe motivation for the first change is that we can start using the `phase1Pixel` era in the tracking code (first in validation, as is done in this PR). With the second change, we get the tracking validation to be run by default in the phase1 workflows (i.e. we don't need to run them ourselves for release validation, and the results end up in DQM GUI).\n\nIn addition, fix phase1TkCustoms for tracking-only reco.\n\n~~Note that this PR conflicts with #12747, please integrate it before this one. I wanted to post this PR for discussion nevertheless now.~~\n\nTested in 8_0_0_pre3 (rebased on top of ~~CMSSW_8_0_X_2015-12-19-1100~~ CMSSW_8_0_X_2016-01-20-2300); for phase1 with ~~`-w upgrade -l 10000.0,15639.0`~~ `-w upgrade -l 10000.0,10239.0`. No changes expected in Run2 workflows.\n\nFYI @rovere @VinInn @boudoul @atricomi @mark-grimes \n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1454408755", "comments": 53, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1450259549", "deletions": 26, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "pdmv-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "0d42c9fd24b9874a73be8702b644b16f61687eb5", "merged_at": "1454408755", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 12806, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Use phase1 customisation and era simultaneously, and add stripped DQM,VALIDATION and HARVESTING back to phase1 workflow", "updated_at": "1476957062", "user": "makortel"}

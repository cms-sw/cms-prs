The new, D-shaped sectors comprise more than 512 modules, which is the maximum number of modules that can be accommodated using the bits presently allocated in ETLDetId. ETLDetId.h has been modified to fix this issue, by adding 2 bits. The new ETLDetId is backward compatible with the older versions, thanks to a dedicated compatibility code implemented, and active in all relevant constructors.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe dedicated geometry tests provide the desired ETL det id, test wf 23234.0 and 23434.999 complete successfully.

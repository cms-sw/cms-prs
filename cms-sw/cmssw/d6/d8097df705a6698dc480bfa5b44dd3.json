It clusters the final LHE particles using the anti-kt jet algorithm. A cut on the minimum pT > 350 GeV is selected. This filter is a loose pre-selection of the AK8-jet pT > 650 GeV filter at particle level used in the production of TT_AK8HT650* samples. The pre-filter selects at LHE level 99.8% of the events with a jet of pT > 650 GeV at particle level, while only 3% of the inclusive ttbar sample passes the filter. Therefore, the number of events that have to be showered before the filter decision is drastically reduced.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTests have shown that this pre-filter reduces the the run time per event from ~1.3s to ~0.2s.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\n\r\nBackport of #27809\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_9_3_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1568138676", "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1567145332", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "generators-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "88606c2892b51cf44ad2c581d07ef62b6df8b194", "merged_at": "1568138676", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_3_X", "number": 27902, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "rebase of LHEJetFilter", "updated_at": "1568138676", "user": "ohindrichs"}

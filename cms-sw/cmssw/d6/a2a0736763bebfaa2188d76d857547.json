Reason is that the CSCGEMMotherboard builds LCTs in Run-3 according to the following priority: (1) ALCT-CLCT-2GEM (2) ALCT-CLCT-1GEM (3) ALCT-CLCT (4) CLCT-2GEM (5) ALCT-2GEM. Previously step (3) was taken together with (1) and (2), but they should be independent. This is because all options except (3) can be switched off. (3) is always on.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested with Run-3 single muon guns.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n@tahuang1991 @giovanni-mocellin @rathjd\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 8, "comments": 35, "commits": 9, "created_at": "1636427778", "deletions": 136, "labels": ["l1-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_2_X", "number": 36046, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Minor update in the CSC/GEM-CSC trigger for Run-3: split regular ALCT-CLCT off from ALCT-CLCT-GEM matching", "updated_at": "1638232617", "user": "dildick"}

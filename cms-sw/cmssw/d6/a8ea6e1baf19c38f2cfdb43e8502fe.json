We expect to update it with a more realistic firmware implementation.\r\n  - Model and expected performance plots shown here: https://github.com/cms-hls4ml/L1METML/blob/main/README.md\r\n  - Currently enabled for testing; but plan to switch it off to run standard MET by default\r\n  - L1T Offline PR: https://github.com/cms-l1t-offline/cmssw/pull/1193\r\n  - Model external repo: https://github.com/cms-hls4ml/L1METML\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n - In progress", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "comments": 8, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1703225573", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["l1-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "number": 43633, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Add Phase-2 Level-1 trigger ML MET emulator", "updated_at": "1705339667", "user": "jmduarte"}

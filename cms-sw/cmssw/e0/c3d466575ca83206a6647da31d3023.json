This led to the realization that the parton selection for Pythia8 was not inclusive enough and in particular was failing to pick up some of the b and c quarks, resulting in spoiled b-tag performance curves in the b-tag DQM.\n\nIn addition, the selection of b and c quarks for MiniAOD was updated by dropping any selection based on the particle status code. The increase in the MiniAOD size resulting from this PR was tested by making MiniAOD from /RelValTTbar_13/CMSSW_7_6_0_pre5-76X_mcRun2_asymptotic_v1-v1/GEN-SIM-RECO and was found to be small (~0.9%).\n\n**Update (Oct. 5, 2015):** More details in the following presentation https://indico.cern.ch/event/449888/contribution/5/attachments/1164881/1679186/FlavourValidation.pdf shown in the b-tag meeting on Oct. 5\nAutomatically ported from CMSSW_7_6_X #11612 (original by @cms-btv-pog).\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1446883888", "comments": 7, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1445232274", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "a3a45ef50ceb49cab0600dbc41485435ef3002fd", "merged_at": "1446883888", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 11890, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Updated flavor parton selection for Pythia8", "updated_at": "1447677205", "user": "cmsbuild"}

As a result of test few files are created with dumps of information: \r\n   1) elements/material/cuts\r\n   2) Geant4 regions\r\n   3) Geant4 mother volumes (according to request it may be a world or some logical volume)\r\n   4) Geant4 overlap check\r\n\r\nSome classes are moved from SimG4Core/Application to SimG4Core/Geometry in order to have a correct dependecy between sub-libraries. Some files are renamed to avoid classes started from \"G4\".\r\n\r\nMainstream simulation should not be affected. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nprivate\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 24, "closed_at": "1564251852", "comments": 30, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1563952610", "deletions": 331, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "ef0a99f52d4e4bc81449be8447ee7ca67a9a2f45", "merged_at": "1564251852", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27592, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 4, "state": "closed", "title": "Extended test on Geant4 geometry ", "updated_at": "1564251853", "user": "civanch"}

There is no reason that this data member needs to be static.  Even in the unlikely case of multiple instances of the mixing module in a job, the value can be set separately for each.  So this pull request changes the static data member \"vertexoffset\" to a non-static data member vertexOffset_.\n\nThis pull request also declares the static DigiAccumulatorMixModFactory::singleInstance_  to be const.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1382911675", "comments": 7, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1382727112", "deletions": 15, "labels": ["fully-signed", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "ccc1791276fe27349e5bf6ff40ba8d2eaa295a5b", "merged_at": "1382911675", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_0_0_pre8", "number": 1189, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Make a static data member non-static and declare another static const.", "updated_at": "1406903337", "user": "wmtan"}

It was checked that all newly added dependencies are actually required by the package with `git grep`.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 16, "closed_at": "1600958252", "comments": 22, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1600728593", "deletions": 13, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "36f9c81568a288dfee63bf55d657e444494c181d", "merged_at": "1600958252", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 31533, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "Clean BuildFiles in Reco", "updated_at": "1600958252", "user": "guitargeek"}

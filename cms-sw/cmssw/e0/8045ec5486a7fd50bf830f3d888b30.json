The other `testTF*CUDA` tests were passing silently using the CPU to run the test.  After this PR all the TF sessions using  `tf::backend::cuda` , but  not finding a GPU will fail explicitly. \r\n\r\n- This PR is needed to continue the integration of CUDA 12.4 in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmsdist/pull/9046. \r\n- This PR needs https://github.com/cms-sw/cmsdist/pull/9066 (thanks to @smuzaffar https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/44376#issuecomment-1992693414)\r\n- This PR is a backport of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/44376", "branch": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 4, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1710239027", "deletions": 7, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "hold", "ml-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "number": 44375, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[backport] Improve handling of TF CUDA tests for 14_0_X", "updated_at": "1710790601", "user": "valsdav"}

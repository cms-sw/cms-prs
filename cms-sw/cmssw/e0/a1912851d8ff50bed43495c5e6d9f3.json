Modified files are:\r\n\r\n   * RecoTauTag/Configuration/python/loadRecoTauTagMVAsFromPrepDB_cfi.py\r\n   *  RecoTauTag/Configuration/python/updateHPSPFTaus.py\r\n   *  PhysicsTools/PatAlgos/python/slimming/miniAOD_tools.py\r\n\r\nThis modification impacts both the standard and legacy80X workflows via an updated makePatTausTask.\r\n\r\nIn addition the protection to prevent the PATTauProducer from asserting when encountering requests for tauID WP that are not available on existing AOD, has been backported from 100X (*). Changed files are: \r\n\r\n   *  PhysicsTools/PatAlgos/plugins/PATTauProducer.cc\r\n   *  PhysicsTools/PatAlgos/plugins/PATTauProducer.h\r\n   *  PhysicsTools/PatAlgos/python/producersLayer1/tauProducer_cfi.py\r\n\r\nThe development has been made by @mbluj. \r\n\r\nThe changes wrt to status quo are in the mvaTauID output only. Performance comparisons and more detailed comments can be checked from here (**)\r\n\r\nPlease consider this PR for reminiAODv2. \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nRoger\r\n\r\n(*)\r\nhttps://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/21186\r\n\r\n(**)\r\nhttps://github.com/cms-tau-pog/cmssw/pull/71", "branch": "CMSSW_9_4_MAOD_X", "changed_files": 9, "comments": 69, "commits": 30, "created_at": "1516982106", "deletions": 36, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-pending", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_9_4_MAOD_X", "number": 21977, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 13, "state": "open", "title": "New trainings for mvaTauID + one backport from CMSSW_10_0_X", "updated_at": "1518780845", "user": "roger-wolf"}

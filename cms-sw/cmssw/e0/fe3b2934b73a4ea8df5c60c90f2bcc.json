This required modifying the SiStripClusterInfo helper class.\r\n\r\nModified all the other clients of SiStripClusterInfo also to keep working with the changes in the helper class, but I didn't finish the migration for those other modules because I am not sure which are actually still used. But the part using SiStripClusterInfo is migrated now.\r\n\r\nNote that I deleted the reclusterize function from SiStripClusterInfo. Nothing in the repository used that function and it seemed an odd place to run clusterization from anyway. I deleted it because the reclusterize function used EventSetup and removing that postpones the EventSetup consumes migration of that algorithm until we migrate the module that actually runs it.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRelies on existing tests. There is no new functionality. All results should be identical if I've done this correctly.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 15, "closed_at": "1578678950", "comments": 27, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1577384638", "deletions": 328, "labels": ["alca-approved", "analysis-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "266a6c7a8fca06652ca0e6139cb63fed1b8a9d2f", "merged_at": "1578678950", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 28683, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "EventSetup consumes migration, SiStrip modules", "updated_at": "1578678950", "user": "wddgit"}

This is necessary because the database expects vectors of a fixed size (even if the information in some entries is meaningless) whereas with the old approach the size could vary.\n\nThere is also a very small fix to the multithreading. A more thorough revision of the latter will be done after the mid-week global run.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_2_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1417597655", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1417394932", "deletions": 247, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "hlt-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "c31784f8a4242a12bbbf4d9327617b2ef3d55a8b", "merged_at": "1417597655", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_2_X", "number": 6704, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Correcting L1 trigger printout and multithreading", "updated_at": "1417597655", "user": "avetisya"}

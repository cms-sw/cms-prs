There are no changes expected.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\n\r\nNo backport intended.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 38, "closed_at": "1567449112", "comments": 50, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1563202997", "deletions": 858, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "5c3f56ee0db7642e67bdab5530e0781a1fbcec80", "merged_at": "1567449112", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27522, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "New GsfEleEBEECut class to generalize some ElectronIdentification cuts", "updated_at": "1567449242", "user": "guitargeek"}

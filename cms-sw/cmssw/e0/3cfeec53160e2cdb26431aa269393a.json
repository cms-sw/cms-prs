Users won't have to switch manually the input tag to  slimmedMET__RECO anymore\n\nChanges expected :\n- gain of CPU performances\n- physics untouched, rounding of PFcandidate quantities removed from the computations.\n\nHas to be done on top of #11482 \n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": "1444457678", "comments": 7, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1443179553", "deletions": 33, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "5987bacf5100886b562602736e7c1d9d1b4f8cfc", "merged_at": "1444457678", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 11489, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "Disabling the reclustering in the MET correction and uncertainty tool", "updated_at": "1479107016", "user": "mmarionncern"}

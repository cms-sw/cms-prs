If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nTo be backported to 14.0.x to fix the same bug there.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 36, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1720002820", "deletions": 21, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "bug-fix", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-approved", "heterogeneous-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 45368, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Fix CachingAllocator debug for non-async operations", "updated_at": "1720123742", "user": "fwyzard"}

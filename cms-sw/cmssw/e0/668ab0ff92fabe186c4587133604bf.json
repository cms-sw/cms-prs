There was a subtle bug that only the first EncodedEventId was stored. Another bug has also been fixed where the fraction of individual contribution to the digi was calculated wrongly. A few new histograms are added in the validation suite and a few minor bugs corrected.\r\n\r\nDetailed description of the update reported in Tracker Phase2 Simulation meeting can be found here\r\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/536892/contributions/2385404/attachments/1379749/2096939/DigiStudy_Status_Nov29_2016.pdf\r\n\r\n@delaere @atricomi @boudoul @emiglior ", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 10, "closed_at": "1481196849", "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1480520127", "deletions": 116, "labels": ["comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 16822, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Phase2Digitizer package updated", "updated_at": "1481196849", "user": "suchandradutta"}

But the gun could also be used more generally with arbitrary minimum and maximum pT values. \r\nThe exponentially falling distribution is needed because the production cross section of the eta meson falls off rapidly with increasing pT, so much more statistics is needed at lower pT values (but only above the acceptance threshold).\r\n\r\nIt is just adding a new Pt gun, so output of existing code will not change.\r\nJIRA ticket where this PR is requested: https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSBPHMC-52\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\ncode-checks, code-format, and runTheMatrix.py were all run successfully.\r\nThe new plugin was also tested thoroughly and successfully used to produce EtaTo2Mu2Gamma events in CMSSW_12_4_17 and CMSSW_13_0_14.\r\n\r\nIf this PR is accepted I will open a backport for CMSSW_12_4_X for Summer22 production.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1700624229", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["generators-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "number": 43354, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "adding Py8 Pt Gun with exponentially falling pT distribution", "updated_at": "1700624621", "user": "bennettgberg"}

Highlights include:\r\n\r\n* @jkarancs `SiPixelCoordinates`, which is used to add the \"PixelMap\" type plots. Very rough for now, but looks good.\r\n* More changes to the DQM contents and organization, due to @fioriNTU and myself.\r\n* Improved `SiPixelPhase1TrackEfficiency` plugin. Now uses `TProfile` to do the efficiency computation (thanks to @jkarancs again for this trick!) and no more harvesting step is needed. Also does a bit more track propagation now. Per-ROC efficiency exists now but has to be validated.\r\n* Consequently, the \"custom harvesting\" functionality was removed from the `HistogramManager`. Nobody (including myself) understood how to use it anyways.\r\n* Various bugfixes around the `SpecificationBuilder`. It now can serve as a useful piece of documentation on how the Phase1 DQM really works.\r\n* Improved test config in `SiPixelPhase1Config/test`, now does Tracking and Pixel offline DQM, while still running much faster than runTheMatrix and with online GUI/live support.\r\n\r\nThis work is based on the 2016-12-14 IB, since some later version broke reading 810 or pre1 RelVal files. Maybe just needs some config flags but easier to test on the old version.\r\n\r\nRecipe here: https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/PixelDQMPhaseI#A_Phase1_MC_Data_online_setup\r\n\r\nCC @davidcarbonis @lunik1 @leggat ", "branch": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "changed_files": 31, "closed_at": "1484839411", "comments": 12, "commits": 18, "created_at": "1482314461", "deletions": 576, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "number": 17089, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "Phase1 Pixel DQM Christmas Version", "updated_at": "1484839412", "user": "schneiml"}

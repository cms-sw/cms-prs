The previous version of the code was still using old collection names for AOD data used in the 2018 PbPb run. This update changes the names of the collections to correspond to that in the miniAOD datasets, which will be used for 2023 PbPb run and are already used for the 2018 miniAODs.\r\n\r\nIn addition to updating the collection names, the flow modulation produces has been rewritten in a way that allows for more configuration with Python configuration files. This will allow for extended studies to improve the parameters for flow modulated CS jets.\r\n\r\nAlso a minor bug is fixed for CSJetProducer, where the minimum jet pT cut was not applied correctly. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis code has been used for a few months in the internal heavy ion forest branch, and it has been working without problems. I have checked that the code compiles with the build CMSSW_13_2_X_2023-06-07-1100 and that heavy ion related tests are successful with runTheMatrix command. Before making the pull request, I have also run the commands\r\n\r\nscram build code-format\r\nscram build code-checks\r\n\r\nto ensure code is formatted and working properly.\r\n\r\n@mandrenguyen \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 9, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1686166928", "deletions": 82, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_2_X", "number": 41897, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 26, "state": "open", "title": "Heavy ions: Added flow modulated CS jets for miniAOD data", "updated_at": "1686664642", "user": "jusaviin"}

To make sure that these sources are not compiled twice, a OnlineDB/CSCCondDB library build target is introduced that is now used both by the plugins and the test library. I hope this is a fair solution!\r\n\r\nAs always, only the dependencies which are **not included in any of the sources** are removed, so these changes are orthogonal and complementary to the recent PRs which added all packages that are **actually included**.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCMSSW compiles. It was checked that all newly added dependencies are actually required by the package with `git grep`.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 9, "closed_at": "1604420884", "comments": 20, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1603400056", "deletions": 123, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "db-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "536c306a7e8f110332ce5d6bf955b9ad16724f2c", "merged_at": "1604420884", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 31912, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Clean BuildFiles in OnlineDB/CSCCondDB", "updated_at": "1604420885", "user": "guitargeek"}

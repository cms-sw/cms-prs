The output root file correctly has the requested generator filter information stored.\r\n\r\nFollowing rebasing on the latest master branch, the code has passes the nanoAOD unit tests that run over data (`runTheMatrix.py -l 136.8523`) in the latest IB _CMSSW_12_0_X_2021-06-17-1100_. The MC equivalent (`runTheMatrix.py -l 1325.81`) and `scram b runtests` fail due to a DAS error not being able to access the file. I believe it would still important to inspect the output of the nanoAOD MC unit tests.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "comments": 21, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1623940340", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "xpog-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "number": 34169, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 15, "state": "open", "title": "Storing Generator Filter Information in NanoAOD", "updated_at": "1631684529", "user": "mzarucki"}

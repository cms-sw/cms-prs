The DeepCoreSeedGenerator.cc file is updated with the new model path as well as new prediction thresholds. This PR depends on [another PR](https://github.com/cms-data/RecoTracker-TkSeedGenerator) (which I will make following this one), which will add the DeepCore 2.2.1 model.\r\n\r\nRelevant Links:\r\n\r\n- [Track POG Update 09/11/2023](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1315747/contributions/5553878/attachments/2712109/4709601/DeepCore_TrackPOG_23_0911.pdf)\r\n- [DeepCore 2 Website](https://hboucham.web.cern.ch) (includes testing workflows and documentation)\r\n- [DeepCore 2 repository](https://github.com/bouchamaouihichem/DeepCore)\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nWorkflows 11923.17/0 and 11834.17/0.

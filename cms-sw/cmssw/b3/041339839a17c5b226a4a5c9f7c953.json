For \"Lpx\" it was already correct. The correction was suggested by J. Kaspar.\r\n\r\nAt line 174 the slope parameter \"a\" has been update to 2.66 instead of 0.42. The simple calculation is\r\n\r\n             a = delta(dLy/ds) / delta(xi) = (0.24) / (0.14 - 0.05 ) = 2.66 \r\n\r\nthe change of the uncertainty band with xi (the 0.24 means 24 percent xi change from 5 to 14 % xi) .

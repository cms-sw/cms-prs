This cryptic assert could also occur for other reasons.\nThis simple PR replaces the cryptic assert with an informative exception, which in the above case is a missing dictionary exception. This PR also fixes another minor problem. If TypeWithDict::name() or any related function was used to get the name of a class that has no dictionary, \"dummyType\" was returned, rather than the correct name of the class.\nThis problem is ROOT6 specific, but it also occurs in CMSSW_7_5_X. This fix can be back ported to 7_5_X if needed. This problem does not directly affect 7_4_X.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1444362973", "comments": 10, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1444335265", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["comparison-available", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "6403a99c6f381077942df951869b080c0d3287e2", "merged_at": "1444362973", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 11703, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Replace cryptic assert with informative exception for missing Wrapper dictionary", "updated_at": "1444832736", "user": "wmtan"}

Point (1) should have no impact at all.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1515762700", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_0_X", "number": 21840, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[HCAL] Bug fix for 8 vs 10 TS in Mahi reconstruction", "updated_at": "1515769518", "user": "jaylawhorn"}

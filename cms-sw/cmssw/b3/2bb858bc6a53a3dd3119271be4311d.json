Point (1) should have no impact at all.~~\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1516179593", "comments": 37, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1515762700", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "a18f676439fd3d6ee655ef53d3eca5dd4d364c1e", "merged_at": "1516179593", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_0_X", "number": 21840, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "[HCAL] Bug fix and default configuration change for Mahi reconstruction", "updated_at": "1516179593", "user": "jaylawhorn"}

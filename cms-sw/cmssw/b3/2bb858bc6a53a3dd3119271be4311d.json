Point (1) should have no impact at all.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 21, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1515762700", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_0_X", "number": 21840, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "open", "title": "[HCAL] Bug fix and default configuration change for Mahi reconstruction", "updated_at": "1515976887", "user": "jaylawhorn"}

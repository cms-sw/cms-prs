I also replaced `[]` with `at()` and added a few assert statements. The bug was introduced when the pad numbering in GE1/1 was changed from 1->192 to 0->191, and in GE2/1 from 1->384 to 0->383.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested on 4000 events in Run-3 sample `/DYToLL_M-50_TuneCP5_14TeV-pythia8/Run3Winter20DRMiniAOD-DRFlatPU30to80_110X_mcRun3_2021_realistic_v6-v2/GEN-SIM-RAW`.

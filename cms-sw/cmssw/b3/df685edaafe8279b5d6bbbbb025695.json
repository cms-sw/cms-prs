If #23012 is applied on top, this should have a small effect.)", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1526279937", "comments": 41, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1525290299", "deletions": 290, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "orp-approved", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "a7262cb64a9164059a17c3877a3c3895d200bcb6", "merged_at": "1526279937", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 23120, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 4, "state": "closed", "title": "Implement jet ID for PUPPI jets", "updated_at": "1526279938", "user": "ahinzmann"}

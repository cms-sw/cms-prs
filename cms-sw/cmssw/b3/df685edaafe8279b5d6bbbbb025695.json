If #23012 is applied on top, this should have a small effect.)", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 13, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1525290299", "deletions": 32, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 23120, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "open", "title": "Implement jet ID for PUPPI jets", "updated_at": "1525361042", "user": "ahinzmann"}

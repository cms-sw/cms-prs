Incidentally, the ME0Segment size should be smaller now since we were unnecessarily keeping other variables with double precision. I added the computer as a static function that takes Points/Vectors as inputs. This is for matching to pixel tracks to segments, so that one can use the projected track's properties and get the proper Dphi. \r\n\r\n2) Add central BX association\r\nWe have required that the ME0Segment is associated to the central BX in all studies, but did not apply it on the ME0Segment producing stage. However, these segments will be used a few times in the global muon reconstruction, so we thought it is best to filter out the bad segments here.\r\n\r\n3) Default segment parameters\r\nThe parameters have been updated to match the baseline TDR granularity: 8 eta partitions/384 strips\r\n\r\n++ one bug fix:\r\nA change in the ME0Chamber geometry code:\r\nThe layer() functions were not working correctly...they iterated over layers but checked eta partition numbers.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 10, "closed_at": "1491458137", "comments": 54, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1490820123", "deletions": 49, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "aba61afb13bb3d8332a5034df52433b0aec7bea2", "merged_at": "1491458137", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_1_X", "number": 18127, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 32, "state": "closed", "title": "ME0Segment update for muon tdr samples", "updated_at": "1491458137", "user": "nickmccoll"}

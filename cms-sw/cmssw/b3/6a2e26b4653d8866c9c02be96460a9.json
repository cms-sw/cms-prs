This addition allows the usage of a single contiguous chunk of memory to store different types (as an example, two ```double```s and two ```float```s).\r\nThis PR has no dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nThe functions were successfully tested within CMSSW with a producer yet to be released, but the code can be provided upon request.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1589449132", "comments": 29, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1586273397", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "heterogeneous-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 29408, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add functions for memory allocation on a single byte basis", "updated_at": "1589449143", "user": "b-fontana"}

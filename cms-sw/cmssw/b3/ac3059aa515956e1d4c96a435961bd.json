It follows changes introduced by #24800.\r\nIn addition, this PR adds a switch to remove/keep tau candidates in the EB-EE crack regions (|eta|~1.5). Those regions are covered by the new training (but not by the old one) to allow recovery of efficiency. By default the switch is set to value recovering previous behavior (removal of candidates in EB-EE cracks) thus this does not breaks backward compatibility.\r\nWe intend to backport this PR to 102X and 94X to be used in Run-2 analyses and be included to NanoAOD with 102X (different PR via NanoAOD repo will be prepared).

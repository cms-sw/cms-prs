This is currently done using an utility in `EventFilter/Utilities`, which has been enhanced for this scope.\nFrom this information, the Physics Declared bit is computed, and added into the report summary profile.\nNOTA BENE: this is a **temporary** solution, until a well implemented unpacker for TCDS is made available in CMSSW.\n\nThe PR also resurrects a `MonitorElement` in `DQMEventInfo` showing the HLT path selection in the DQM input source `DQMStreamerReader`.\n\nAutomatically ported from CMSSW_8_1_X #14763 (original by @diguida).\nAutomatically ported from CMSSW_9_0_X #16648 (original by @diguida).\nPlease wait for a new IB (12 to 24H) before requesting to test this PR.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 11, "closed_at": "1490265569", "comments": 10, "commits": 10, "created_at": "1488454714", "deletions": 415, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "daq-pending", "dqm-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_9_1_X", "number": 17737, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Revive beam information, physics declared bit, and HLT event selection for online DQM 81X", "updated_at": "1490265569", "user": "cmsbuild"}

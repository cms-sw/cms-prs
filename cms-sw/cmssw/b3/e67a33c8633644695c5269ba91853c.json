This leaves the SubProcess feature completely disabled so it can no longer be run. Subsequent PRs will remove other code related to SubProcess from the Framework. Everything except the support for module sharing in EventSetup will eventually be removed. Most, maybe all, of the remaining code to be deleted is C++ code.\r\n\r\nThis PR also removes all the code related to unit tests of the SubProcess feature, including test modules and test data types only used for the SubProcess tests. Some tests are entirely removed. Some tests include parts that test SubProcess and some parts that test other things and those are only partially removed.\r\n\r\nMatti announced that this change was coming here: https://cms-talk.web.cern.ch/t/removal-of-subprocess-feature/117449 and also in the O&C meeting a few weeks ago. We received no feedback or complaints.\r\n\r\nResolves https://github.com/cms-sw/framework-team/issues/1278\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRelies on existing tests. This does not include any new functionality.  Mostly it is deletions.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 54, "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1741718062", "deletions": 14606, "labels": ["core-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-rejected", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 47565, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Remove configuration support for SubProcess and its tests", "updated_at": "1741731896", "user": "wddgit"}

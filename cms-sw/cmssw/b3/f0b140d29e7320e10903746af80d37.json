The default is to use the old calculation and for Run3_2024 Eras and beyond to use the new calculation.\r\n\r\nAs a note, this does introduce a modifier file I have created personally, I don't know if there is a standard for who can create these or when they should be made, and it is introduced to the Run3_2024 era.\r\n\r\n@slaurila @eyigitba: FYI\r\n\r\n### PR validation:\r\n\r\nAll code compiles and has had formatting applied. The settings+flag has been tested in L1 re-emulation under different eras to trigger the correct quality calculation.\r\n\r\n### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

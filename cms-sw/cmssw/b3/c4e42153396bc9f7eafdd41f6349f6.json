I've added the `typedef SimpleFlatTableProducer<l1t::PFJet> SimpleTriggerL1PFJetFlatTableProducer` and then used it for the new table in order to access the `getTagScore` method that was introduced in #47798 to `l1t::PFJet`. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis PR has been used to produce L1Nano ntuples and passed through the standalone menu tools to validate the PR and the object collection. Here's one example plot below, with more plots available [here](https://ssummers.web.cern.ch/CMS/TauJetsMET/V44NGJetDev/).\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://ssummers.web.cern.ch/CMS/TauJetsMET/V44NGJetDev/rates/V44NGJetDev_Online_JetDefaultRates.png\" width=\"400\" />\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1746446282", "deletions": 10, "labels": ["l1-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "xpog-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 48010, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Add L1TSC4NGJets to Phase2L1TNanoAOD", "updated_at": "1747051937", "user": "thesps"}

I've added the `typedef SimpleFlatTableProducer<l1t::PFJet> SimpleTriggerL1PFJetFlatTableProducer` and then used it for the new table in order to access the `getTagScore` method that was introduced in #47798 to `l1t::PFJet`. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis PR has been used to produce L1Nano ntuples and passed through the standalone menu tools to validate the PR and the object collection.

It will show differences down to the level of |1.e-23|. This PR adds the option to reduce the precision of comparison to |1.e-7| to allow focusing on big differences without being overwhelmed with tiny numerical fluctuations.\r\nAlso, values in simulation geometry that are shown to four decimal places are rounded to zero if they are < |5.e-5| to avoid showing differences between 0.0000 and -0.0000, which are not very helpful.\r\n\r\nThese scripts are for expert use and have no effect on production workflows.\r\n\r\nNo backport is needed.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 12, "closed_at": "1599302081", "comments": 23, "commits": 12, "created_at": "1598991294", "deletions": 55, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "5b767dedc3bd1e82775f1211d5ef82eddef3b80c", "merged_at": "1599302081", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 31320, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "Small enhancements to geometry DB payload validation scripts", "updated_at": "1599302081", "user": "cvuosalo"}

Further code is added to avoid edge cases where weight names are missing in the header (possibly caused by these names being put in by hand). \r\n\r\nFor more discussion, look [at this discussion](https://github.com/cms-nanoAOD/cmssw/issues/546) as well as the comments from [this PR on a different branch](https://github.com/kdlong/cmssw/pull/35)\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n[Here is a list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Qlg1c6qrMGY0q111Va2Vl0fJQUz15ZTjKEvRaV8rHaQ/edit#gid=0) of files that were tested on. The code was tested in two different modes: `keepAllPSWeights=True` and `keepAllPSWeights=False` (ie only store 4 main variations).\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1604917074", "comments": 21, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1603958843", "deletions": 77, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "generators-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved", "xpog-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "317bd9457b7e3ae8d3255d966ae0ab60647beb48", "merged_at": "1604917073", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 31982, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix PSWeights in LumiHeader to work w diff pythia format", "updated_at": "1605119422", "user": "dteague"}

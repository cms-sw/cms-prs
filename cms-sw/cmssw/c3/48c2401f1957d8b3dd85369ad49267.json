There was no new functionality added to the `DeepMETProducer` per se, so existing test cases should still fully apply.\r\n\r\n@clacaputo @yongbinfeng @valsdav", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1670921960", "comments": 7, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1670691963", "deletions": 26, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "39394a2c91eba54f396c5e454c87403b89797d52", "merged_at": "1670921960", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "number": 40284, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Move TF session in DeepMETProducer to global cache", "updated_at": "1670928035", "user": "riga"}

There was no new functionality added to the `DeepMETProducer` per so, so existing test cases should still fully apply.\r\n\r\n@clacaputo @yongbinfeng @valsdav", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "comments": 2, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1670691963", "deletions": 26, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "number": 40284, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Move TF session in DeepMETProducer to global cache", "updated_at": "1670692566", "user": "riga"}

This is actually a valid input.\r\n\r\nFastCircle::isLine method is added to make the simple test.\r\n\r\nThere is no change to the physics results of the algorithms. A LogWarning is simply not issued anymore in the case that appears to already have a correct behavior.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1526635066", "comments": 11, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1526408512", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "58fdc16c235eced3453513fefb3118f0d3cf5c89", "merged_at": "1526635066", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 23209, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 6, "state": "closed", "title": "reduce cases of LogWarnings with InvalidHelix category in Pixel/Strip ClusterShape compatibility checks", "updated_at": "1526635066", "user": "slava77"}

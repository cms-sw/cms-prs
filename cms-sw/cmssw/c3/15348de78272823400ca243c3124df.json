The monitoring histograms have been implemented in the new code re-engineered to be compliant with the multi-thread environment (SiStripGainsPCLWorker and SiStripGainsPCLHarvester) and in the decommissioned class (SiStripGainFromCalibTree) which will be kept active as a backup in the case of the PCL workflow failure.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 11, "closed_at": "1496313802", "comments": 51, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1493641202", "deletions": 122, "labels": ["alca-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "50e98c4a71bb00a763c4298a4dbc8533cfcd2332", "merged_at": "1496313802", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_2_X", "number": 18531, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 19, "state": "closed", "title": "DQM quality monitor for SiStrip Gain (G2) from Multi Run Harvesting ", "updated_at": "1496313802", "user": "dimattia"}

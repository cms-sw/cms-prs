In addition, it is useful to view these events in a wider time window than the default configuration. This PR changes the timing windows and removes a chi-square constraint to make DQM more useful during splash events. This is not meant to be merged into CMSSW.\r\n\r\nThis PR is based on top of the recent PR#18467 ( https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/18467 ) to ensure no issues while merging in production.\r\n\r\nLink to Deployment PR: https://github.com/dmwm/deployment/pull/471", "branch": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1493286573", "comments": 2, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1493214230", "deletions": 12, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "dqm-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "number": 18480, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "(Do not merge) Special timing window configuration for splash events", "updated_at": "1493286573", "user": "tanmaymudholkar"}

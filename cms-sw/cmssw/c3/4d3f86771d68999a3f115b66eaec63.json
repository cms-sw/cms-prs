The idea is to call the actual CMSSW functions that are used in the pixel calibrations procedure rather than separately coded versions of them (like was done previously). To do this we needed to modify the objects and code structure a bit. The most significant changes are adding a sideload() function to SiPixelTemplate object to allow loading of partial templates, and moving the generic_position_formula() to a separate file.\r\n\r\nThese changes are all internal to the pixel code and we expect no changes in output.\r\n\r\nWe have tested by running the tracking validation and seeing that the PR makes no difference in the output at all.\r\n\r\nSlides about this were shown in the pixel offline meeting.

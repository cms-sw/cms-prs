Two separate models were developed: one for trackster energy regression and another for particle ID. These models are integrated into different reconstruction steps, specifically CLU3D (pattern recognition) and trackster linking. The models are saved in ONNX format to optimize processing time.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we have moved the inference to the TracksterProducer and TracksterLinksProducer, instead of running the inference within the algorithm. This was achieved by creating a new TICL inference plugin system, which allows for the inclusion of more models without conflicting with the old ones. We have also converted the old TensorFlow model of TICLv4 used for PID and regression to ONNX format and created a separate inference plugin, TracksterInferenceByCNNv4.\r\n\r\n-This PR needs to be tested with the following cms-data PR: [cms-data/RecoHGCal-TICL#6](https://github.com/cms-data/RecoHGCal-TICL/pull/6).\r\n\r\n`-Additionally,` this PR should be tested on the .203 workflow : \r\n\r\n-test parameters:\r\n    workflow_opts= -w upgrade\r\n    workflow = 29888.203,29688.203\r\n\r\n\r\nTagging @felicepantaleo @waredjeb @hatakeyamak ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 28, "comments": 42, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1724834188", "deletions": 807, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "hlt-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "upgrade-pending", "requires-external", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_2_X", "number": 45821, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 21, "state": "open", "title": "Refactoring of TICL EnergyRegression and PID model", "updated_at": "1726341395", "user": "Moanwar"}

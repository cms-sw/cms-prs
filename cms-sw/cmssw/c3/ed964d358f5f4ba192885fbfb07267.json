From the discussion we had at the Muon POG, these variables will be enough for implementing VXBS constraint on any kind of muon track.\r\n\r\nThe error on dxyBS looks similar enough with the error on dxy, which you can see in the attached plot. In the plot the blue curve is error on dxy and red one is error on dxyBS. So if everyone agrees we can drop the error on dxyBs.\r\n[dxybsErr_data.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17278706/dxybsErr_data.pdf)\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 19, "commits": 9, "created_at": "1728298647", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending", "xpog-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_2_X", "number": 46287, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "VXBS For High Pt", "updated_at": "1729840290", "user": "rbhattacharya04"}

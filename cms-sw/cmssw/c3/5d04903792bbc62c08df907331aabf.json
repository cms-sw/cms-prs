This PR removes the alpaka procModifier from these workflows. One workflow is completely removed, as it was duplicate of another, and that leads to a small change in the workflow numbering.\r\n\r\nThe PR was validated by making sure that all the modified workflows succeed.\r\n\r\nFYI @rovere and @waredjeb: Since the `alpaka` procModifier is used in Phase 2 HLT to enable the HGCal heterogeneous reconstruction, I wanted to ask whether it is useful to keep it in any of the modified workflows.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 17, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1767982049", "deletions": 75, "labels": ["hlt-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_1_X", "number": 49755, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Remove alpaka procModfier from workflows in which it is no longer useful", "updated_at": "1768471192", "user": "VourMa"}

This [draft PR](https://github.com/cms-hls4ml/TOPO/pull/1) contains the current hls model. \r\n- Run-3 Deployment of the topological trigger is targeted for early 2026\r\n- The lastest [talk](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1506588/timetable/?view=standard_inline_minutes#47-machine-learning-based-topo) summarises the technical details of the latest model\r\n\r\n\r\n**PR validation**\r\nthe final dnn score outputted by the cms-sw L1 emulator agrees well with the keras model training in a python environment. At relevant scores above 0.8, only deviations of the order two percent are expected: \r\n<img width=\"1431\" height=\"1101\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/91257300-11d3-4897-bb0a-559cf8c0e54d\" />", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 15, "comments": 10, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1760017225", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["l1-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "changes-dataformats"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_0_X", "number": 49119, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 9, "state": "open", "title": "L1 emulator of topological trigger for cms-sw", "updated_at": "1760997237", "user": "LukasEbeling"}

To map one photon / electron to another, their supercluster seed ID is used. \r\n\r\nA better solution would be that nano rather than reinventing the wheel, retrieves the objects from from the pat::Electrons of mini directly and doesnt mess around with value maps, this is how EGM intended this to be used.  But that is out side the scope of this PR. \r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nwhen testing the workflow runTheMatrix.py -l 11634.0, it now works and ids are being produced as expected. \r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1658681341", "comments": 14, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1658394497", "deletions": 35, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved", "xpog-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "aec4aadd2a6f06a36726204999b9c834cf215c66", "merged_at": "1658681341", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 38810, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Allowing EGM IDs to run in Mini with  Nano workflows ", "updated_at": "1658681342", "user": "Sam-Harper"}

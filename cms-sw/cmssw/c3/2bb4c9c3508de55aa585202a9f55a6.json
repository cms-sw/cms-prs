Since some of those offline-jet collections aren't available in HIon wfs, this leads to exceptions due to missing products in such wfs of the HLT-Validation tests.\r\n\r\nThis PR provides a fix. If needed, a better solution will be provided by experts in the near future (see discussion at the end of #38748).\r\n\r\nSome of the config files introduced in #38748 are re-organised in `cfi`s and `cff`s for clarity.\r\n\r\nNo changes are expected in the outputs of PR tests, modulo https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/39051#discussion_r945174984.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTSG tests.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

It is possible to disable this, but only at config level and not from cmsDriver. This PR adds a function to be passed to cmsDriver with the `--customise` flag.\r\nThis is required to run the step3 on older files, which is needed by some groups.\r\nThe command that first triggered this issue was \r\n```\r\ncmsDriver.py step3 --filein root://cms-xrd-global.cern.ch//store/mc/Run3Winter21DRMiniAOD/DYToLL_M-50_TuneCP5_14TeV-pythia8/GEN-SIM-DIGI-RAW/FlatPU30to80FEVT_112X_mcRun3_2021_realistic_v16-v2/270024/72e988b6-0ffe-401f-bf81-5ae5c722e5f3.root  --fileout file:step3.root --mc --eventcontent AODSIM --datatier AODSIM --conditions 120X_mcRun3_2021_realistic_v9 --step RAW2DIGI,RECO,RECOSIM,EI --nThreads 4 --era Run3 --python_filename MC_step3_Run3Trigger_120X_cfg.py --no_exec --customise Configuration/DataProcessing/Utils.addMonitoring -n 10\r\n```\r\nin 12_0_X, which now works.\r\nAfter this PR is accepted we will also require a backport for that release.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nChecked on a cmsDriver invocation that the resulting process has the correct flags set\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nNot a backport, but will be backported later.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1636245911", "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1636126064", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["simulation-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "62ff32de975ba62847cdb88818f00525451ae91f", "merged_at": "1636245911", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_2_X", "number": 36011, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add a configuration function to disable track-gen matching in step3 from cmsDriver", "updated_at": "1636245911", "user": "elusian"}

These will be replaced with a new GT when ready.\r\n\r\nOther minor changes:\r\n* Update era usage in cosmic 2017 workflow\r\n* Apply layer0 weight (NDF simulation) in digitization step by default (except for phase2, temporarily)\r\n\r\nattn: @abdoulline, @hatakeyamak, @deguio, @franzoni, @ianna, @bsunanda, @igv4321", "branch": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "changed_files": 16, "closed_at": "1488008218", "comments": 120, "commits": 11, "created_at": "1487774554", "deletions": 15, "labels": ["alca-pending", "comparison-available", "hold", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-pending", "tests-approved", "upgrade-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "dc2ac09794e341369aa541bf3fbb6b01346ee736", "merged_at": "1488008218", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "number": 17605, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 6, "state": "closed", "title": "HE Plan1 workflow for 2017", "updated_at": "1488053494", "user": "kpedro88"}

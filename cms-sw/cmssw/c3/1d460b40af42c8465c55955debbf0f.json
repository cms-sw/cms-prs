In the interest of time, for now I've made the minimal change needed, only in  `PhysicsTools/NanoAOD` package, to make it work. But after discussions with Sam it seems that it would be useful to add these important variables directly to `DataFormats/EgammaReco/interface/SuperCluster.h`. In that case, accessing those variables from nano cff files will be easier, and there won't be any need of a new producer. And it would be more user-friendly for analysers whose setup is based on miniAOD. However, this approach needs some more time to converge. We will revisit it in near future. But for the immediate rush of 12_6_X renano, the current approach is sufficient.

I'm citing Michal's comments (*) and refer to him for further questions.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nRoger\r\n\r\n(*)\r\nThis PR is to modify the Cone-based tau builder (used at HLT) to fill some additional data members of produced PFTau not filled so far:\r\n\r\n    Size of signal cone (cone for PiZeros used);\r\n    Pt carried by signal PiZeros outside of the signal cone; it is important shape variable supporting isolation in rejecting jet->tau fakes;\r\n    Charge, pdgId, tau decay mode hypothesis.\r\n\r\nThe changes do not modify current HLT work-flow (the builder is used only at HLT), but provides new features (cf. 2) allowing better jet->tau fake rejection during 2017 data-taking.\r\n\r\nThis is PR to 91X on top of changes proposed for tau vertex association (cf. https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/18243), a separate PR for 90X will follow shortly.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1493961886", "comments": 65, "commits": 14, "created_at": "1492721370", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "hlt-approved", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "abdea551d52e2a4395255eddb507adbe484bb863", "merged_at": "1493961886", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_2_X", "number": 18429, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 10, "state": "closed", "title": "Modification of cone based tau algorithm to furbish it as fallback solution for the HLT for upcoming data taking", "updated_at": "1493966230", "user": "roger-wolf"}

Screenshot is attached below and shows that the variable is correctly filled. The config and the output can be found in CERN AFS at the path /afs/cern.ch/work/a/asahasra/public/ScoutingStudy/For2024ScoutingEGUpdate/TestSecondRoundOfCommits/CMSSW_14_0_0_pre3/src and are named as configHLT1330V22Fbrem_ScoutingPF.py and outputHLT1330V22Fbrem_ScoutingPF.root respectively. \r\n - The relevant for the customisation for the menu is at the path /afs/cern.ch/work/a/asahasra/public/ScoutingStudy/For2024ScoutingEGUpdate/TestSecondRoundOfCommits/CMSSW_14_0_0_pre3/src/HLTrigger/Configuration/python/customizeHLTforScouting.py.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1510\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/assets/32368439/c3f55f61-31d5-49a0-a71e-4374361b935d\">\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1707316726", "comments": 20, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1707158118", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["hlt-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "bug-fix", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "4583435314bce865d9e7744f00d6969dcd4e1584", "merged_at": "1707316726", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 43873, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "Implement the GSF Track fBrem Variable Filling for Scouting Electrons: 14_1", "updated_at": "1707316727", "user": "arsahasransu"}

Unfortunately the prescaleWeightProvider seems not to be working at the moment due to a problem with l1GtTriggerMenuLite, so the change will only have effect once the problem is fixed. For the moment, all weights are equal to 1 and no change will be visible in the efficiency plots", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1510306591", "comments": 17, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1508168132", "deletions": 69, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "hold", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_0_X", "number": 20930, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Correct prescales", "updated_at": "1510306591", "user": "defranchis"}

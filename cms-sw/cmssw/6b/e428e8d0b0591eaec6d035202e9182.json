This includes deleting some ancient geometries that used the old FPIX. See discussion there. (Rebased to CMSSW_8_1_X_2016-10-07-2300 to ease testing.)\n- #16148 updates the FPIX xml files that were moved around above, leading to conflicts. I cherry-picked the single commit here and fixed the conflicts, this seems to be the easiest way.\n#15986 can still be disputed; in that case only #16148 should be merged. But if we want both changes in, this is the PR to use.\n\n(also @tmulholland , @veszpv , @friccita )\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 50, "closed_at": "1476582410", "comments": 15, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1475906481", "deletions": 6029, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-available", "geometry-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "ef57affc2a641c11def5bdfb9e3d713a465d7ca5", "merged_at": "1476582410", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 16149, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Remove old FPIX; make New FPIX default, and update FPIX materials", "updated_at": "1476595715", "user": "schneiml"}

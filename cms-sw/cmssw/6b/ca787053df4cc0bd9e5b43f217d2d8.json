Need a free machine to make definitive tests.\r\n\r\nSome cleanup is still required to remove debug statements.\r\n\r\nPurely technical no regression expected.\r\n\r\nDraft Slides for a possible presentation available @ https://cernbox.cern.ch/index.php/s/Ax4NHYGLHbG8N1C", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 49, "comments": 63, "commits": 39, "created_at": "1652615854", "deletions": 737, "labels": ["alca-rejected", "reconstruction-rejected", "pending-signatures", "tests-rejected", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "heterogeneous-pending", "tracking", "trk", "changes-dataformats"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 37952, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 64, "state": "open", "title": " New Heterogeneous Memory Pool", "updated_at": "1757480086", "user": "VinInn"}

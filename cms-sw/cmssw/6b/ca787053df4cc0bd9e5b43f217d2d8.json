Need a free machine to make definitive tests.\r\n\r\nSome cleanup is still required to remove debug statements.\r\n\r\nPurely technical no regression expected.\r\n\r\nDraft Slides for a possible presentation available @ https://cernbox.cern.ch/index.php/s/Ax4NHYGLHbG8N1C", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 208, "comments": 11, "commits": 128, "created_at": "1652615854", "deletions": 21485, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "dqm-pending", "l1-pending", "hlt-pending", "core-pending", "alca-pending", "db-pending", "generators-pending", "geometry-pending", "operations-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-pending", "xpog-pending", "heterogeneous-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 37952, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 6, "state": "open", "title": " New Heterogeneous Memory Pool", "updated_at": "1653220600", "user": "VinInn"}

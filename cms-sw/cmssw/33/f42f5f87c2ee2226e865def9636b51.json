It can be merged safely without impacting existing setups.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe geometry, as well as the gen-sim step, has been tested and is working properly. \r\n\r\nThis is the first merge request concerning the CRACK topic. \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 198, "comments": 2, "commits": 93, "created_at": "1752059605", "deletions": 25228, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "dqm-pending", "l1-pending", "hlt-pending", "core-pending", "alca-pending", "daq-pending", "generators-pending", "geometry-pending", "operations-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-pending", "heterogeneous-pending", "tracking", "trk", "ml-pending", "changes-dataformats"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 48515, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "From cmssw 15 0 1", "updated_at": "1752059684", "user": "hayfasfar"}

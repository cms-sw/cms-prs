Now both are made accessible and more explicitly named\r\n- the MHT emulator was doing some incorrect decoding of the correlator jets, then incorrect encoding of the MHT for GT, that are both now fixed\r\n- MHT in the `L1TPFJetsTask ` was not consuming the correct collection for proper emulation of the L1T hardware, now fixed\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThese changes have been developed and studied in the context of the Phase 2 Global Trigger emulation and validation against the previously not-emulated Menu workflow by the L1T software team.\r\n\r\n@aloeliger ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1683820861", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1683575054", "deletions": 13, "labels": ["l1-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "upgrade-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "d30f52e99e7643b3474be571bd7be74a76978a40", "merged_at": "1683820861", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_13_2_X", "number": 41590, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "L1T Phase 2: correlator-to-GT interface for jets and MHT", "updated_at": "1683820861", "user": "thesps"}

This in turn entailed that if there was a movement exceeding the thresholds the DQM monitoring was crippled (all the other alignable parts were not plotted). I introduce a new boolean to decide whether to veto the upload, still not breaking the loop (so that all parts are plotted)\r\n   * a bug in `MillePedeDQMModule.cc` causing the thresholds on several parameters for `theta_Z` alignable to be taken instead from the `theta_Y`. \r\n\r\nThe situation before the fix:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5082376/41982380-95f65c82-7a2b-11e8-9879-da23e2502154.png)\r\n\r\nbecomes after the fixes:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5082376/41982202-190af49e-7a2b-11e8-819d-5a63416b34e3.png)\r\n\r\n***N.B.: no change in behavior for the actual payload creation is intended here, the changes shall affect only the monitoring***\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 7, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1530104451", "deletions": 9, "labels": ["alca-pending", "bug-fix", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-started"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 23697, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "open", "title": "[10.2.X] add a veto DB update boolean in the SiPixelAli harvesting to decide to block the payload creation", "updated_at": "1530110648", "user": "mmusich"}

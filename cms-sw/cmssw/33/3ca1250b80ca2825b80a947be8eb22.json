This PR also resets the default for dev to cms_conditions to be consistent with the DB uploads via the dropbox, and removes the obsolete boost shortcuts.\n\nThis PR replaces #11449 which did not merge.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1443437519", "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1443098406", "deletions": 17, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "e1181d344386220090609c848693a8f9a5aa4329", "merged_at": "1443437519", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 11459, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "adding schema to db shortcut name ", "updated_at": "1443437519", "user": "apfeiffer1"}

This is the main fix of this PR, which provides correct initialisation of physics for special physics lists\r\n\r\n2) DDWorld class should not communicate with Geant4 kernel\r\n\r\n3) DDProductionCuts - memory churn is reduced (each G4Region and G4ProductionCuts is instantiated and filled only once)\r\n\r\n4) EM physics constructors are cleaned up\r\n\r\n5) Improved info messages and substituted G4cout by LogVerbatim\r\n\r\nShould provide small reduction of memory churn and not change results of mainstream simulation. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nChecked SIM hits with private test\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\n\r\nBefore submitting your pull requests, make sure you followed this checklist:\r\n- verify that the PR is really intended for the chosen branch\r\n- verify that changes follow [CMS Naming, Coding, And Style Rules](http://cms-sw.github.io/cms_coding_rules.html)\r\n- verify that the PR passes the basic test procedure suggested in the [CMSSW PR instructions](https://cms-sw.github.io/PRWorkflow.html)\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 17, "closed_at": "1562957326", "comments": 22, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1562770527", "deletions": 229, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "efd325e55d574d81cd34d49249f8aeb1cbec517c", "merged_at": "1562957326", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27479, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 11, "state": "closed", "title": "Fixed and clean-up initialisation of Geant4", "updated_at": "1562957326", "user": "civanch"}

Because it was using the size of the hltResult to book the histograms.\nWe solved this by using the size of the hltConfig instead at booking time.\nThis was explicitly tested by comparing the resulting numbers from both methods.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 8, "closed_at": "1421782025", "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1421743501", "deletions": 1584, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "122909a850da93b260f2b82994001622a90a7899", "merged_at": "1421782025", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 7275, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Migrating TrigXMonitor to new DQM API", "updated_at": "1421783325", "user": "vanbesien"}

TBD)\n3) Iter5 and 6 are MVA only\n4) Muon iterations cuts are not identical (and requires further tuning)\n5) Duplicate rate a bit higher than before (it needs further tuning anyhow...)\n6) JetCore uses a simplified cut-based selection, waiting for its own specific MVA\n\nmanually ported from CMSSW_7_5_X #9538 (original by @VinInn).\nmanual rebase of #10233\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 60, "closed_at": "1438149613", "comments": 38, "commits": 56, "created_at": "1437832454", "deletions": 982, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-available", "fastsim-approved", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "f2f545e5a9db5e3f01293c3bf1843901a77f3234", "merged_at": "1438149613", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 10373, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "reimplementation of Track classifiers and Track Collection mergers", "updated_at": "1438335632", "user": "VinInn"}

It was previously \"disabled\" for Shashlik because the customisation didn't change to the correct hit collection.\nThis fixes the crash and changes the customisation so that the correct hit collection is used.\n\n@bsunanda, I had to change to create a copy of ShashlikTopology because the method deletes the object at the end ([line 171](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC/RecoEcal/EgammaClusterProducers/src/Multi5x5ClusterProducer.cc#L171)).  Previously the function would run correctly once, then crash the next time (or anything else that tried to use ShashlikTopology from the EventSetup).\n", "branch": "CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1409221684", "comments": 3, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1407943022", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "Next CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "number": 4941, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix Multi5x5ClusterProducer for Shashlik", "updated_at": "1422006079", "user": "mark-grimes"}

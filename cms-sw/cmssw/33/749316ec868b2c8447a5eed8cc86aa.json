Standard RECO sequences are not touched. The increase of the miniAOD event content is at the 1% level and has been discussed in the XPOG meeting of 06.09.2016 (*).  \n\nInternal tests and standard RECO test were run to make sure the backport acts as expected (**).\n\nCheers,\nRoger\n\n(*)\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/565391/\n\n(**)\nexceptions are runMatrix tests which failed due to CMS-DAS issues. \n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1473308466", "comments": 14, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1473246001", "deletions": 22, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "a0d040c1130fb182ef95f7553795ce341ea88b74", "merged_at": "1473308466", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 15758, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 4, "state": "closed", "title": "Extension of miniAOD event content to be able to run tau mva isolation discriminator on miniAOD input", "updated_at": "1473321632", "user": "roger-wolf"}

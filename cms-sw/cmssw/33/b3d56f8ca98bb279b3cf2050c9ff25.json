I created a customization point for FireworksWeb by moving nearly all functionality of `BareRootProductGetter` into a new `BareRootProductGetterBase`, except the logic to get the current file in `BareRootProductGetterBase::getIt()`. I added a new pure virtual function `currentFile()`, that is overridden and implemented in `BareRootProductGetter`. FireworksWeb can now provide a different implementation by inheriting from `BareRootProductGetterBase` and implementing only the `currentFile()`.\r\n\r\nResolves https://github.com/cms-sw/framework-team/issues/987\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles, unit tests pass.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 12, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1723814393", "deletions": 383, "labels": ["core-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 45718, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "open", "title": "Create BareRootProductGetterBase for FireworksWeb", "updated_at": "1724116708", "user": "makortel"}

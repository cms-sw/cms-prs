I created a customization point for FireworksWeb by moving nearly all functionality of `BareRootProductGetter` into a new `BareRootProductGetterBase`, except the logic to get the current file in `BareRootProductGetterBase::getIt()`. I added a new pure virtual function `currentFile()`, that is overridden and implemented in `BareRootProductGetter`. FireworksWeb can now provide a different implementation by inheriting from `BareRootProductGetterBase` and implementing only the `currentFile()`.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles, unit tests pass.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1723814393", "deletions": 383, "labels": ["core-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 45718, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Create BareRootProductGetterBase for FireworksWeb", "updated_at": "1723814418", "user": "makortel"}

In most of these cases the fix was to change the call from add to addDefault. With addDefault there is no cfi file generated so the problem is eliminated. In all these case, the generated cfi was not used anywhere in CMSSW and fixing them in another way would require expert knowledge of how the modules should be configured.\r\n\r\nThe fact that nothing used these generated cfi files also means that these problems were probably not causing any actual problems for users trying to run these modules.\r\n\r\nI also added an extra option to the edmWriteConfigs function that will create cfi files for a single plugin.\r\n\r\nThis should resolve issue #19690\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 13, "closed_at": "1500876171", "comments": 16, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1499952513", "deletions": 29, "labels": ["comparison-available", "core-approved", "daq-pending", "dqm-approved", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "a2d46b622d2a456cbbf53b764bc401cc6f377ce5", "merged_at": "1500876171", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_3_X", "number": 19729, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Check for duplicate cfi filenames while generating cfi files", "updated_at": "1511977890", "user": "wddgit"}

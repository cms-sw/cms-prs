In particular, I'm addressing [this comment](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/33148#discussion_r597789981) which was raised in the last RECO meeting. So, as requested by @VinInn, this PR changes the return type of `localCovariances`, `scLocalCovariances`, and `covariances` functions from `std::vector<float>` to `std::array<float,3>`. As only 3 floats are returned, array is a better and more memory-efficient choice. \r\n\r\nThis is a purely technical PR, and no change in physics is expected.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nrunTheMatrix.py successfully ran with 23234.0, 140.53, and 11634.0\r\n\r\nThis PR is not a backport.\r\nNo backport is needed.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 21, "closed_at": "1617146654", "comments": 17, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1616677433", "deletions": 119, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "code-checks-approved", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "hlt-approved", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "bf9409a66723379657b3924076573317c3b41dab", "merged_at": "1617146654", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 33270, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 6, "state": "closed", "title": "Technical optimisation of e/gamma (local)covariances function (11_3_X)", "updated_at": "1617146654", "user": "swagata87"}

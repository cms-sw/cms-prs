For each type of Run it is possible to customize the list of SD classes and the list of produced hit collections. It is not expected to have a visible CPU or memory reduction but this will allow to increase clarity of the configuration. If a new detector and an extra hit collection will appears it would be easy to add to the g4SimHits configuration file. No change in any WF is expected.

We have an ME4/2 and ME2/1 chamber with full trigger+DAQ at B904 for this purpose. This PR extends the L1T CSC DQM with option for ME234/2 and MEX/1 chambers at B904 (follow-up of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/33876). The results also hold for ME1/2 and ME1/3 because they share the same electronics setup (but do have different size and geometry).\r\n\r\nThanks to @barvic for helping with debugging, and to Karoly Banicz for taking the data.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested on the ME4/2 B904 chamber with a few thousand cosmic events.\r\n\r\n[CSC_dataVsEmul_B904_Cosmic_Run_210810_160642 (1).pdf](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/files/7087706/CSC_dataVsEmul_B904_Cosmic_Run_210810_160642.1.pdf)\r\n\r\nThere should be no changes in the tests because the algorithm did not change, just the analysis code.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nBefore submitting your pull requests, make sure you followed this checklist:\r\n- verify that the PR is really intended for the chosen branch\r\n- verify that changes follow [CMS Naming, Coding, And Style Rules](http://cms-sw.github.io/cms_coding_rules.html)\r\n- verify that the PR passes the basic test procedure suggested in the [CMSSW PR instructions](https://cms-sw.github.io/PRWorkflow.html)\r\n\r\nFYI @tahuang1991 ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 11, "comments": 21, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1630455574", "deletions": 54, "labels": ["l1-pending", "daq-approved", "dqm-approved", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "requires-external", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "number": 35100, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Extend L1T CSC DQM with option for ME234/2 chambers and ME2/1 chamber at B904", "updated_at": "1631108267", "user": "dildick"}

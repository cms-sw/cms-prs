These quantities are filled now with the IP values and two new taginfo variables are added for the significances themselves:\n\nsip2dsig, sip3dsig\n\nThis fix solves an error-prone naming ambiguity.\n\nThis PR fixes also a bug in the use of brackets in SoftPFElectronTagInfoProducer.cc, where the original:\n\nif(std::abs(properties.sip3d>MaxSip3D)) continue\n\nwas actually meant to be:\n\nif(std::abs(properties.sip3d)>MaxSip3D) continue\n\nThis fix produces small differences with respect to the original version of the code, though not significantly affecting the performance.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 15, "closed_at": "1442551571", "comments": 18, "commits": 10, "created_at": "1442252511", "deletions": 40, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "8bcbdcf48476d1ecf260df743a0776639610470f", "merged_at": "1442551571", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 11247, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix inconsistency in soft lepton taginfos naming", "updated_at": "1442870674", "user": "imarches"}

The old syntax is also supported. The decision on which format to apply is based on the presence or absence of key parameters for each implementation.\r\n\r\nThe discussion about the new format can be found here: #31910\r\n\r\nThe new code makes use of the ParameterSet validation system to enforce correctness.\r\n\r\nThe standard MessageLogger_cfi.py configuration has not been updated to use the new configuration at this point since it would cause too many non framework configurations to break. That migration will happen at a later stage.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nAll framework unit tests have been updated to use the new syntax and they all pass.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 63, "closed_at": "1605800926", "comments": 19, "commits": 12, "created_at": "1605294353", "deletions": 1473, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "44894200a64de16b728d02cc3cac068d4a365e84", "merged_at": "1605800926", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 32138, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 16, "state": "closed", "title": "Implement new MessageLogger configuration", "updated_at": "1605800927", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

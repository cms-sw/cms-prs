This PR suggests two improvements on top of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/42863.\r\n>\r\n> 1. Add the HLT-Scouting collections to the `MINIAOD` event content (not only to `MINIAODSIM`), [as per request of the Scouting group](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1345833/contributions/5665746/attachments/2750274/4786758/ScoutingMeeting_2023Nov10.pdf#page=5).\r\n>\r\n>     - Pro: for Primary Datasets (PDs, real data) whose RAW event content includes HLT-Scouting objects, the latter objects will also be included in MINIAOD. Right now, only one such PD exists, named `ScoutingPFMonitor`. It is used for offline studies related to Scouting, and the Scouting group currently uses a workflow with \"two-file solution\" to access offline objects from MINIAOD and HLT-Scouting objects from AOD. Having both in MINIAOD will simplify this workflow significantly. Note that this change (adding HLT-Scouting to MINIAOD) has no impact on any other PD, to my knowledge, as those PDs do not retain HLT-Scouting objects in RAW in the first place.\r\n>\r\n>     - Con 1: the size of the MINIAOD samples of the `ScoutingPFMonitor` PD will increase. This size increase has not been quantified. It is assumed to be at most 10% based on the checks done in #42863. Since this only applies to a single PD with relatively low rate ([below ~40 Hz during normal pp data-taking in 2023](https://cmsoms.cern.ch/cms/triggers/hlt_trigger_rates?cms_run=370293&cms_ls_from=388&cms_ls_to=388&props.19540_19396.selectedCells=ScoutingPFMonitor:2)), I dare say this cost is rather small. For example, if I check the total size of all the `Run2023` MINIAOD samples on DAS, I get 1.65 PB. If I restrict that to the `ScoutingPFMonitor` PDs, I get 2.8 TB (0.16% of the total).\r\n>       ```bash\r\n>       rm -f tmp.txt\r\n>       for ddd in $(dasgoclient -query \"dataset dataset=/*/*Run2023*/*MINIAOD* status=VALID\"); do\r\n>         dasgoclient -query \"file dataset=$ddd | sum(file.size)\" >> tmp.txt\r\n>       done\r\n>       cat tmp.txt | awk '{sum += $2} END {print sum}'\r\n>     \r\n>       rm -f tmp.txt\r\n>       for ddd in $(dasgoclient -query \"dataset dataset=/*Scouting*/*Run2023*/*MINIAOD* status=VALID\"); do\r\n>         dasgoclient -query \"file dataset=$ddd | sum(file.size)\" >> tmp.txt\r\n>       done\r\n>       cat tmp.txt | awk '{sum += $2} END {print sum}'\r\n>       ```\r\n>\r\n>     - Con 2: the size of MINIAOD samples derived from data tiers such as FEVTDEBUGHLT will also increase (again by a guess-stimated ~10% or less). I do not know this kind of use cases in detail. I see this happens, for example, in wfs such as `141.001` where there is a `reHLT` step on data with `--eventcontent FEVTDEBUGHLT` (followed by a 2nd step with RECO, MINI, NANO, etc). Here too, I would guess this use case is limited, and the overall cost of this increase could be considered small.\r\n>\r\n> 2. Integrate this better in the way HLT currently provides collections to the 'central' event contents in CMSSW. This PR defines a PSet `HLTriggerMINIAOD` in `HLTrigger/Configuration` (`HLTriggerMINIAOD` in this PR includes only the HLT Scouting event content), similarly to the way `HLTriggerAOD` and others are defined. This part of the PR is purely technical, it's just meant to homogenise how extra HLT-related collections are inserted in different data tiers.\r\n>\r\n>`HLTrigger_EventContent_cff.py` was not modified directly, but recreated by running an updated version of `HLTrigger/Configuration/test/getEventContent.py`.\r\n>\r\n>If approved, I would suggest to backport this PR to `CMSSW_13_3_X` to keep `HLTrigger/Configuration` as similar as possible in `13_3_X` (currently used for HLT-menu development) and later cycles (and to cover the unlikely scenario of taking data relevant to Scouting in 2024 with `13_3_X`).\r\n>\r\n>Attn: @elfontan @kelmorab (TSG/Scouting conveners)\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nNone beyond the checks done for #43327.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

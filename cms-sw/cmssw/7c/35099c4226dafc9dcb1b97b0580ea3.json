It only affects offline workflows (e.g. offline trigger studies).\r\n\r\nSince the `resetPSCountersEachLumiSec` switch already exists in earlier releases (and users can set it as needed in offline studies), there is no need to backport this PR.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported, please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nN/A", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 14, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1669376896", "deletions": 8, "labels": ["l1-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "number": 40158, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "change default of `resetPSCountersEachLumiSec` to `false` in L1T emulator", "updated_at": "1669834531", "user": "missirol"}

This is a purely framework-related update so no changes in the output are expected. In the process some limited cleanup of header file includes was done. As a by-product, the code in `RecoLocalTracker/SiPixelClusterizer/test/` was fully migrated to consumes (there were still a lot of `getByLabel` calls which were migrated to `getByToken`). Code touched in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/31697 intentionally skipped in this PR.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles and explicitly tested by running workflow 4.53.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nNo backport needed.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 81, "closed_at": "1606952360", "comments": 72, "commits": 47, "created_at": "1605045399", "deletions": 717, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "238a8b559bd13a72a74bdc852718fc8a6fad173e", "merged_at": "1606952360", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 32093, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 22, "state": "closed", "title": "Migration of pixel code to esConsumes", "updated_at": "1606952360", "user": "ferencek"}

It was explicitly checked that the new module is run during the MINIAOD step and leads to sensible results.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1599763728", "comments": 23, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1599033288", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved", "xpog-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "53c50cdd24c436cca4892e8fb7e0d5b5b59b641e", "merged_at": "1599763728", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 31328, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 9, "state": "closed", "title": "HF noise event filter", "updated_at": "1599763729", "user": "lathomas"}

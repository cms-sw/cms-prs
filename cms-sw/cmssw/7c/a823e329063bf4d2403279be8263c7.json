The python code in this job that causes the TTree to be made has now been factorized out into a separate file L1TrackNtupleMaker_cfi. Furthermore, an extra variable has been added to this TTTree, indicating if stub is in Tracker tilted barrel modules.\r\n2) Bug fix in displaced L1 tracking.\r\n3) Bug fix in eta calculation in Track.h\r\n5) Bug fix to StubKiller module used for partially dead tracker studies.\r\n6) Bug fixes & missing feature additions to improve agreement with L1 track firmware:\r\n  a) Bug fix to the MatchEngineUnit.\r\n  b) Bug fix in MatchProcessor algorithm related to track projections.\r\n  c) Add six bits to the TrackFitMemory output, which represent the phi regions of the two seed stubs. \r\n\r\nWe use git CI running on 1000 ttbar + 200PU events to check that the tracking performance is not significantly affected.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 16, "comments": 5, "commits": 22, "created_at": "1709831591", "deletions": 98, "labels": ["l1-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 44348, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Bug fixes & small improvements to L1 tracking of Phase 2 Outer Tracker", "updated_at": "1709884181", "user": "tomalin"}

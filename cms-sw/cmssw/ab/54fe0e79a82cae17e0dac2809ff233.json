For some reason it will not let any rechits pass. I working on a fix since this is necessary to keep the memory use down once we start collection rechits in the whole detector at once.\n\nThis is a decent patch for now since the subcomponents are clustered separately in this version of HGC RECO.\n\nLast commit should help reduce the retained memory by quite a bit.\n\n@pfs @vandreev11\n", "branch": "CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": "1418634743", "comments": 8, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1418389020", "deletions": 19, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "b334769c2368f0c04bbcb185c710d9a4bdb4a8f5", "merged_at": "1418634743", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "number": 6893, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Reduce HGC rechit memory footprint", "updated_at": "1418647556", "user": "lgray"}

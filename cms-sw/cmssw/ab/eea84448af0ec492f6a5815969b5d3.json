It includes the general workflow of PCL as well as dedicated improvements for LA measurements. The details are listed below:\r\n  - `SiPixelLorentzAnglePCLWorker` creates and fills the 2D histograms of electron drift and its production depth as tracks pass through the barrel pixel. We applied improved selections on clusters. Tree production of tracks and clusters is also included in case of other needs and is made optional. \r\n  - `SiPixelLorentzAnglePCLHarvester` fits the histograms and obtains LA. We have improved the fitting by moving to a higher order polynomial fit to include the nonlinear distributions in the histograms.\r\n  - Pass the DetID of layer 2 new modules in `SiPixelLorentzAnglePCLWorker` and `SiPixelLorentzAnglePCLHarvester` and measure LA fo each one of them.\r\n```\r\nNew module names:\r\n    BPix_BmI_SEC7_LYR2_LDR12F_MOD1\r\n    BPix_BmI_SEC8_LYR2_LDR14F_MOD1\r\n    BPix_BmO_SEC3_LYR2_LDR5F_MOD1\r\n    BPix_BmO_SEC3_LYR2_LDR5F_MOD2\r\n    BPix_BmO_SEC3_LYR2_LDR5F_MOD3\r\n    BPix_BpO_SEC1_LYR2_LDR1F_MOD1\r\n    BPix_BpO_SEC1_LYR2_LDR1F_MOD2\r\n    BPix_BpO_SEC1_LYR2_LDR1F_MOD3\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested with 50000 events from `/store/data/Run2018D/SingleMuon/ALCARECO/SiPixelCalSingleMuon-ForPixelALCARECO_UL2018-v1/230000/F33B7CA6-256A-B34F-9536-7594FBC6F75B.root` \r\nResults were presented in the [AlCaDB meeting](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1069948/) and also attached.\r\n[LA_AlCa.pdf](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/files/7255397/LA_AlCa.pdf)\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR: N/A\r\n\r\nBefore submitting your pull requests, make sure you followed this checklist:\r\n\r\n- [x] verify that the PR is really intended for the chosen branch\r\n- [x] verify that changes follow [CMS Naming, Coding, And Style Rules](http://cms-sw.github.io/cms_coding_rules.html)\r\n- [x] verify that the PR passes the basic test procedure suggested in the [CMSSW PR instructions](https://cms-sw.github.io/PRWorkflow.html)\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 19, "closed_at": "1634208092", "comments": 56, "commits": 12, "created_at": "1633108451", "deletions": 13, "labels": ["alca-approved", "operations-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "pdmv-approved", "orp-approved", "upgrade-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "2a970a26756d9b3f07e840b9f0d9895c52ed69e4", "merged_at": "1634208092", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "number": 35507, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 57, "state": "closed", "title": "Prompt calibration loop module for SiPixelLorentzAngle", "updated_at": "1634208093", "user": "wweiphy"}

A quick summary of the improvements in this regard:\r\n\r\n   * Fix the score definition that was wrong in both cases. In particular, changes to the overall normalization were needed.\r\n   * Fix the computation of the fraction of the shared energy between a `Trackster` and its linked `CaloParticles`\r\n   * Review the definitions of _merge_, _duplicate_ and _fake_ rate for the `Trackster` validation. Once this PR will be merged, the accompanying documentation at [this link](https://hgcal.web.cern.ch) will be updated.\r\n   * Add the possibility to run the validation on several `Tracksters` collections in a more or less transparent way. **More changes are foreseen for the future** (in separate PRs), namely:\r\n      * separate the _association code_ from the _validation code_, creating ad-hoc `EDProducers` for that purpose;\r\n      * improve the overall `python` definition of parameters and the accompanying `C++` code;\r\n      * improve the python plotting capabilities.\r\n   * The improved `Trackster` validation, when tested on closeby samples, allowed for better tuning of the cuts of the electromagnetic `TICL` iteration.\r\n\r\nWe expect differences in `Tracksters`' output for the electromagnetic iteration and, also, changes in few histograms (binning and naming)\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested with:\r\n   * `runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos`\r\n   * `runTheMatrix.py -w upgrade -l 20493.51,20493.52`\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 9, "closed_at": "1572462553", "comments": 28, "commits": 12, "created_at": "1571980853", "deletions": 275, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "d6a6021a2984814535dde28d05484371f9523180", "merged_at": "1572462553", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 28265, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Improve Score Definition and EM Trackster Reconstruction", "updated_at": "1572462553", "user": "rovere"}

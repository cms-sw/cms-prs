It was redundant because the range was the same as the one used to define the `InvMass` variable to begin with. See the current like 171 in `DiMuonMassBiasClient.cc`:\r\n    ```C++\r\n    RooRealVar InvMass(\"InvMass\", \"di-muon mass M(#mu^{+}#mu^{-}) [GeV]\", xmin, xmax);\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n  * Remove `RooFit::Save()` argument, which was not necessary because the return value of `fitTo` was not used anyway, and the `Save()` argument only affects that.\r\n\r\n  * Fix memory leak where a RooPlot object created by `frame()` was not deleted.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1666817442", "deletions": 10, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_6_X", "number": 39867, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "RooFit-related fixes in DiMuonMassBiasClient", "updated_at": "1666817923", "user": "guitargeek"}

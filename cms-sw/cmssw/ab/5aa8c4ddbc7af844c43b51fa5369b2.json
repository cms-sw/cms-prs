It was not immediately obvious because the parameter was specified as untracked with a default value provided.\n\nLet this be a lesson to all: untracked parameters are not a valid substitute for a proper fillDescriptions.*\n\nIn addition to fixing the capitalization problem, I added fillDescriptions for this analyzer and also cleaned up the FastSim Era usage in the python area. Hopefully the validation team can add fillDescriptions for the other analyzers at some point.\n\n*Unless for some reason the validation/DQM code needs to use untracked parameters, in which case I can revert that part of the change, but I doubt this is the case.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1471357655", "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1470771996", "deletions": 17, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "8f7c5249fc8dfdd8ead1ff026a91485f1c87f781", "merged_at": "1471357655", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 15403, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix HcalHitsV for FastSim", "updated_at": "1471357655", "user": "kpedro88"}

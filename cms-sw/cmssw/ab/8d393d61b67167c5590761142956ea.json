Therefore, the fix was tested with [RecoTauTag/RecoTau/test/runDeepTauIDsOnMiniAOD.py](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/RecoTauTag/RecoTau/test/runDeepTauIDsOnMiniAOD.py) test configuration. (Actaully, the bugs have been discovered when running this configuration). \r\n=> This test configuration is added to units tests in this PR.\r\n\r\nQ: It will be good to have this fix already in 11_1_X series - does it require a backport, i.e. if master is already switched to 11_2_X?\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1591107799", "comments": 25, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1590395716", "deletions": 292, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "orp-approved", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved", "xpog-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "e4a3c1ab95a1de02b35a22f0db0a6dfee8f73bf2", "merged_at": "1591107799", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 29976, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 9, "state": "closed", "title": "bug fix to runTauIdMVA.py tool", "updated_at": "1591107799", "user": "mbluj"}

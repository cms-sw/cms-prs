In ROOT5, the tests do not fail, because CINT, unlike cling, is not a real compiler, and is permissive of these errors.\nThis pull request fixes the macros so that each variable is defined only once.\nPlease merge this request as soon as convenient.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_ROOT6_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1418196691", "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1418189056", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "core-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "2c8f70a21e0fa909862c7d0118caf59a264474d4", "merged_at": "1418196691", "merged_by": "nclopezo", "number": 6853, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix duplicate definitions in ROOT macros", "updated_at": "1418331623", "user": "wmtan"}

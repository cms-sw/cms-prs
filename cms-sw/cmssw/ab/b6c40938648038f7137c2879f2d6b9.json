This new gun enables generation of displaced unstable particles which is not possible with already existing [FlatRandomPtAndDxyGunProducer](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/IOMC/ParticleGuns/src/FlatRandomPtAndDxyGunProducer.cc).\r\n\r\nTechnically, the PR migrates an algorithm present in the [FlatRandomPtAndDxyGunProducer](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/IOMC/ParticleGuns/src/FlatRandomPtAndDxyGunProducer.cc) to a new module based on a generic Py8 gun ([Py8GunBase](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/GeneratorInterface/Pythia8Interface/interface/Py8GunBase.h)).\r\n\r\nBackport of #33832\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nIt was validated with a custom workflow that the newly added module behaves as expected. Test configuration (GeneratorInterface/Pythia8Interface/test/Py8PtAndDxyGun_displacedTaus_cfg.py) is part of this PR.\r\nThe change does not affect any existing workflows by construction (a new \"generator source\" added).\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nBackport of #33832 for a MC production for Run-3 studies (trigger).", "branch": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1624509505", "comments": 6, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1624456354", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["fully-signed", "generators-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "59ab1a4f81a5c14302302f0d121a93428d11edb9", "merged_at": "1624509505", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 34226, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add a Pythia8 gun for displaced particles (flat in Pt and Dxy) [backport of #33832 to 11_2_X]", "updated_at": "1624509506", "user": "mbluj"}

This cut is more robust against pileup than the sensor occupancy cut used to flag a cluster as merged.  We set the cut to -6000 in the config, where 6000 is a reasonable choice to turn on this selection.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1418396766", "comments": 21, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1418069357", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-rejected"], "merge_commit_sha": "48fff2a7dadc0f811225eab128fb0ed621de96b8", "merged_at": "1418396766", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 6831, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Option to use old CPE error if charge exceeds one MIP", "updated_at": "1421428064", "user": "wmtford"}

After that, I produced a new module for producing pre- post- firing plots with a second way using eta/phi map for L1T objects (muon, jet, tau, egamma, MET) for every BX as well as for the first bunch, last bunch and isolated bunch.", "branch": "CMSSW_10_0_X", "changed_files": 8, "closed_at": "1518554831", "comments": 10, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1517406252", "deletions": 13, "labels": ["backport-ok", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "f0ab2151d094808987e9fc4e85bfd8e90ca2d469", "merged_at": "1518554831", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_0_X", "number": 22052, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Dedicated Timing Plots - New Settings for uGT and Eta/Phi Map - L1T & Online DQM - CMSSW - 100X", "updated_at": "1518554831", "user": "dtsitson"}

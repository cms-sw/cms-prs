For consistency, the units _eV, _MeV, _GeV, and _TeV are added to `CMSUnits.h`, along with enegy conversion functions. The definitions of the conversion functions were moved to `DataFormats/Math/interface/angle_units.h` to avoid code duplication. `angle_units.h` is not an ideal location for energy and length conversion functions, but such simple functions don't really justify the creation of a new header file to hold them.\r\n\r\nThis PR resolves issue #29750.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe new units were added to a test program, and it successfully compiled.\r\n\r\nNo backport is needed.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1645971992", "comments": 8, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1645562017", "deletions": 35, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "5235a5d6c56b1c91ada4546a5d5772a64ab9a88a", "merged_at": "1645971991", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 37037, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add energy units to CMSUnits.h", "updated_at": "1645971992", "user": "cvuosalo"}

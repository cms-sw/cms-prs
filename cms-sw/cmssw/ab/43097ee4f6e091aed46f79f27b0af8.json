They are noticeably different than the ones defined in 2007. An introduction to the new CLCT patterns can be found here [1]. Accordingly, we will have to change the data formats for both CLCT and LCT for Run-3. A proposal for the CLCT is being developed. A proposal for the LCT format can be found here [2], p13. \r\n\r\nThe plan to integrate the new patterns in the CSCCLCTProcessor is as follows:\r\n1) Define new patterns (this PR)\r\n2) Rewrite old patterns in new form\r\n3) Enable option to construct legacy CSCCLCTDigi with new patterns\r\n4) Construct new CSCCLCTRun3Digi with new patterns and based on comparator codes\r\n\r\nBeyond the above mentioned changes in the CSCCLCTProcessor, there will be changes to the LCT data format in simulation, the (O)TMBs (with and without GEM), the packer/unpacker, the DQM/validation,...\r\n\r\n[1]\r\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/778315/contributions/3238278/subcontributions/268636/attachments/1770627/2876988/181213-CCStatus_WNASH.pdf\r\n\r\n[2]\r\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/869092/contributions/3664061/subcontributions/294640/attachments/1956917/3252387/Tao_LCTformat_20191204.pdf\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCompiled the code\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n@tahuang1991 @ptcox ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1576569637", "comments": 12, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1575994856", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "a18be557596a4bff5f4056716ed63745af87e8e9", "merged_at": "1576569637", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 28600, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Define CLCT patterns for Run-3 (CCLUT-1)", "updated_at": "1584357941", "user": "dildick"}

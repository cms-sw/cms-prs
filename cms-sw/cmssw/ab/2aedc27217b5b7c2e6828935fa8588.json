The code was written by following that used for the CSC.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nA test of the alignment showed that the GEM geometry has left-handed local coordinate systems, which are incompatible with the standard Alignment records, which store the detector rotations as Euler angles from the global coordinate system. I removed the explicit axis flip which was responsible for this, and reran an upgrade sample and checked that the GEM rechits and segments were still being built properly.\r\n\r\nBy default, the alignment is off (an applyAlignment parameter is introduced in the GEM geometry builder), to avoid picking up currently non-existing alignment records. This PR is a first step to allow alignment to be applied to GEM, and while we plan to build on this by writing GEM alignment code, for now the alignment will not be used. Therefore, the PR is expected to produce no changes in output.\r\n\r\n@jshlee @kpedro88 ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 16, "comments": 5, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1554194946", "deletions": 15, "labels": ["alca-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "db-pending", "geometry-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-started", "upgrade-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 26320, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Add Alignment Records for GEM Geometry", "updated_at": "1554195406", "user": "watson-ij"}

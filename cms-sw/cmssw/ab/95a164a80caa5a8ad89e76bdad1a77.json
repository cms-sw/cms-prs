This PR simply replaces the use of boost::regex with std::regex four places in the framework where the replacement is trivial and obvious.\nThere are two other places in the framework where boost::regex is left in place because the code uses boost regex member functions that have no obvious equivalent in C++.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1435775765", "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1435772261", "deletions": 25, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "core-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 9996, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Use std::regex instead of boost::regex where feasible in framework", "updated_at": "1435776358", "user": "wmtan"}

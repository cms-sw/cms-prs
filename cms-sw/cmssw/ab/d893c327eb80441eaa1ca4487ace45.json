This is done in order to access per-channel `photoelectronsToAnalog` values for HPDs from the database, repurposing the `SiPMParameters` object. The hardcode conditions are updated appropriately. All other values for SiPM-related quantities will be set to dummy values, since they will not be used for HPDs.\r\n\r\nI tested the effect of this PR locally by changing the `photoelectronsToAnalog` value in `Hcal_Conditions_forGlobalTag_cff` and observing changes in digi, rechit, etc. distributions. No changes in central workflows are expected.\r\n\r\nUpdates to the database conditions for HCAL will follow separately. Removal of the `photoelectronsToAnalog` Python parameter in `hcalSimParameters_cfi` may also follow separately.\r\n\r\nattn: @abdoulline, @mariadalfonso ", "branch": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1486741080", "comments": 16, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1485791815", "deletions": 27, "labels": ["alca-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "b5bc9b2ee83fcd09cce6bf0cf02984c78fada0ae", "merged_at": "1486741080", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "number": 17326, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 5, "state": "closed", "title": "Add HcalHPD type", "updated_at": "1486741081", "user": "kpedro88"}

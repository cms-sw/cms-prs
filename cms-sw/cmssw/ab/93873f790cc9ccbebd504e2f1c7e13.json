This information is needed in the event to pick the appropriate numbers (hardcoded in BTLDetId for the time being to support eta and phi methods) for geometry computation in digitization and reconstruction.\r\n\r\nThis class adds this information in mtdStructureTopology.xml files, which could be used to store the whole topology information (as provided by tkLayout for tracker). The mechanism used to propagate the information though the MTDParametersFromDD class mimics what is done in the Hcal geometry though the HcalTopologyMode object (from which the code has been reused).\r\n\r\nA simple test class it provided that shows how the correct scenario is picked and can be retrieved through a MTDTopology accessor method. This test class can be further extended to validate other functionalities (beyond the scop of this PR).", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 21, "closed_at": "1543610165", "comments": 31, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1543326738", "deletions": 21, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "db-approved", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "f084ec018ce6e9998d89201674f4a9fe37465fea", "merged_at": "1543610165", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_4_X", "number": 25352, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 7, "state": "closed", "title": "MTD: store geometry scenario in topology record", "updated_at": "1543610165", "user": "fabiocos"}

In phase2 premixing stage2 (in `DataMixingModule`/`PreMixingModule`) these would lead to \"get products without calling consumes\" exception (I don't know why the regular mixing works), so this PR calls `getByLabel()` only for the enabled subdetectors.\r\n\r\nIn addition I use the occasion to reduce the duplicated code in the constructors by removing almost everything from one of them and calling the other one from it. This change also fixes a bug in APD simulation that was fixed in #17300 for classical mixing for premixing (I presume this effect won't be seen in PR tests quoting from #17300 \"the code that's not used in the standard sequences\" (needed only if one wants to simulate ECAL barrel \"spike\" noise)\".\r\n\r\nTested in CMSSW_10_1_X_2018-03-05-2300, no changes expected.\r\n\r\n@mdhildreth @kpedro88 ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1522415321", "comments": 20, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1520843986", "deletions": 228, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "49fe916cbcc074748adcffee7c23ee835666252a", "merged_at": "1522415320", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 22581, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix consumes for phase2 premixing and reduce code duplication in EcalDigiProducer", "updated_at": "1522415321", "user": "makortel"}

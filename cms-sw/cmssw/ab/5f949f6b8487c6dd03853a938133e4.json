Small refinements added (such as suppressing phase 0 pixel validation output in phase 1 pixel era) and the recent DQM client changes (as the code inherits from the phase 1 pixel DQM framework). Binning for the new Hits histograms has been optimised to be of the same order of magnitude as those plots it replaces.\r\n\r\nAdded validation modules for the phase 1 pixel code based off the phase 1 dqm framework. Replicates the functionality of the phase 0 code, namely:\r\n\r\nDigis\r\nHits\r\nRecHits\r\nTrack Clusters\r\nTracking MC Truth (referred to as TrackingParticle in the phase 1 validation directory structure)\r\nValidation/Configuration/python/globalValidation_cff.py; Validation/Configuration/python/postValidation_cff.py;\r\nand Validation/Configuration/python/trackerSimValid_cff.py; have been modified so that if the era is phase1Pixel, the new validation code is used.\r\n\r\nWhen in the phase 1 pixel era, the phase 0 pixel validation output is disabled. The phase0 validation has been kept in for cases where it may be needed in the future (such as a new rereco).\r\n\r\n@fioriNTU @lunik1 @ckmackay - you might be interested in this.\r\n\r\n\r\n@davidlange6 - Number of removed histogram bins from Phase 0 Validation for Pixel Tracker:\r\nTrackerDigis: ~19,080\r\nTrackerHits: ~1,440,000\r\nTrackerRecHits: ~16,170\r\nTotal removed: ~1,475,250\r\n\r\nNumber of added histogram bins for Phase 1 Validation for Pixel Tracker:\r\nSiPixelPhase1DigisV: ~841,600\r\nSiPixelPhase1HitsV: ~5,006,800\r\nSiPixelPhase1RecHitsV: ~981,640\r\nSiPixelPhase1TrackClustersV: ~273,520\r\nSiPixelPhase1TrackingParticleV: ~5,130\r\nTotal added: ~7,108,690\r\n\r\nTotal difference: +5,633,440 added \r\nN.B.

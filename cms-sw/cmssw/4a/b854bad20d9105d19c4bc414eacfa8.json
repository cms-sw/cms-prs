It is 8% in total (15% only for siStripApproximateCluster).\r\nI used LZMA4, run=388350 lumi=11\r\n```\r\nprocess.hltOutputPhysicsHIPhysicsRawPrime.compressionAlgorithm = \"LZMA\"\r\nprocess.hltOutputPhysicsHIPhysicsRawPrime.compressionLevel = 4\r\nprocess.hltOutputPhysicsHIPhysicsRawSecond.compressionAlgorithm = \"LZMA\"\r\nprocess.hltOutputPhysicsHIPhysicsRawSecond.compressionLevel = 4\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nThis PR is urgent, as we would like to have a backport to `CMSSW_15_1_X` for the upcoming HIon collisions. As discussed with TSG (@cms-sw/hlt-l2 ) and HIon (@icali @mandrenguyen) we would like to have a stream online using this new dataformat in the upcoming HIon run for testing (with the idea to use it in 2026 if the test is successful). \r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 7, "comments": 4, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1759070292", "deletions": 19, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "trk", "changes-dataformats"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_0_X", "number": 49013, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "New version of RawPrime (SiStripApproximateCluster)", "updated_at": "1759084563", "user": "silviodonato"}

Because of this, a missing dictionary error resulted when attempting put an SMatrix into an event.\nThis pull request adds stripping off the \"u\" or \"l\" qualifiers in class names containing integer template parameters, thereby correcting the error.\nThis fix required the use of std::regex_replace().  Since we need regex_replace() anyway, two other existing CMSSW functions currently used to normalize class names were removed, as their usage is here being replaced by calls to std::regex_replace().  The usage of these functions was local to the one modified source file.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1423315273", "comments": 13, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1423185272", "deletions": 34, "labels": ["comparison-available", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "7b3fe43b6c49250f168da2cae364e91b9b8532af", "merged_at": "1423315273", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 7586, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "ROOT does not use u or l qualifiers for integer template parameters in na...", "updated_at": "1423845473", "user": "wmtan"}

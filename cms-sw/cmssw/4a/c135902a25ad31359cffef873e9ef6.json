This would require a related update in `RecoPixelVertexing/PixelVertexFinding`.\r\n\r\nWhile doing this, I also encountered a missing dependency in the `test/BuildFile.xml` of one Geometry package.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n`scram` builds.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nN/A", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 3, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1643785238", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "geometry-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved", "heterogeneous-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 36859, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "removed unneeded `#include` in `ZVertexHeterogeneous.h`", "updated_at": "1643786383", "user": "missirol"}

While there is no physical equivalent of a `CSCBaseboard`, it will reduce a lot of code duplication. The TMBs and processors do not inherit from the base class yet. I will change that very soon.\r\n\r\n@tahuang1991 @lpernie ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 5, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1535471367", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["code-checks-pending", "comparison-pending", "l1-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_3_X", "number": 24403, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Return CSC name (e.g. ME+1/1/9)", "updated_at": "1535472915", "user": "dildick"}

While there is no physical equivalent of a `CSCBaseboard`, it will reduce a lot of code duplication. The TMBs and processors do not inherit from the base class yet. I will change that very soon.\r\n\r\n@tahuang1991 @lpernie ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1536063199", "comments": 32, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1535471367", "deletions": 39, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "d23b29e335016f6b82e3069a7976e05059b6d122", "merged_at": "1536063199", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_3_X", "number": 24403, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "New CSCBaseboard class and helper function in CSCDetId", "updated_at": "1536063199", "user": "dildick"}

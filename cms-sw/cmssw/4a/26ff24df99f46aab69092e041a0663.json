While there is no physical equivalent of a `CSCBaseboard`, it will reduce a lot of code duplication. The TMBs and processors do not inherit from the base class yet. I will change that very soon.\r\n\r\n@tahuang1991 @lpernie ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "comments": 6, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1535471367", "deletions": 39, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "l1-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_3_X", "number": 24403, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "New CSCBaseboard class and helper function in CSCDetId", "updated_at": "1535474631", "user": "dildick"}

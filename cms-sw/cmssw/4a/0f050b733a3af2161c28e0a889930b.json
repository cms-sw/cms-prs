While studying the performance of UParT b-tagging in heavy-ion simulations, it was found that sorting the input candidates by pT improved the performance in the most central (0-10%) PbPb collisions.\r\n\r\nThe flag to sort the candidates by pT is set to false by default, so no changes are expected in the standard configuration.\r\n\r\n@mandrenguyen @DickyChant\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested using ttbar PbPb simulations.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

This means when it tries to retrieve the PSet (in which the name is \"modname\"), it fails and doesnt recognise that it has saveTags=True. The code is now fixed to remove the front \"-\"  if it exists when trying to retrieve the module parameters.\n\nA second fix is for paths which has an ignored HLTLevel1GtSeed module. Currently it things there are two L1Seed modules and as such can not calculate the pre-scale. However there is really only one active one so before pushing back to the list of active L1GTSeeds, it checks if the module is ignore by looking for the \"-\" in front of the module name. \n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1455004144", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1454923681", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "hlt-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "63a117722d95009c95cf8eb735fb772cf0caea7f", "merged_at": "1455004144", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 13215, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "making HLTConfigProvider correctly handle ignored modules", "updated_at": "1455004144", "user": "Sam-Harper"}

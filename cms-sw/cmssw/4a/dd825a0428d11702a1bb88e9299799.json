It was about the fourth highest and the higher ones were recently fixed also. The intent is that this should not change results. I tested by printing the mva values calculated with and without this change in runTheMatrix test 10824.0 and they were identical. I also verified it removes the scaling with number of streams with igprof.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1524058526", "comments": 19, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1523643326", "deletions": 232, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "orp-approved", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "3e032f6f8d88a5a63769f68fe525b4f06d72b55f", "merged_at": "1524058526", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 22963, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Use GBRForest in PATMuonProducer", "updated_at": "1524058526", "user": "wddgit"}

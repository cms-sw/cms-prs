In the current code those are hard-coded which causes issues when the HLT RECO and miniAOD steps are run together in one workflow as discussed in #43861 issue.\r\n\r\nThe implementation is just a technical change and do not change behavior of the module as default values of newly added configuration arguments are equal to values which were hard-coded.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nVerified that newly added parameters do not change previously used values.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nForeseen backport to 14_0_X release series that will be used for 2024 operations.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1707400756", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 43917, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Configuration arguments for version and packing schema of covariance in DeepJetTag producer", "updated_at": "1707401247", "user": "mbluj"}

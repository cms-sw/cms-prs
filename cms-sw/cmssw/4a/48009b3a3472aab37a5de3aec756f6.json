Only exception is a DQMStore ->save() call if we run our code privately (switched off per default).\n\nThe only place where we still use DQMStore functionality is during the harvesting step, so hopefully all problematic issues have been solved.\n\nWe work with release CMSSW_7_1_0_pre2.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "changed_files": 20, "closed_at": "1397063366", "comments": 28, "commits": 10, "created_at": "1395918315", "deletions": 1845, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-rejected", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_7_1_0_pre6", "number": 3049, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Develop dqm 710pre2 v03", "updated_at": "1400143408", "user": "webermat"}

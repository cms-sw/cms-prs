Since the  decay is not implemented in Pythia, an external generator must be used.\r\nThis PR introduces a custom plugin that forces a particle (used here for the ) to decay using kinematic information read from an external ROOT file. The decay is generated in the particles center-of-mass frame by an external event generator (in this case, Pluto).\r\n\r\nPR validation:\r\n\r\nI successfully compiled the code in CMSSW_16_1_X_2026-02-15-2300 without any issues and privately produced a small MC sample for validation.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1771261775", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "new-package-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_1_X", "number": 50156, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Add custom plugin to force particle decays using products defined in an external file", "updated_at": "1771261795", "user": "Ma128-bit"}

The topic was discussed in the recent JMAR meeting [[slides]](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1438225/contributions/6053213/attachments/2915795/5117048/24.08.26_JMAR_Status%20of%20GloParT%20for%20AK8%20jets%20(v2024.08).pdf)\r\n\r\nGlobal Particle Transformer (GloParT) 3 is an inclusive tagging model for AK8 jets that covers the entire phase space and enables resonance mass regression for each jet class. It functions as both a global tagger and a mass regression model for AK8 jets and can also be utilized as a pre-trained model. The hidden layer neurons (with dimension 256) are stored in MiniAOD, providing the capability to resume all output scores. Further details can be found in the slides.\r\n\r\nIn summary, the AK8 jet features added to MiniAOD and NanoAOD are illustrated below.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"600\" alt=\"glopart-integration\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d09e7c7e-ccce-4d6a-87f4-1a81a02c6e36\">\r\n\r\nPlease test this PR with https://github.com/cms-data/RecoBTag-Combined/pull/61.\r\n\r\nNote: the current model in https://github.com/cms-data/RecoBTag-Combined/pull/61 is a placeholder for incorporating this PR. During our development history, GloParT 2 has already been validated to function properly within CMSSW (using this branch: https://github.com/colizz/cmssw/tree/dev-130X-glopart ), although it has not been officially integrated. We are now upgrading GloParT from version 2 to version 3 (details in slides), and the final GloParT 3 model will be ready within 2-3 weeks. We are suggested to make this infrastructure PR to cmssw first.\r\n\r\nAdding @qliphy @cmantill @rkansal47 @jmduarte \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe PR passes the unit test `test_globalpart_cfg.py`. It is also validated under the workflow AODSIM->MINIAOD->NANOAOD.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 8, "comments": 15, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1724876994", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "requires-external", "code-checks-approved", "xpog-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_2_X", "number": 45830, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Add GloParT inference utility", "updated_at": "1726509525", "user": "colizz"}

If the user tries to add it explicitly with the `--era` option then there is a warning that it is for internal use, but it is added anyway.\n\nIf a user wants to enable it in their own config file, not created with cmsDriver, then they have to create the `process` object with:\n\n```\nfrom Configuration.StandardSequences.Eras import eras\nprocess = cms.Process('HLT',eras.fastSim)\n```\n\n@lveldere, I'll email you privately with examples of how to use in configuration files.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1440660171", "comments": 6, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1440161728", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["comparison-available", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "f3e3e2f045708460c421abc8ca01b68df8f59d2a", "merged_at": "1440660171", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 10906, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add a \"fastSim\" era to configure FastSim modules", "updated_at": "1440661121", "user": "mark-grimes"}

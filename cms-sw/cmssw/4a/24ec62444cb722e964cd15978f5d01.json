Unfortunately, as detailed in #40260, the way it accomplishes this for external packages that use `std::cout` or `std::cerr` is not thread safe.  This PR adds a call to `Tauolapp::Log::IgnoreRedirection(true)` to disable the thread-unsafe buffer manipulations of the standard output streams.\r\n\r\nThis is a purely technical fix that may at the most lead to some mangled output due to concurrent writes to the (thread safe) unmodified `std::cout`.\r\n\r\nResolves #40260.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCompiles, trivial technical fix.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1670915380", "comments": 10, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1670520805", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["generators-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "4472f952f9da4311b4ff74b8ea9c7f9da2af857b", "merged_at": "1670915380", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "number": 40263, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Turn off Tauolapp output redirection", "updated_at": "1670915381", "user": "dan131riley"}

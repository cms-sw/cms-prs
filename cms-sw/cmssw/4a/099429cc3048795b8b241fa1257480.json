The code for filling these was accidentally deleted one year ago. It used to be at https://github.com/cms-L1TK/cmssw/blob/543b739bbe112a0e545cb45212c8365f249420ab/L1Trigger/TrackFindingTracklet/plugins/L1FPGATrackProducer.cc#L494 . This code was complex & relied on hard-wired geometry constants, so it's cleaner to remove it.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes isTilted(), getting the info from TrackerTopology in the L1FPGATrackProducer.cc . The PR also fixes operator==(), now checking if two stubs are in the same module by using the detId (filled in L1FPGATrackProducer.cc) instead of checking that their module & ladder are identical.\r\n\r\nThe KF does use isTilted() so is affected by this. But the tracking efficiency only changes by 0.1%, so it's not significant.\r\n\r\nN.B. @aryd SLHCEvent::SLHCEvent(istream) hard-wires the detId & tiltedBarrel variables at https://github.com/cms-L1TK/cmssw/blob/ianL1TStub/L1Trigger/TrackFindingTracklet/src/SLHCEvent.cc#L98 . These hard-wired values are incorrect, so the input .txt file used to stand-alone operation should be fixed so they can be read from there.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 249, "closed_at": "1653049420", "comments": 0, "commits": 57, "created_at": "1653049322", "deletions": 2266, "labels": ["simulation-pending", "l1-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "new-package-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 38027, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Ian l1 t stub", "updated_at": "1653049420", "user": "tomalin"}

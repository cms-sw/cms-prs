The TauSpinner weights allow to weight H->tau,tau events accordingly to different CP hypotheses.\r\n\r\nThe producer initializes the TauSpinner tool and then produces relevant weight tables only for events with the single-H->tau,tau decays, while for other event types tables are not produced. Therefore, size increase happens only for single-H->tau,tau samples and it is, with proposed setup with 5 different CP hypotheses and 2 weights per hypothesis, ~1.5% (measured with 1k VBF H->tau,tau events).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nValidated with standard NanoAOD configuration with H->tau,tau and no H->tau,tau samples.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nBackport to 14_1 series is foreseen.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 11, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1724853516", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "xpog-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_2_X", "number": 45828, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 9, "state": "open", "title": "TauSpinner weight table producer for HTT", "updated_at": "1725861929", "user": "mbluj"}

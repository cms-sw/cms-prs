Tau and electron type specific versions of the anti-e tauID producer (`TauDiscriminationAgainstElectronMVA6`) and an algorithm executed by the producer (`AntiElectronIDMVA6`) are merged each into one template version;\r\n2. Code rationalization and cleaning preformed;\r\n3. Explicit cfi configuration files replaced by auto-generated ones.\r\n\r\nModifications introduced in this PR are purely technical and therefore are expected that they **do not change** output of the modified anti-electron tauID.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nMatrix tests (`runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos`) successful.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 11, "closed_at": "1595223184", "comments": 29, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1594138361", "deletions": 1688, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved", "xpog-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "b2091ea9ee3ad18ee50cac937d6b1a93a1608122", "merged_at": "1595223184", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 30581, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 4, "state": "closed", "title": "Refactoring of anti-electron tauID", "updated_at": "1595223184", "user": "mbluj"}

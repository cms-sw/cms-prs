It still includes all isolated charged PFCandidates, so can be used for vetoes on isolated charged candidates in other analyses.\r\n\r\nThe collection now draws from the packedPFCandidates, lostTracks, and generalTracks collections. Any track satisfying both the following requirements is saved:\r\n- pT > 5 GeV\r\n- pT > 20 GeV OR (trackIso < 5GeV || relTrackIso < 0.2 || relMiniTrackIso < 0.2)\r\n\r\nThe IsolatedTrack class stores basic kinematic and isolation information, as well as details on the hit pattern in the tracker, dE/dx energy loss in pixels/strips, predicted intersections of the track with calorimeter cells (and the status codes of those calorimeters), and hadronic/EM energy components of nearby calo jets.\r\n\r\nTesting on various samples, the size of this collection is as follows:\r\n```\r\nSample       #/event   bytes/event (% total)\r\n--------------------------------------------\r\nDY           3.7       330 (1.0%)\r\nRelValTTbar  7.5       590 (1.1%)\r\nJetHT        6.1       510 (1.8%)\r\n```\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 8, "closed_at": "1497532349", "comments": 61, "commits": 25, "created_at": "1496172059", "deletions": 82, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "5205a468f7532c7989f9d06c0525e178c9f9cfc4", "merged_at": "1497532349", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_2_X", "number": 19025, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 14, "state": "closed", "title": "Update of isolatedTracks collection in miniAOD to include stopped track information", "updated_at": "1497629224", "user": "bjmarsh"}

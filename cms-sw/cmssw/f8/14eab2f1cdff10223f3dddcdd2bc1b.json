We have determined that this is due to a problem with the scheduler in the Triton ensemble model backend. This pull request contains code changes needed to convert from the ensemble model setup to a pure pytorch combined model. A companion cms-data PR will contain the necessary changes to the model config. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nLocal testing of workflow `10805.31_SingleGammaPt35+2018_photonDRN` has shown perfectly deterministic behavior.

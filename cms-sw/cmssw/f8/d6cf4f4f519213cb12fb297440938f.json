This will be the largest one time PR for this campaign. These files were all committed together as all the files which were doing forward referencing only need to be changed in this PR and not later ones which are related to different data products. I.e. this set of added Fwd.h files only require editing the other files once.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles. Cross checked that no further forward references exist for these classes in CMSSW.\r\n\r\nresolves https://github.com/cms-sw/framework-team/issues/1926", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 301, "comments": 17, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1771337362", "deletions": 408, "labels": ["alca-approved", "analysis-approved", "dqm-approved", "fastsim-approved", "geometry-approved", "hlt-approved", "l1-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "visualization-approved", "simulation-approved", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "pdmv-approved", "tests-started", "db-approved", "code-checks-approved", "xpog-pending", "tracking", "trk"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_1_X", "number": 50161, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Use Fwd.h files for classes which are stored [part 1]", "updated_at": "1771401954", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

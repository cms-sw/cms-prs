The test checks for the `CMSBOT_CI_TESTS` env var, or a `--force` argument, to override the variable.\r\n\r\nAlso fix the timestamp of the renamed file to include the hour, which was missing before, it will help with debugging.\r\n\r\nA `--help` argument to print the script's usage is also added.\r\n\r\nSee also: #46682\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested on LXPLUS. DQMGUI dev is currently unavailable for full testing.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nNot a backport.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 12, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1731490692", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_2_X", "number": 46690, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[DQM] Modify DQMGUI upload test to only run in automated environments", "updated_at": "1731523518", "user": "nothingface0"}

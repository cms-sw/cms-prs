A few additional variables have been included for electrons. \r\nThe paths of the models have been updated as well as the thresholds defining the default working point. \r\nAn additional threshold on the non-isolated background class has been included for electrons in PFEgammaFilters. \r\n\r\nThis PR comes along two PRs for ElectronIdentification (https://github.com/cms-data/RecoEgamma-ElectronIdentification/pull/24) and PhotonIdentification (https://github.com/cms-data/RecoEgamma-PhotonIdentification/pull/10) data repositories.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nFor documentation about the changes in the model training and input variables please refer to the slides at: https://indico.cern.ch/event/1096395/#12-egm-updates-for-run-3-prepa. \r\n\r\nThe correctness of the DNN configuration has been verified.  A validation of the physics performance of the PFID WPs is ongoing in the PF and Egamma group. \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 10, "comments": 2, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1637787129", "deletions": 64, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_2_X", "number": 36243, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "PFID with DNNs - updated model trained on Run3Summer21", "updated_at": "1637787649", "user": "valsdav"}

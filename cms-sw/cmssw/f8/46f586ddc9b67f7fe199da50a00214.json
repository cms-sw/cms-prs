I apply a tighter cut outside the barrel (95% vs 84%) to control the fake rate for pT3s. To select which set of cuts to use, I define two structs with member functions that allow me to toggle between the pT3 and pT5 cut values with a compile-time flag.\r\n- The module type of the last \"anchor\" hit of the T3 is now added as an input feature to the DNN to improve the fake rate in an eta region outside the barrel where the DNN struggled.\r\n- (For the standalone code) I merged the pT3 and pT3DNN flags used to save variables to the output ntuple to simplify what flags needed to be turned on when generating the training data for the pT3 DNN.\r\n\r\nMore info: [Replace_pT3_R-Phi_with_DNN.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22909998/Replace_pT3_R-Phi_with_DNN.pdf)\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles and runs on CPU and GPU with expected performance improvements.\r\n\r\nc.c. @slava77", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 10, "comments": 10, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1760456465", "deletions": 776, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "heterogeneous-pending", "tracking"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_0_X", "number": 49163, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Line Segment Tracking (LST): Replace pT3 Rphi Chi-Squared Cut with DNN", "updated_at": "1760534276", "user": "GNiendorf"}

For instance if old versions of nano (with old eras) were produced with this PR integrated they would have format which is not backward compatible with the same versions without this PR. We think, however, that there is not realistic use-case, i.e. old versions of nano are not produced with new releases. Keeping backward compatibility is possible, but implementation will be painful. Comments from experts are welcome.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nSuccessfully tested with the \"limited\" set of matrix tests and a custom nanoAOD production.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 7, "comments": 23, "commits": 20, "created_at": "1657717179", "deletions": 128, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "xpog-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 38726, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "open", "title": "DeepTau v2p5 in nanoAOD", "updated_at": "1659013018", "user": "mbluj"}

The increase in timing that results from the added \n  protection is not very significant (~3%).\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1397458979", "comments": 5, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1397100563", "deletions": 11, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "275ab40ce18a76372e344c3a270560c7ba132e07", "merged_at": "1397458979", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_1_0_pre7", "number": 3272, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Added Pythia8 status code for intermediate resonances to the GenJets particle selector", "updated_at": "1403359233", "user": "ferencek"}

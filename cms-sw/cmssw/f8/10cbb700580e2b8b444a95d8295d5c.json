The valuemaps produced at this step have been extended to provide some additional information in a more convenient form.  (Time at MTD, momentum magnitude of refitted track, etc)\r\n\r\n2) First pass of 4D vertex reconstruction runs on the output as above.  After a bugfix/protection it is able to deal with the resulting outliers from slower kaons/protons in a reasonable way.\r\n\r\n3) Addition TOFPIDProducer which tests compatibility of kaon and proton mass hypotheses for the tracks with the 4D vertices from 2) and produces updated timestamps where appropriate.  This producer also creates value maps of particle ID probabilities which can be used downstream.\r\n\r\n4) Second pass of 4D vertex reconstruction based on the refined timestamps from 3)\r\n\r\nThis pull request also migrates the PFCandidate timestamps to the fullsim/reconstruction ones (previously populated from the fastsim).  This automatically propagates to the packed candidates in MINIAOD as well.\r\n\r\nIn order to allow the propagation of the primary vertex times to the miniaod as well, the configuration for the timing eras has been reorganized such that the default \"offlinePrimaryVertices\" collection contains the 4D vertices (and an additional offlinePrimaryVertices3D collection is stored in the event.)\r\n\r\nIn order to facilitate comparisons and benchmarking, the fastsim-based timestamps and 4d vertex reco is still run and stored.  This is especially relevant since direct comparisons may validate the continued use of existing/fastsim-based results where fullsim-based ones are not yet available.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT NOTE:  The correct technical and physics operation of this pull request depends on the proper calibration of the MTD RecHits/clusters (coming in a separate PR shortly), since currently there is a 210ps offset for the BTL.  For private tests this offset has been corrected by hacking a hardcoded offset into the TrackExtender, but that is not included in this PR.\r\n\r\n@pmeridian  @lgray ", "branch": "CMSSW_10_4_X", "changed_files": 8, "comments": 1, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1547223715", "deletions": 51, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_4_X", "number": 25627, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Migrate 4D vertexing and downstream reco to full simulation/reconstruction track timestamps and add TOF PID (10_4_X)", "updated_at": "1547223745", "user": "bendavid"}

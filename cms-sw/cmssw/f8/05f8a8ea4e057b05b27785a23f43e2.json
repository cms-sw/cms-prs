This new model has been presented several times in the MTD DPG meetings. You can find a summary at [1]. \r\n\r\nThis PR introduces potential changes in the digi efficiency (since thresholds have been slightly changed), and in the time of arrival of the charged particles (since the time resolution model has been updated). \r\n\r\nThe Digi structure (ETLSample) has been also updated to accomodate for one additional parameter: the time over threshold. The ETLUncalibratedRecHit has also been modified maintaining backwards compatibility. If the time over threshold is zero, meaning that it's not present in the DIGI, then the old local reconstruction is run. On the contrary, if the time over threshold is not zero, a new local reconstruction is run, including the time-walk calibration.\r\n\r\n[1] https://indico.cern.ch/event/1254512/contributions/5270127/attachments/2595708/4480662/DPG-MTD-Feb17.pdf\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n1.- A full ttbar workshop has been run up to the DQM stage and the output of the MTD DQM has been inspected.\r\n2.- The same has been done starting from old digis to make sure the code is backwards compatible.\r\n3.- The tests suggested in PRWorkflow.html have been run. \r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 13, "closed_at": "1707487161", "comments": 36, "commits": 12, "created_at": "1705875371", "deletions": 72, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "upgrade-approved", "code-checks-approved", "mtd"], "merge_commit_sha": "149e5129eb40b7388638c7c9325a36121ed2df48", "merged_at": "1707487161", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 43762, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "A new digitization model for the ETL detector", "updated_at": "1707487162", "user": "parbol"}

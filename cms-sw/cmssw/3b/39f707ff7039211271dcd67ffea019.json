Key features include:\r\n\r\n  * Dedicated procModifier: The new `procModifier` (`heterogeneousCLUE`) configures the menu specifically for its timing variant, not the default one.\r\n   * **Dependency**: Requires [this external](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmsdist/pull/9231) to compile correctly.\r\n\r\nCurrently, no workflow utilizes this feature publicly. Private tests on the HLT Phase2 timing server show an increase in throughput, consistent with CE-E clustering in HGCAL being less than 5% of overall HLT Phase2 timing.\r\n\r\n**Bug Fix Included**: This PR addresses a bug affecting the position of layer clusters. Rarely, the log-weighted algorithm returns all negative (i.e., 0) weights, defaulting to (0,0) in the transverse plane. This caused issues at later stages when eta and phi of the clusters were needed. The new default in these rare cases is to use the seed position.\r\n\r\n**NOTE**: This PR, via the included `procModifier`, only configures the timing variant of the menu, not the default one!\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 43, "comments": 48, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1717854293", "deletions": 59, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "hlt-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "upgrade-pending", "requires-external", "code-checks-approved", "heterogeneous-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 45178, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 77, "state": "open", "title": "Heterogeneous Workflow (CLUE) in Phase2 HLT Simplified Menu", "updated_at": "1719259837", "user": "rovere"}

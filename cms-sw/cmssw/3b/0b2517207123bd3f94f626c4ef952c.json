The framework cannot handle underscores in friendly class names, since underscore is a field separator in branch names.\nThis request fixes this problem, so the affected relvals will get further along.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_ROOT6_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1391193543", "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1391192865", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["core-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "07a256f8ab616116c6796ede82a0e3217d09c3f5", "merged_at": "1391193543", "merged_by": "ktf", "number": 2260, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Handle root6 class naming", "updated_at": "1391194039", "user": "wmtan"}

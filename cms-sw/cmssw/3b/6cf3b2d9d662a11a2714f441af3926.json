Using the function to extend the tracker bounds we get displaced vertices with outside of the default tracker bounds.\r\n\r\n@jniedzie @kakwok @enibigir \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1740556076", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "tracking"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 47454, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Function to set tracker bounds in KalmanVertexFitter", "updated_at": "1740579513", "user": "kerstinlovisa"}

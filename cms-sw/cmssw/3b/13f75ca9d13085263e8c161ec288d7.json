The fix is for the Python getByLabel to check if the wrapper has been nulled and reset it if necessary.  Unit test is included.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1422897109", "comments": 10, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1422888731", "deletions": 14, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "507b4777470ebe1907d87abbd6f539ec7801409a", "merged_at": "1422897109", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 7502, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix pyroot FWLite getByLabel to reset Wrapper when branch not found", "updated_at": "1470675558", "user": "dan131riley"}

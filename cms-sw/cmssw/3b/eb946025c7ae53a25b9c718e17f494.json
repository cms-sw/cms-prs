It is not a direct port as some of the assumptions made for the CSC do not apply to ME0. It is now set as the default. Also updated standard segment algorithm to use the chamber as the coordinate reference frame. \r\n\r\nRight now the default cfg parameters are for a 10 eta partition geometry and 768 strips...this will change once the geometry is finalized.\nAutomatically ported from CMSSW_9_0_X #17677 (original by @nickmccoll).\nPlease wait for a new IB (12 to 24H) before requesting to test this PR.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 13, "closed_at": "1489862061", "comments": 42, "commits": 17, "created_at": "1488453900", "deletions": 190, "labels": ["comparison-available", "orp-approved", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "7e44ea5b89093b25a8eaa686ba0ec4485df837b6", "merged_at": "1489862061", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_1_X", "number": 17687, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 23, "state": "closed", "title": "CSC RU segment algorithm tuned for ME0", "updated_at": "1489862064", "user": "cmsbuild"}

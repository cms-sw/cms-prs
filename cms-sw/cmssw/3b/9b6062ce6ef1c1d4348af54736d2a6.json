That will be replaced at some point before the actual datataking\n\nSubmitting only for 80X as this is intended only for 2016.\nVK\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 86, "closed_at": "1455601728", "comments": 90, "commits": 12, "created_at": "1449086064", "deletions": 620, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "6a704eed08bad08266ca0a89d5b3b7b07346d391", "merged_at": "1455601728", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 12651, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "HCAL DQM Update", "updated_at": "1455601728", "user": "vkhristenko"}

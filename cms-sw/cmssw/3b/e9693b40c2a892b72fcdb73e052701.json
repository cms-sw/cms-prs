(Most of these changes are ported from 62XSLHC.)\n\nA new parameter for calotowermaker is propagated to all the relevant HLT configs.\n\nA few notes:\n1. I already rebased this onto #11423, to avoid a future (small) merge conflict.\n2. The matrix tests will crash. This is expected because the new CaloTower geometry record is not in the database yet.\n3. I validated this PR using 4.53 with the XML geometry, comparing clean CMSSW_7_6_X_2015-09-23-2300 to the same IB with this PR (using checkdeps). The output is identical, as expected; see plots below:\n\n![eta](http://kjplanet.com/dqm/eta.png)\n![phi](http://kjplanet.com/dqm/phi.png)\n![pt](http://kjplanet.com/dqm/pt.png)\n\nattn: @bsunanda, @ianna \n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 60, "closed_at": "1445334751", "comments": 227, "commits": 18, "created_at": "1443198794", "deletions": 744, "labels": ["alca-approved", "comparison-available", "db-pending", "geometry-approved", "hlt-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "ab1783855522de77c91d126775dfed15c4bba636", "merged_at": "1445334751", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 11497, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 31, "state": "closed", "title": "merge SLHC updates for CaloTowers", "updated_at": "1445334751", "user": "kpedro88"}

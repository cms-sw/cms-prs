The behavior should have been to return an empty range.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the behavior such that the ProductIDs of the cluster collections are always added to the `ClusterTPAssociation`.\r\n\r\nThanks to @slava77 for reporting.\r\n\r\nThere should be no changes in standard workflows (as the exception has not been observed before).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n@slava77 said that the problematic event got processed correctly.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 10, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1554093867", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 26304, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Fix a corner case in ClusterTPAssociationProducer", "updated_at": "1554117210", "user": "makortel"}

For phase2, the following folders in `Tracking` should disappear\n- `TrackSeeding`\n- `TrackBuilding`\n- From `TrackAllTPEffic`, everything else except `general_...` and `cutsRecoHp_...`\n- From `TrackFromPV`, everything else except `general_...`, `cutsRecoHp_...`, and `simulation`\n- From `TrackFromPVAllTP`, everything else except `general_...` and `cutsRecoHp_...`\n\nand the following appear\n- `TrackGsf`\n- In `TrackConversion`, `ckfInOutFromConversions_...` and `ckfOutInFromConversions_...`\n- In `Track`, `cutsRecoAK4PFJets`\n\nAs a consequence,  `globalEfficiencies` and `..._coll` histograms under the folders above have changes too, and many `..._Mean` and `..._Sigma` histograms produced by `DQMGenericClient` may show tiny numerical differences.\n\n@rovere @VinInn @ebrondol @kpedro88 \n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1471842129", "comments": 19, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1471000770", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "a9203ce7517af3e88f4564971bd3d5997b558df4", "merged_at": "1471842129", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 15448, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Use standard tracking validation for phase2", "updated_at": "1471842129", "user": "makortel"}

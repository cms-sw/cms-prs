This code is based on byte wise memory copies\r\nfrom a 2 byte array to a non-trivial class. It probably\r\nworks, probably will always work, and it is fast,\r\nbut there is undefined behavior and big vs little endian\r\nissues lurking in this hack and strictly speaking the\r\nstandard does not guarantee this will work.\r\n\r\nI moved the memcpy into a member function within the\r\nclass so that the hack is encapsulated with the data\r\nit is hacking (an improvement). And empirically\r\n(with GCC 810 on cmslpc40.fnal.gov) I find this causes\r\nthe compiler warning to no longer occur.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 11, "closed_at": "1533749842", "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1533578660", "deletions": 15, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "b5a87a224c711fe89a555ae80f9f2c3cdc201cd0", "merged_at": "1533749842", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_3_X", "number": 24220, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix GCC 8 compiler warnings, CSCRawToDigi", "updated_at": "1533749842", "user": "wddgit"}

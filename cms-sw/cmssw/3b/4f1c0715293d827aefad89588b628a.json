Gabrielle Hugo will look into it.\n- Due to overlaps Totem and BRM were removed from the scenario. It needs to be checked if other forward sub-detectors should be (re-)included. To be checked, then update the rest of 2023 scenarios.\n- Very forward region beyond 16377 mm is not described - waiting for more details from engineers. Weights of pump station, support and bellow to be verified.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1470662213", "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1470662065", "deletions": 285, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "geometry-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 15392, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Post LS2 Beam pipe", "updated_at": "1470662213", "user": "ianna"}

O2O code for HI does not set a default, so previous results were garbage. Boundaries of 4 and 17 correspond to all non-HF regions.\n\nThis algorithm is not actually used by any HIN physics group, but this fix should save someone in the future who might want to to ETT with HI Stage 1 triggers.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1453727193", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1453681109", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "970351d0e6d80b71cc00fdb450a7be027f553ddc", "merged_at": "1453727193", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 13048, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix Stage-1 L1 HI ETT algorithm", "updated_at": "1453727194", "user": "richard-cms"}

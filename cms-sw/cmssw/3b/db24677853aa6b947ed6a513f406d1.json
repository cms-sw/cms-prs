This reduces the number of CondCore unit tests that fail from 20 to 11.\n2) Two unit tests that are fixed by this change have an assert removed.  This assert previously aborted the tests to avoid an infinite loop that otherwise occurred.\n3) One unit test (testORAIO) has an assert added to fail the test immediately.  The new ROOT interface fixed the previous failure of this test, but this test now hoards memory to toe point of exhaustion. So, we fail deliberately to avoid this for now.\nPlease merge this request in the same IB as ROOT6 is updated to the HEAD of the v6-02-00-patches branch, as they are mutually dependent.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_3_ROOT6_X", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1417081812", "comments": 2, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1417041725", "deletions": 39, "labels": ["alca-pending", "comparison-pending", "db-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "2973e8962a558efebb09153c2cdd33ebf556ee09", "merged_at": "1417081812", "merged_by": "davidlt", "number": 6648, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Concurrent with root6 interface change", "updated_at": "1417122933", "user": "wmtan"}

The seeding layer set is deduced from the seed hits. In order to have necessary information to create the histograms with fixed binning, a list of all seeding layer sets is given as a configuration parameter. In the configuration side, the seeding layer sets of all seed producers (of a given sub-era) are merged by a new function.\n\nTested in 8_1_0_pre2, expecting only new histograms without changes in existing ones.\n\n@rovere @VinInn \n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 12, "closed_at": "1462355551", "comments": 10, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1461664728", "deletions": 19, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "1fb75aabc4bb03a92c3c71e79952aa3b75fff107", "merged_at": "1462355551", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 14248, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add plots vs. seeding layer set to MultiTrackValidator", "updated_at": "1462355552", "user": "makortel"}

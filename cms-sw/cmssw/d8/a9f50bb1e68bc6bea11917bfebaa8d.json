Track Pt-clamping is introduced in vertex sorting.\r\n>      This is supposed to mitigate the effect of spurious tracks with large pt due to miss-measurement, resolution or inaccurate calibration/alignment.\r\n>\r\n>The effect has been tested in Z->tau-tau events that are supposed to be among those who most suffer from signal-vertex miss-identification.\r\n>The effect is small if not negligible. see: http://innocent.home.cern.ch/innocent/RelVal/ztt_clamp/plots_selectedPixelVertices/pvtagging.pdf\r\n>where we compare clamping at 20, 75 (the default) and 1000 GeV.\r\n>This is not unexpected given the resolution of HP quadruplets, those used to build vertices, that reaches ~30% at ~70 GeV.\r\n>It may be different with initial calibrations or large inefficiency.\r\n>\r\n>Results for ttbar can be found in\r\n>http://innocent.home.cern.ch/innocent/RelVal/gpuMTVclamp/plots_selectedPixelVertices/pvtagging.pdf\r\n>\r\n>  2. The number of tracks is stored in the track SOA.\r\n>      This should make the use of the SOA more user-friendly.\r\n>\r\n>Default has changed, so expect small regressions.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRelies on the validation done for the original PR.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\n#37281", "branch": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "changed_files": 10, "comments": 5, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1648889693", "deletions": 40, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "backport-ok", "heterogeneous-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 37444, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Backport to `12_3_X` of \"Patatrack: introduce pt-clamping in vertex sorting, add #tracks in track SOA\"", "updated_at": "1648901119", "user": "missirol"}

This PR is a simple temporary  fix to clear the maps at the proper time.\nThis fix was requested by David Lange.\nSince my tests of this PR are still in progress, it would be prudent to test this PR before merging.\nNOTE: The consumes interface for TrackerHitAssociator will later be re-implemented in a more robust and less error-prone way very soon.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 8, "closed_at": "1431020492", "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1431007929", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "6a3a50837616225c8fb85de101b7520af3ae07cd", "merged_at": "1431020492", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 8990, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Temporary fix to clear TrackerHitAssociator maps each event", "updated_at": "1431031306", "user": "wmtan"}

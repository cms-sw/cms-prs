It will consume SuperClusters (new with TICLv5) only in TICLv5\r\n\r\nNew parameters have been included also at HLT \r\n\r\nThe performance against TICLv4 can be found in the DPS approval talk https://indico.cern.ch/event/1462666/contributions/6158255/attachments/2940573/5170734/TICLv5_DPS_version3.pdf\r\n\r\n\r\nShould be tested with a .203 workflow\r\n\r\nE.g.\r\n```\r\ntest parameters:\r\n\r\n    - workflow_opts= -w upgrade\r\n    - workflow = 29896.203\r\n    - enable = profiling, hlt_p2_timing\r\n```", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 10, "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1730198600", "deletions": 227, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "hlt-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_2_X", "number": 46539, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "TICLv5.1 : Improve skeleton linking and parameters tuning", "updated_at": "1730199164", "user": "waredjeb"}

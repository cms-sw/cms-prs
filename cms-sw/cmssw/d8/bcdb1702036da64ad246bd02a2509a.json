Padding bytes (0xff) can be appended after the end of each event or INIT message. Intention is to add them at the end of the file (4096-byte blocks) to round the file size so it is compatible with O_DIRECT copy from DAQ RUBUs to Lustre system in hope this will reduce deadtime issues seen recently.\r\n\r\nStreamer Input sources will automatically detect padding which will (typically) be appended to streams transferred to Tier-0. Also an option was added to generate files which contain padding after each event or INI object.\r\n\r\nUpdate: DQM and EcalCalibration unit tests were extended with the padded format test as well.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nUnit tests added to generate and read padded streamer file. Patch tested with 13_1_X (PR #41125) with production streamer files without padding and padded files produced in a test system.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. =\r\nBackport of #41125 for 13_0_X\r\nAdding support for padded files for this release cycle so format can be used Online for the HLT output merging and parsed by Tier-0 and other streamer clients.", "branch": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "changed_files": 20, "closed_at": "1679977509", "comments": 12, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1679755546", "deletions": 66, "labels": ["alca-approved", "core-approved", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "backport-ok"], "merge_commit_sha": "22623e1308c5d58efbf8c48e4f00d1f3cabe327b", "merged_at": "1679977509", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "number": 41186, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "(13_0_X) streamer format padding backport", "updated_at": "1679977509", "user": "smorovic"}

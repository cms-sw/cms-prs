The motivation is that since pixel hits are more precise than strip hits, it could be useful to give them more weight (e.g. 2) when associating tracks to TrackingParticles. The default behaviour is preserved (i.e. pixel hits are weighted by 1).\n\nTested extensively in 7_6_0_pre6, and now again in 8_1_0_pre9, no changes expected in monitored quantities.\n\nFor those interested, I have here an old MTV showing the effect of using weight 2 for pixel hits\nhttps://mkortela.web.cern.ch/mkortela/tracking/validation/CMSSW_7_6_0_pre6_trackTPassoc/\n\n@rovere @VinInn \n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1470717389", "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1470384743", "deletions": 69, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "762efd14b5da07a8cb56cdf5b176c71bd78a30f8", "merged_at": "1470717389", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 15371, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add possibility to weigh pixel hits in QuickTrackAssociatorByHits", "updated_at": "1470717390", "user": "makortel"}

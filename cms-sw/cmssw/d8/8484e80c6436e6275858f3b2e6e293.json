The inclusive vertex finder selections are also tightened to save time. \r\n2) Iterative tracking:  Raise pT min and region builder thresholds for some steps.  Change region builder to be centered on early PV. \r\n3) Cluster cuts:  Tune max pixel and strip cluster selections, which make tracking bail on crazy events.   These cuts were check on pileup events of two central (b=0) XeXe events in MC.  An extra margin was left for data/MC differences. \r\n4)  Run island photon superclusters\r\n5)  Run HI-style photon isolation\r\n6)  Keep calotowers in AOD\r\n\r\nWith these inclusions, the pp reco runs in under 30 sec in our tests, compared to about 60 sec before this customization. \r\nFor reference, HI reco runs in about 10 sec.\r\n\r\nTo test on a b=0, i.e., a super-central event, run:\r\ncmsDriver.py step3 --conditions auto:phase1_2017_realistic -n 10 --era Run2_2017 --eventcontent RECOSIM --runUnscheduled -s RAW2DIGI,L1Reco,RECO --datatier GEN-SIM-RECO --filein /store/user/mnguyen/hydjetDrum5_XeXe_b0_920/hydjetDrum5_XeXe_b0_920/crab_Hydjet_Quenched_XeXe_B0_5442GeV_HIDIGI_920/170928_065932/0000/step2_DIGI_L1_DIGI2RAW_HLT_PU_1.root --customise RecoHI/Configuration/customise_PPwithHI.customisePPwithHI\r\n\r\nXeXe will only be in 92X, so I haven't made a PR into the master (but I could of course). \r\n\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_9_2_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1507231969", "comments": 10, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1506940428", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_9_2_X", "number": 20714, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Customization to run pp reco on XeXe events", "updated_at": "1507231969", "user": "mandrenguyen"}

Due to the way C++ Preprocessor is\nimplemented for C++ (GCC) we cannot use diagnostic pragmas to silence\nthem. This might be resolved in future (e.g., GCC 6.1.0) [1]. Until then\nthis would make sure that unused variables from CLHEP are not triggering\nfatal errors.\n\nNote, this also could be resolved by modifying CLHEP and using 'used'\nattribute on special variables. This would force compiler to **emit**\nthem, thus resolving the errors.\n\n[1] https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2015-07/msg02414.html\n\nSigned-off-by: David Abdurachmanov David.Abdurachmanov@cern.ch\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1443688597", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1443427590", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "27240f59d71c0dc36584ea75d52df75c4b959fbe", "merged_at": "1443688597", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 11519, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Remove -Werror=unused-variable to downgrade errors from CLHEP", "updated_at": "1443688597", "user": "davidlt"}

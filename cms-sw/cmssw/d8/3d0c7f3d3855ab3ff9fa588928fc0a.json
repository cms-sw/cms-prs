This is very relevant for the performance of the Pixel detector in Run3 studies.\r\nThe fix has been provided by M. Swartz and JHU group (@pmaksim1 @cmantill @OzAmram )\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nEnclosed are the plots illustrating the issue and the performance after the fix is applied. \r\nResults are shown for templates and generic reconstruction with and without the Irradiation Bias Correction and with the bug [left hand side] and with the bug fixed [right hand side]. As you can see, without the bug fix the resolution in the central region is significantly degraded,\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5082376/60272564-b8b7b480-98f4-11e9-941e-4c3d5c31ae49.png)\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\n\r\nbackport of #27380\r\nto be used for the `Run3Summer19DR` production studies. \r\n\r\ncc:\r\n@tvami @tsusa @leaca\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1562045211", "comments": 15, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1561637783", "deletions": 10, "labels": ["bug-fix", "comparison-available", "db-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "88fe980e4fce12f9eaf72f89fe6c2cfb51db29e1", "merged_at": "1562045211", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 27381, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "[10.6.X] Fix SiPixelGenError Interpolation for Irradiation Bias Correction", "updated_at": "1562045211", "user": "mmusich"}

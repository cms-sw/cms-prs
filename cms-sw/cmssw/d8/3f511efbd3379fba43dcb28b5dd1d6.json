Due to the dependency on \"BTauGenericMVAJetTagComputerRcd\" and \"JetTagComputerRecord\", the corresponding b-tagging computers need to be masked in run3. Only DNN taggers will be the only supported ones in run3. To accommodate the change, this PR changes the discriminator sources with Era Modifier.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nPR tested locally with runTheMatrix with Run3 era and 125X_mcRun3_2022_realistic_Queue condition.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

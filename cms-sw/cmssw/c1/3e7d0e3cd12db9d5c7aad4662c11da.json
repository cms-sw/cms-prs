For the future we expect them to be already computed and saved in MiniAOD, so we use the extractions instead, in a similar way as `patCaloMet`.\r\n\r\nThe PR was initially made towards cms-nanoAOD. Then Andreas suggests making one here since cms-nanoAOD is out of sync. \r\n\r\n@steggema @intrepid42 \r\n\r\n@ahinzmann @lathomas \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\ntest on a small sample and it works as expected. Also passed unit tests and the runTheMatrix tests.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1596544374", "comments": 54, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1592484553", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved", "xpog-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "a0b0c7d3d926ad706f4bbc2cde77961db95e52b8", "merged_at": "1596544374", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 30291, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "Add DeepMET into NanoAOD", "updated_at": "1596785022", "user": "yongbinfeng"}

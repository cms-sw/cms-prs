So this fix has the 2D template ES producer always look for the default templates (instead of 0T templates) and modifies the Cluster Repair CPE to turn off the 2D reco if the mag field is not 3.8T.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe expect this PR to produce no changes except for 0T data. \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1559150854", "comments": 36, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1558722387", "deletions": 17, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "d44e8413c40731e219d7608079ec488bccc76b19", "merged_at": "1559150854", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 26940, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 14, "state": "closed", "title": "Turn off Cluster Repair for 0T data", "updated_at": "1559150855", "user": "OzAmram"}

L1TZDCProducer puts ZDC based EtSum into the event, which can be picked up in trigger emulation and cut on as with any other EtSum object. New EtSum IDs are added for ZDCP and ZDCM (plus and minus). Additional PR will be made by @elfontan interfacing this PR w/ the Global trigger.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nEmulator output validated against offline ZDC Et Sum calculations ( @hjbossi ) :\r\n[ZDCEmulationValidation.pdf](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/files/12413042/ZDCEmulationValidation.pdf)\r\n\r\nThe following suite of tests were done after successful build\r\n```\r\nscram b runtests\r\nscram build code-checks\r\nscram build code-format\r\n```\r\nNote two tests failed - see output of attached file: \r\n[scramBRunTests_Attempt2.txt](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/files/12413098/scramBRunTests_Attempt2.txt)\r\n\r\nNote that on inspecting full test log, this is because file could not be accessed (do not believe this is an issue w/ voms or certificate, Attempt2 in file name is after rerunning voms). If an appropriate file can be provided, happy to recheck these tests. The full test log is attached here: \r\n[testing.log](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/files/12413111/testing.log)\r\n\r\nOther than scram b run tests, other commands completed seemingly correctly - output can be provided if necessary\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nWe intend to backport to CMSSW_13_2_X as that is the release designated for heavy ions datataking\r\n\r\nTagging a few additional users to watch this PR: @ginnocen @icali ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 20, "comments": 6, "commits": 32, "created_at": "1692732086", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["l1-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "new-package-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_3_X", "number": 42634, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 11, "state": "open", "title": "L1t zdc emulator cmssw13 3 x", "updated_at": "1692855977", "user": "cfmcginn"}

These changes have no effect on DQM other than a significant reduction in these warnings.\r\n\r\n#### PR description:\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with a description of the feature proposed or problem addressed, what changes are expected in the output if any, what other PRs or externals it depends upon if any -->\r\nDue to diverse reasons, offline DQM logs are currently filled up with false alarms from ECAL DQM. Some plots that are only meant to be filled online (HLT emulation) produce a warning when an offline DQM process tries to fill them. Also, the collections passed to ECAL DQM are slightly different in different running conditions (offline, HI, pp collisions), and this is expected because of the slightly different rechit algos run with each process. Plots that are not meaningful for cosmics runs also produce similar warnings.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes most problems with unnecessary warnings in the logs due to ECAL DQM. This is done by introducing a new flag that is set differently in the offline cfg file or by reusing already existing flags, and also by including the correct collection names in the cfg files.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with a description of which tests have been performed to verify the correctness of the PR, including the eventual addition of new code for testing like unit tests, test configurations, additions or updates to the runTheMatrix test workflows -->\r\n\r\nWe ran the standard suite of tests: `runTheMatrix.py --nproc=4 --nThreads=10 -l limited -i all --ibeos`, and noted that all warnings related to ECAL DQM disappear from the logs.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\nNot a backport.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 8, "closed_at": "1581323077", "comments": 25, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1576885837", "deletions": 7, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "f7d8f42edcec07379c2f5bc5706490a1ab480efb", "merged_at": "1581323077", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 28672, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "ECAL Logs Cleanup", "updated_at": "1581410542", "user": "tanmaymudholkar"}

A logical protection against unwated values of gain identifier is incorrect in the ```TrivialAmplitudeAlgo``` class. As far as I can see the fix is simply replacing ```||``` with ```&&```, i.e. the gain id must be between 1 and 3 included. This class is very old, and practically unused in production workflows as far as I can see (the ECAL selective readout mechanism is used). \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles, wf 11634.0 runs without apparent effect.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1588316168", "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1588231138", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "001575a02c999693d183fbb76aeb8fb18331eee4", "merged_at": "1588316168", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 29597, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "ECAL Digitization: fix logical bug in protection against unwanted gainId values in trivial zero suppression", "updated_at": "1588316168", "user": "fabiocos"}

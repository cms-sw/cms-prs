It is proposed for more performant ZDC simulation. Baseline simulation is expected to be unchanged.\r\n\r\n1) Extra option to simulate faster ZDC and HGCal is added. If enabled the Russian roulette method may be applied in these calorimeters. For ZDC it is enabled by default, for HGCal - disabled.\r\n\r\n2) When ZDC simulation is enabled, CPU time for MinBias events increased in ~5.5 times, for ttbar - in ~1.5 times. In this PR some optimization is introduced, which is not significant: ~9% for MinBias and ~3% for ttbar. In the default simulation (ZDC is not enabled), no change is expected. Having not a big improvement, this PR is useful, because remove from simulation relatively rare tracks going out of ZDC, further tracking of these tracks has no sense. \r\n\r\n3) Also unused headers in few classes are removed. An option is added to remove e+-, gamma from simulation, which may be useful for GPU R&D.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nprivate\r\n\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

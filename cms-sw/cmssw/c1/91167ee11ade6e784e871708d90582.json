Replacing the `ESProducer` with an `EDProducer` has smaller impact on the configuration side than alternatives, and allows some reduction of repeated construction of `TransientTrackingRecHits` from same clusters. In addition to what was presented in the RECO meeting on  Jan 16th (https://indico.cern.ch/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=293827), this PR contains further optimization based on comments by Chris and Liz.\n\nAll configuration files found with `git grep SeedingLayersESProducer` were migrated, except the ones that looked like dumps from ConfDB (under `HLTrigger` and `DQM/DataScouting`). Because of the configuration changes, all workflows containing HLT will be broken until the changes are migrated to ConfDB and to the dumps.\n\nRebased on top of 7_0_0_pre12 + #2269 (=first two commits).\n\nMultiTrackValidator with 40 events of 13 TeV TTBar + 40 PU (25 ns) gives identical results. With 100 TTbar+40 PU events, overall RECO timing decreases by ~0.5 % and heap size increases by ~10 MB. With 15000 events from run 207515 and menu /online/collisions/2012/8e33/v2.3/HLT/V28 (including prescales), overall HLT timing decreases by ~0.8 % and heap size decreases slightly (~100 kB).\n\nFYI: @Martin-Grunewald, @VinInn\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "changed_files": 243, "closed_at": "1392039403", "comments": 29, "commits": 48, "created_at": "1391498022", "deletions": 1806, "labels": ["alca-pending", "fastsim-pending", "geometry-pending", "hlt-pending", "new-package-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "tests-rejected"], "milestone": "CMSSW_7_1_0_pre5", "number": 2286, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 6, "state": "closed", "title": "Replace SeedingLayersESProducer with an EDProducer", "updated_at": "1402613412", "user": "makortel"}

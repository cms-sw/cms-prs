It is meant to be used with Powheg samples containing taus so that no Powheg events are lost.\r\nSince DecayHandler is meant to decay one particle at a time, while the standard Pythia tau decayer decays the correlated pair, part of the decay history is saved and then used to fill the products of the second (correlated) tau.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nValidation plots for W and Z, things look as expected: https://mseidel.web.cern.ch/mseidel/cms/PDG_TAUS/\r\n\r\nIn particular, here is the number of tau->charged lepton decays in Z events:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1311783/81648578-37dfa980-942f-11ea-87d3-7255cd1eeee7.png)\r\nAs expected, 0 lepton is depleted completely, and the ratio betwen 1 and 2 leptons stays the same.\r\n\r\nTo check spin correlations, here is a plot of the dPhi between the two charged leptons, in case of both taus decaying to charged leptons:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1311783/81648708-6a89a200-942f-11ea-9ae7-1e2d2228ea32.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nBackport of #29567, needed for 2016 MC production\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1589884570", "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1589265956", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "generators-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "23af15682cbbfaab8d00d8a5412a9200b8b923e0", "merged_at": "1589884570", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "number": 29806, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Backport of #29567 (biased tau decayer) to CMSSW_7_1_X", "updated_at": "1589884571", "user": "intrepid42"}

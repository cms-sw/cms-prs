This would be possibly intended to be used for the ReReco of Run2017H (and possibly also G) plus corresponding low PU 13 TeV (and possibly 5 TeV) Monte Carlo.\r\n\r\nThis era therefore is identical to the Run 2 default in CMSSW 10x in this respect, and therefore there is no need for any change in master, and the dedicated era is only required for 94x.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT:  This should not be merged yet, pending the discussion in the PPD meeting Feb. 15, since it's not decided yet whether or not to do this (and if so only for Run2017H or also for Run2017G)", "branch": "CMSSW_9_4_X", "changed_files": 7, "comments": 1, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1518619974", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_9_4_X", "number": 22222, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Add Run2_2017_lowPU era for Run2017H", "updated_at": "1518619997", "user": "bendavid"}

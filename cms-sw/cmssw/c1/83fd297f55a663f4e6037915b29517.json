It's needed for muon identification studies and commissioning of the HB new readout. There should be no impact on CPU time, since the information is already extracted. We just need to make sure it won't cause significant increase in the output. If it does we will use it only in special requests. Quick check on Run2018 data shows ~1% increase of MiniAOD, which should be Ok.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1552165317", "comments": 51, "commits": 10, "created_at": "1551202078", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "cd9c78bb1302a4877ca5acc27da9a74ef20d887d", "merged_at": "1552165317", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 26021, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 14, "state": "closed", "title": "Store HCAL RecHits for volumes crossed by muon trajectory", "updated_at": "1552165317", "user": "drkovalskyi"}

It's needed for muon identification studies and commissioning of the HB new readout. For now the plan is to enable it only in Cosmics. There should be no impact on CPU time, since the information is already extracted. We just need to make sure it won't cause significant increase in the output. If it does we will use it only in special requests.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "comments": 1, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1551202078", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["code-checks-pending", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 26021, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Hcal rechits", "updated_at": "1551202102", "user": "drkovalskyi"}

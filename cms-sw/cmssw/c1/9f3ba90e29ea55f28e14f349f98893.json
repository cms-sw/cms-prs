These methods were not found to be in use anywhere in CMSSW, except now for adding GTT objects to L1Nano. This fix updates the methods, and they appropriately return all the magnitude + float bits, which enables full agreement in L1Nano for Vertices and TrackJets. scram build updateclassversion does not produce an updated class version/hash (nor direct usage of edmCheckClassVersion -g ...).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis PR passes\r\nscram b\r\nscram b code-checks\r\nscram b code-format\r\nscram b updateclassversion\r\nUsed to generate GTT objects in L1Nano format for ~3000 events\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

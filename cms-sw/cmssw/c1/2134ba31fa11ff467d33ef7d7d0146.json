A simple job using a prototype alloc monitor showed reduced amount of memory held from event to event.\r\n\r\nNOTE: this should just be a refactoring so the PR tests should show no differences. If there are differences than debugging will be necessary.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "comments": 8, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1732455675", "deletions": 114, "labels": ["db-pending", "reconstruction-approved", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "xpog-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_0_X", "number": 46789, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Reduced allocations in  ShiftedJetProducerT", "updated_at": "1732543840", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

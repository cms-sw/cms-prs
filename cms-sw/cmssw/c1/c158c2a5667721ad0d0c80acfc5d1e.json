We are adding the client and adapting BuildFile.xml to include unit testing for the new client as well.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis PR has been prepared starting from `CMSSW_15_1_X_2025-06-23-2300 `:\r\n```\r\ncmsrel CMSSW_15_1_X_2025-06-23-2300 \r\ncd CMSSW_15_1_X_2025-06-23-2300/src\r\ncmsenv\r\ngit cms-init\r\ngit cms-addpkg DQM/Integration DQM/HLTEvF\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning `git cms-checkdeps -a -A` shows that there are no further dependencies. For validation, I ran:\r\n```\r\nscram b\r\nscram b code-checks\r\nscram b code-format\r\nscram b\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat is left to do is to validate the online DQM client by running it on a `DQMOnlineScouting` file from the new stream !\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is not backport but it will be backported to 15.0.X for 2025 data taking operations.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 8, "comments": 20, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1750785672", "deletions": 9, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "hlt-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "requires-external", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 48398, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 6, "state": "open", "title": "New HLT Scouting DQM Online Client", "updated_at": "1751023446", "user": "jprendi"}

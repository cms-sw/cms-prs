The associated recalibration is also introduced, using the same method as HE. The implementation includes a \"scenario\" parameter like the one recently introduced for HEDarkening, to allow for easy addition of HB scintillator replacement scenarios in the future. HB darkening currently is _not_ turned on by default, but must be activated by manually adding set_HB_aging_scenario to the config file. (This may be changed in the near future).\n\nThis commit also fixes a small bug introduced in #3207 which assigned the wrong depth segmentation to towers 16 and 17 when calculating the HE recalibration. The effect of this bug on aging simulations would have been negligible.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "changed_files": 18, "closed_at": "1415029315", "comments": 2, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1414528429", "deletions": 14, "labels": ["alca-pending", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "e7e75bebed77d557b662239a05203ffb549dfd9a", "merged_at": "1415029315", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "number": 6059, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "HB radiation damage model", "updated_at": "1415029315", "user": "kpedro88"}

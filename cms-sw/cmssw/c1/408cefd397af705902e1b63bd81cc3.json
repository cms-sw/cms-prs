The algorithm gets\r\nactivated for the phase 2 tracker geometry (T27) containing bricked pixels in TEPX&TFPX, as well as the central 1 (3) rod(s) of \r\nTBPX L2 (L3 and 4). The detailed description of the geometry and corresponding changes got included in the [PR#34120](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/34120) . This update do not have any impact on the Outer Tracker digis (verified with Phase2 DQM plots). Attaching a few slides for the IT distributions. \r\n[BrickedPR.pdf](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/files/7117435/BrickedPR.pdf)\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nValidation done using SingleMuFlatPt2To100 events (runTheMatrix workflow 39104.0). No change observed in Digi DQM distributions for OT, as expected.\r\n\r\nVerified that the PR passes the basic test procedure suggested in the CMSSW PR instructions\r\n\r\n@emiglior @franzglessgen", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 8, "closed_at": "1631255138", "comments": 24, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1630945491", "deletions": 34, "labels": ["simulation-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "upgrade-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "cb27650b0cc9c4bfe9ad56ff1094d7976927d1da", "merged_at": "1631255138", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "number": 35173, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 10, "state": "closed", "title": "Tracker Phase2 Digitizer framework update for BrickedPixel ", "updated_at": "1631255139", "user": "suchandradutta"}

Specifically:\r\n\r\n- [HLT_PFHT200PT30_QuadPFPuppiJet_70_40_30_30_TriplePFPuppiBTagDeepCSV_2p4](https://cmshltupgrade.docs.cern.ch/Phase2Menu/Paths/HLT_PFHT200PT30_QuadPFPuppiJet_70_40_30_30_TriplePFPuppiBTagDeepCSV_2p4/) \r\n- [HLT_PFHT330PT30_QuadPFPuppiJet_75_60_45_40_TriplePFPuppiBTagDeepCSV_2p4](https://cmshltupgrade.docs.cern.ch/Phase2Menu/Paths/HLT_PFHT330PT30_QuadPFPuppiJet_75_60_45_40_TriplePFPuppiBTagDeepCSV_2p4/)\r\n\r\nThese are same as `DeepFlavour`. These DeepCSV paths have already been removed from the timing variant of the simplified Menu. \r\nThis change makes the the simplified menu aligned to the timing variant.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with a description of the feature proposed or problem addressed, specifying:\r\n  - what changes are expected in the output if any, \r\n  - what other PRs or externals it depends upon if any,\r\n  - link to any additional material useful to provide a documentation for this PR (slides, JIRA tickets, related pull requestes, hypernews, TWiki or Indico pages)  -->\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with a description of which tests have been performed to verify the correctness of the PR, including the eventual addition of new code for testing like unit tests, test configurations, additions or updates to the runTheMatrix test workflows -->\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

I'd argue that this these\r\ncomments are confusing an should be removed: if a package has a\r\ndependency it's because headers from that dependency are included, so no\r\nneed to argue with the UBSAN builds.\r\n\r\nBoth in the `CalibTracker/SiStripHitEfficiency`  and\r\n`DQM/TrackerRemapper` BuildFiles, the packages indeed include headers\r\nfrom `DataFormats/Scalers`, so arguing with UBSAN builds is completely\r\nredundant.\r\n\r\nA good example for why these comments are confusing was the BuildFile in\r\n`DQMOffline/MuonDPG` that package doesn't actually depend on\r\n`DataFormats/Scalers` as far as I can tell, but because the BuildFile\r\nwas copy-pasted from `DQM/TrackerRemapper` it included the comment about\r\nUBSAN builds which was not even applicable. That's why I didn't clean\r\nthat BuildFile in #36834, but instead make this separate commit to\r\nelaborate the arguments.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCMSSW compiles.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nNo backport intended.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1643747141", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "alca-pending", "geometry-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 36855, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Clean DQMOffline/MuonDPG/BuildFile.xml and remove UBSAN comments", "updated_at": "1643747899", "user": "guitargeek"}

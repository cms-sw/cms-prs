In the unlikely case 4/6 planes are damaged no track is normally recostructed. \r\nWith this PR, a special 2 plane reconstruction is introduced to recover tracks also in these pathologic situations.\r\nThe dedicated 2-plane-track reconstruction is activated if 4/6 planes are fully masked in the channel mask inside DB.\r\nThis strategy recovers tracks, is double counting safe, is triggered by DB objects (channel mask).  \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nPrivate tests on Run3 and Run2 data show that the special reco is triggered if and only if 4/6 plane in a detector package are masked.\r\n136 WFs with GT conditions show no changes, as expected (no 4 masked planes condition in any current GT).\r\n\r\nNo backport currently expected.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1676011191", "comments": 38, "commits": 8, "created_at": "1675421523", "deletions": 47, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "urgent", "code-checks-approved", "ctpps"], "merge_commit_sha": "8e150d440e98b897c1c063bfec755e84e9dc08be", "merged_at": "1676011191", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "number": 40683, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 16, "state": "closed", "title": "PPS pixel track reco in bad pots", "updated_at": "1676011191", "user": "fabferro"}

Test scrips now rely on TCDS FED, and include unpacker\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested with new \"fakeBU\" FED ID generator (incorporated in automated unit test for this module), manually with sample of raw event (file) and in test HLT-like cluster.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 11, "closed_at": "1597402635", "comments": 44, "commits": 12, "created_at": "1593441556", "deletions": 36, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "daq-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "b09cc87a76750c846d4290cdf2d8be9c8747bdf0", "merged_at": "1597402635", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 30457, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 7, "state": "closed", "title": "TCDS multi-fed support in DAQ and unpacker", "updated_at": "1597402635", "user": "smorovic"}

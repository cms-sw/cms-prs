Correspondingly, Castor and Totem are removed from the geometries. The removal of Castor requires several customizations, which are added to the `phase2_common` Era.\n\nI also did a bit of reorganization in `Configuration/Geometry` based on an earlier comment from @ianna.\n\nUnfortunately, I could not figure out a nice way to get Eras to remove EDAlias modules, so the deprecated `isChosen` feature is used for now.\n\n@boudoul, this will conflict with #15662, so one of us will have to rebase at some point.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 14, "closed_at": "1473669681", "comments": 14, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1473100680", "deletions": 60, "labels": ["comparison-available", "geometry-approved", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "ec076f0644585673b9dbdf6cc5661d5e47bb7fd8", "merged_at": "1473669681", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 15738, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "PostLS2 beampipe for Phase2", "updated_at": "1473681253", "user": "kpedro88"}

It returns nothing with result of failing in later steps or in offline analysis when we try to access them. This is important for samples with PU=0 were the possibility to have events w/o tracks is non-negligible.\r\nSolution: Straightforward just added the empty containers. The change is transparent, just the minimum to prevent the crashes.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

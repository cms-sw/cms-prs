This merges a few topics : \n1. Adding only b-tagging to the EITopPAG but nothing else (https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/678)\n2. Adding the e/gamma changes to the GsfElectron (https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/156)\n3. Adding Volker's fixes to make it compatible (https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/666)\n\nAnd finally this has a few additions of its own to bring everything together: \n1. In PFElectronTranslator, the isolation from pileup is actually filled. I also fixed a bug from topic branch 666. The python file was not in sync with the EDProducer for the names of the isolation variables.\n2. And of course, I changed EITopPAG top projection to use the updated variables. \n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 17, "closed_at": "1378883988", "comments": 7, "commits": 33, "created_at": "1377885304", "deletions": 96, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "0e42ddfd29bc20cbadbc32ed4f6b50c6bafd8d8a", "merged_at": "1378883988", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_0_0_pre4", "number": 680, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "EITopPAG updates, merging with E/Gamma features", "updated_at": "1404112918", "user": "rappoccio"}

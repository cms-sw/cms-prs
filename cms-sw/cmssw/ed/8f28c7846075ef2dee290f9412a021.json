I profit of that to re-adjust the commands for event contents to cope with no SCAL in Run3 that were leftover from https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/38415 and https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/38590. \r\nThis is done in commit 7ef7e844883b23107c0b67e5cdcaf3947df7d856.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRun two typical workflows for Run-3 and Phase-2 with\r\n\r\n```\r\nrunTheMatrix.py -l 11634.0,20834.0 -t 4 -j 8 --ibeos\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd tested the event content of `TkAlMinBias` indeed changes as expected.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

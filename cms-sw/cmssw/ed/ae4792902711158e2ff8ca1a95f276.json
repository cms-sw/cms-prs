This allows the user to investigate the properties of the truth-track (i.e. the TrackingParticle) of which the history is being calculated with this code. \n\nThis functionality is needed in the BTV group to easily monitor possible differences between reco-quantities and truth-level information form tracks of different origins (BWeakDecays, CWeakDecays, ...)\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1477382503", "comments": 25, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1476964750", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "3314a689841efd2cabbe4b7c79f5a63b9af590a6", "merged_at": "1477382503", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 16280, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Added functionality to TrackHistory.cc(.h) to get matched TrackingParticle to the Track", "updated_at": "1477382503", "user": "smoortga"}

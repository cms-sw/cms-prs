Currently, I only added it for one PD and 2018C/D data, that should be enough to catch the obvious problems. We could do the full combinatoric expansion as for the 136 WFs as well.\r\n\r\nAs expected, this WF fails at the moment, as far as I see for a different issue than the ones that @cerminar observed. PRs to fix the crashes will follow. We can wait with integrating this until all plugins are fixed for multi-run harvesting.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1541190518", "comments": 20, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1539847139", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "operations-approved", "orp-approved", "pdmv-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "2a7b21c5ccb2b363258ea8eb287bdc4658123613", "merged_at": "1541190518", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_4_X", "number": 24920, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "Add Workflow for multi-run harvesting", "updated_at": "1541190523", "user": "schneiml"}

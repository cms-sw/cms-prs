It only affects the new mixing (not default), and the code compiles and runs even so.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "changed_files": 18, "closed_at": "1391714357", "comments": 8, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1391693187", "deletions": 128, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fastsim-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "33709fe7470180a852aa5c5d1a3583c969e86251", "merged_at": "1391714357", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_1_0_pre5", "number": 2330, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Preparation for new mixing part 8", "updated_at": "1465485044", "user": "giamman"}

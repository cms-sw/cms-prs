That resolves two FIXME items and currently passes a short matrix (testing full matrix). If you look into `ESCondObjectContainer` it raises a question. All operations on it checks for `EcalPreshower`, thus maybe design of container is wrong (C++ static type checking is not utilized). Actually both `operator[]` and `find` should never even check for `EcalPreshower`. I assume class contract states that only `EcalPreshower` can be in the container. Check `insert`.\n\nI would suggest to drop checks, because `insert` already guarantees all are  `EcalPreshower`.\n\nI will update after a feedback.\n\nRegarding `struct ESPedestal`. You don't need getter methods, it's a struct, all members are public by default.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1385030493", "comments": 11, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1384944408", "deletions": 45, "labels": ["alca-approved", "db-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "bc6446114c6c2d22c78d035157c118150641bcfc", "merged_at": "1385030493", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_0_0_pre9", "number": 1533, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Const fix in CondFormats/ESObjects", "updated_at": "1385030493", "user": "davidlt"}

The behaviour when the `muIdx` field is not explicitly set should be identical to the current one.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nBackport of #38035 as requested in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/38035#issuecomment-1140486569.\r\n\r\nWould like this in for the DQM at P5.", "branch": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1654112039", "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1653847781", "deletions": 7, "labels": ["l1-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "backport-ok"], "merge_commit_sha": "5415b2d3ff07a551cc320ec7640ad5f8d498e18d", "merged_at": "1654112039", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 38117, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "[12_3_X] Compute muon index bits using idx from dataformat", "updated_at": "1654112039", "user": "dinyar"}

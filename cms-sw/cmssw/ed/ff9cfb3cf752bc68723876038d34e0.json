This is shown by the plot : \r\n![comparison_tklayout_cmssw_sim](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11192654/19892450/3fb00fce-a045-11e6-9a4c-d3f50b6478d8.gif)\r\n\r\nAfter some investigation, I found out that in one cfg file in tkLayout, the pixel chip capacitors materials is not assigned any CMSSW destination volume, whereas it should be added to the pixel description.\r\n\r\nAfter doing the corresponding fix, I get a really good match between CMSSW and tkLayout, which tends to show this was the only significant issue.\r\nThe results are enclosed : \r\n![material_budget_tklayout_versus_cmssw_sim](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11192654/19892821/1bc9a38e-a047-11e6-8139-46c2dcb9efde.gif)\r\n\r\nSummary : \r\nThis PR adds Pixel Chip Capacitors materials to Phase II Pixel description, and provides a match between CMSSW sim MB and tkLayout MB.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1478070648", "comments": 16, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1478007359", "deletions": 136, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "57e83a6fbe26774338c0c44c134850ffced5468a", "merged_at": "1478070648", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 16410, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Adedd Pixel Chip Capacitors materials to Phase II Pixel", "updated_at": "1478081292", "user": "ghugo83"}

The collections are not actually missing, but the logic to use them includes a permanent `&& false` lockout that was added in #3967.  I think it was originally to stop the Shashlik failing at that point rather than taking EEOccupancyTask out of the sequence for Shashlik.\n\nThe other workflows all seem okay, so either EEOccupancyTask was already taken out for Shashlik or the sections of code are not actually a problem.  HGCal workflows do not run validation anyway because of the memory overhead.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1433959456", "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1433942570", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "dqm-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "6d8d6430fed89e6a54bdacd32ba62b570bb40e7a", "merged_at": "1433959456", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "number": 9545, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Remove error messages about missing collections from 2017 validation sequence", "updated_at": "1434954016", "user": "mark-grimes"}

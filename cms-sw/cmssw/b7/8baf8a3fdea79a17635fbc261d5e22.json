The pedestal constraint in HCAL Method 2 reconstruction did not account for this increase, leading to biased energy for some RecHits. Now it is included, but only enabled for Phase2. An additional parameter is added to the Method 2 parameter set, which must eventually be propagated to HLT separately (since M2 parameters are not kept in fillDescriptions).\r\n\r\nSee the presentation https://indico.cern.ch/event/664043/contributions/2713101/attachments/1519347/2372809/hcal_raddam_phase2_status_sept_6_2017.pdf and this plot that demonstrates improvement in jet energy response:\r\n![JER w/ M2 fix](http://kjplanet.com/pr/RelValRelRspVsRefPt_JetEta0.5to1.3_ak4pfl2l3.png)\r\n\r\nThis PR will be backported to 93X for inclusion in the HGCal TDR release (hopefully).\r\n\r\nattn: @abdoulline @mariadalfonso @hatakeyamak ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1505194899", "comments": 28, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1504794782", "deletions": 16, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "hlt-approved", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "ba83c88a9ba5d36a7c050dd853e8f2cbcb68b8da", "merged_at": "1505194899", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_4_X", "number": 20422, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "include dark current contribution in M2 pedestal constraint for Phase2", "updated_at": "1505194899", "user": "kpedro88"}

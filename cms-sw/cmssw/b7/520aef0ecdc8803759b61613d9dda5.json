The following sub-sections provide an overview of the public API changes between Xerces-C++ 2 series and this release.\n- A number of DOM interfaces (DOMLSInput, DOMLSOuput, DOMLSParser, DOMLSSerializer, DOMConfiguration, etc.) were added as part of the the final DOM Level 3 specification conformance work\n- Many public interfaces that used int/long types to represent memory-related sizes, counts, indexes, etc., have been modified to use the 64-bit safe XMLSize_t type instead\n-  All APIs marked as deprecated in Xerces-C++ 2 series have been removed in this release. In particular deprecated DOM (depdom) as well as COM support have been removed.\n\nFurthermore, a number of DOM interfaces (DOMBuilder, DOMWriter, DOMInputSource, etc.) were replaced as part of the the final DOM Level 3 specification conformance work.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_ROOT64_X", "changed_files": 303, "closed_at": "1464096840", "comments": 16, "commits": 106, "created_at": "1463732086", "deletions": 1181, "labels": ["alca-pending", "analysis-pending", "comparison-pending", "core-pending", "db-pending", "dqm-pending", "fastsim-pending", "generators-pending", "geometry-pending", "hlt-pending", "l1-pending", "new-package-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending"], "number": 14585, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": " Migrating from Xerces-C++ 2.8.0 to Xerces-C++ 3.x", "updated_at": "1464096840", "user": "ianna"}

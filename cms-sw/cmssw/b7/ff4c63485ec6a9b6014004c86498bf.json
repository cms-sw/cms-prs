This is a first commit to let you know I'm working on this and to get initial feedback. I hope to revamp the whole PFAlgo.cc from the logging point of view (also removing useless comments etc) in the next few days.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nWIP, please don't trigger tests yet on this PR.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1564037080", "comments": 71, "commits": 14, "created_at": "1562899824", "deletions": 578, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "151ea7cb5ea72c33c0d4337195ce4ef4b497c42c", "merged_at": "1564037080", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27505, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 9, "state": "closed", "title": "PFAlgo thread-safe logging", "updated_at": "1564037081", "user": "jpata"}

This is the reason: \nFor pPb analyses, we use pp-reconstruction, so HI scenario is not wanted. \nOn the other hand, the same mixing workflow is applied, using the option --himix, and HI event content (which is a strict superset of pp event content) is needed to keep the signal event (hiSignal).\nTherefore the scenario has to be decoupled from himix, but EventContent should always be imposed.\nThe fix pull-requested here does exactly the above, and nothing else.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_5_3_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1399386036", "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1399379264", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "2980614fcfbddb873b645539fcbadc3524a0259b", "merged_at": "1399386036", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_5_3_X", "number": 3694, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "scenario HeavyIons and --himix decoupled", "updated_at": "1399386036", "user": "yetkinyilmaz"}

Because of the good track granularity, many fake muons can be reconstructed as a good muon. In order to reduce the fake muon, a study is performed to use track only isolation in the PF muon algorithm. \n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1423088767", "comments": 19, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1422971776", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "c8a79f4ba485c493f14cc3dbad123dd990073bf6", "merged_at": "1423088767", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 7529, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Changed to use track only isolation for PFmuon", "updated_at": "1423088768", "user": "gbyu"}

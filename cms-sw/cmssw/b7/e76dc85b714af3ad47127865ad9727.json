While testing this routine, I found three missing dictionaries for persistent classes.  This has not caused a problem, because all three classes are instances of std::vector<T>, and root can usually handle std::vector<T> without a dictionary if it has a dictionary for T.  However, such handling is less efficient without a dictionary. This pull request adds the missing dictionaries.\nThis pull request is totally technical, so signatures should be bypassed if not signed in a reasonable amount of time.\nI tested this pull request with the short relval matrix and saw no errors.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_2_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1403634976", "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1403542603", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "988ac305d1cc16e0f807a4d3337194cb6aa31d5c", "merged_at": "1403634976", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_2_0_pre1", "number": 4361, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add missing dictionaries", "updated_at": "1403641415", "user": "wmtan"}

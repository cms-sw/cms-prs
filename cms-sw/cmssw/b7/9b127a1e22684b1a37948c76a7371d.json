The following list of parameters is enough, \r\n- `isFromL1`\r\n- `mvaFileB`\r\n- `mvaFileE`\r\n- `mvaScaleMeanB`\r\n- `mvaScaleStdB`\r\n- `mvaScaleMeanE`\r\n- `mvaScaleStdE`\r\n\r\nprovided one configures every module correctly. A check is added throwing an exception in case the MVA model is not compatible with the value of \"isFromL1\".\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n`addOnTests.py` runs fine with this PR\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

Further,\nthe timeout can now be set by the CMSSW pset and the site local\nconfig service.\n\nIt appears that timeouts were never set for fallback files;\nthis issue is now fixed.\n\nWhenever a ReadV error occurs, raise a CMSSW exception; do not\nallow this to be cast down to a ROOT warning.  Exception information\nis improved so the last Xrootd server message (or timeouts) are\nrecorded.\n\nFinally, this fixes an older bug in XrdReadv.cc which causes the\ntransaction timeout to not be reset at the beginning of ReadV calls.\nThis causes the XrdAdaptor to throw an exception on ReadV\ncalls if it has been more than the timeout (default, 8 hours) between\nRead calls (which did reset the transaction timeout).\n\nThis is a backport of PR #5714 per request from @davidlange6 \n", "branch": "CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1412789570", "comments": 4, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1412770242", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "994f0501b8a6812b4ef8a6f525fa396f3ec3f5d1", "merged_at": "1412789570", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "number": 5742, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Implement timeouts for the Xrootd client.", "updated_at": "1412789570", "user": "bbockelm"}

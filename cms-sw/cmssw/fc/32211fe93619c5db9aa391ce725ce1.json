These need to be fixed in 7_4_X\nRather than deciphering the mess and adding deletes where needed, it was much better and safer just to use smart pointers, rather than bare pointers, for the data members owned by this class.\nWhile I was at it, it was much easier and safer also add the consumes interface, so this PR also includes it.\nThe justifications are:\n1) This class already had the consumes interface partially implemented in 7_4_X.\n2) This keeps the files  similar or identical in 7_4_X and 7_5_X.\n3) The fixes for the memory leaks touched many more lines of code than those for the consumes interface.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1428388522", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1428091399", "deletions": 48, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fastsim-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "c5f0aeaa70782bb6ee678e4a0a37a3aeb8280fd9", "merged_at": "1428388522", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 8663, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "fix memory leaks in FastTSGFromPropagation", "updated_at": "1428943827", "user": "wmtan"}

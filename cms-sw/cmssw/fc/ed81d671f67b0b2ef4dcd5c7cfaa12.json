It only makes the definitions of the nested class/struct public.\nThis has been tested with checkdeps -a and the relval matrix.\n\nIn some cases, the declarations were moved to keep the public and private sections of the class each contiguous.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1382015101", "comments": 14, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1381934028", "deletions": 28, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "6e1e80c1c586b717f86f399c655e760c7c37d97d", "merged_at": "1382015101", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_0_0_pre6", "number": 1089, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "For ROOT6 dictionary generation, nested class/struct must be public.", "updated_at": "1406902377", "user": "wmtan"}

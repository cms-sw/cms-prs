The changes are: \n- We are \"switching\" from CHS to PUPPI in AK8 jets. Previously we stored CHS jets and matched PUPPI to those objects, storing values in user floats. Now we store PUPPI jets and store CHS values in user floats instead. \n- We dropped the CHS subjets, saving about 0.5% of the event size. \n- We added a single b-tagging discriminator to the subjets. \n\nTests ran: runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all -j 10, scram b runtests \n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": "1472449648", "comments": 29, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1470937466", "deletions": 200, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-available", "dqm-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "c5db1f8951917f40215d8f4960c296ddc6a17a70", "merged_at": "1472449648", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 15437, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Jets for 81x MiniAOD", "updated_at": "1472449649", "user": "rappoccio"}

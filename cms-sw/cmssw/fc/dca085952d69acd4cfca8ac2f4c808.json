Changes include:\r\n\r\nRemoval of track transformation step, using instead the L1GTTInputProducer and L1TrackSelectionProducer\r\nUse AP_FIXED data types for internal Et calculation, simplifying code and avoiding unnecessary conversions\r\nUse TTTrack_word phi granularity extended to 2 Pi instead of internal representation\r\nRewrite Cordic function to use ap_fixed removing extra conversions\r\nCordic now runs between -pi and pi rather than 0 and 2 pi as per output specification\r\n\r\n### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested against FW, currently matches px and py calcuations as well as MET and MET phi. Differences between Emulation and Simulation are ongoing but going forwards with emulator and FW matching these differences can be investigated while also updating the FW.\r\n\r\nSupersedes https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/39725, which got conflicts after merging https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/39422\r\n\r\nPorting local https://github.com/cms-l1t-offline/cmssw/pull/1049", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 15, "comments": 11, "commits": 11, "created_at": "1666629856", "deletions": 576, "labels": ["l1-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_6_X", "number": 39836, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 6, "state": "open", "title": "[L1T] Phase-2, track MET update for FW sync (new)", "updated_at": "1667410675", "user": "cecilecaillol"}

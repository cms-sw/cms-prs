It's in the logic that chooses the best simHit among those that match a recHit.  It is relevant for only about 10% of recHits.  The effect is undetectable in the matching residual plots with 500 3-TeV-jet events (no PU).  I made a test filling the histograms only for the recHits with multiple simHits, and find that fixing the bug makes some improvement in some of the residual plots.\n![screen shot 2015-01-25 at 11 22 11 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4702771/5895919/1dc8cb7a-a4e9-11e4-91ca-0e0d2aacfcc7.png)\n.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1422264719", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1422249915", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "e5b3034d18fe7478cf1eb0fc2af9a70a3bfea4cd", "merged_at": "1422264719", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 7362, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix bug chosing closest simHit", "updated_at": "1424636645", "user": "wmtford"}

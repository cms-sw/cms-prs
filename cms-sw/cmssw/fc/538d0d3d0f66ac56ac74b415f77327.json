This pull request adds the option to run ParameterSetBlobProducer at begin Run to create the ParameterSetBlobs once and then have all the OutputModules use that information. This decreased the time spent making the blobs from 147s in the orginal job to 4s.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe test configuration I was using ran fine both with and without ParameterSetBlobProducer added.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 13, "closed_at": "1587134035", "comments": 39, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1587038557", "deletions": 25, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "core-approved", "daq-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "3548ccd3af86516a2b8905263ceef573e0d3ddb1", "merged_at": "1587134035", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 29492, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Decrease begin Run startup time for HLT", "updated_at": "1587134036", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

Currently this boolean is used only by `Tracer` Service in `(pre|post)OpenFile`. The `Tracer` Service is the only user of the same boolean in `(pre|post)CloseFile`. We concluded that these printouts are not that useful (they don't affect framework's scheduling). This PR removes those printouts, and the boolean argument for the `(pre|post)(Open|Close)File` signals.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 16, "comments": 3, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1638898630", "deletions": 73, "labels": ["core-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved", "heterogeneous-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 36400, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Remove usedFallback argument from (pre|post)(Open|Close)File", "updated_at": "1638900400", "user": "makortel"}

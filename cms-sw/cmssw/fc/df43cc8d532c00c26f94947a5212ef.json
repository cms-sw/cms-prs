If someone can provide an alternative for this then please let me know.\r\n\r\nSimulation:\r\n* A long time ago we discovered a small bug in the CASTOR noise addition (during digi step), which would overestimate the noise, especially in case of pA and AA collisions. Now finally I managed to prepare the code for submission. This change has already been validated within CASTOR group. These classes are used during production whenever the CASTOR simulation is executed/included in the config.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "comments": 12, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1520001973", "deletions": 66, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_1_X", "number": 22424, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "CASTOR reconstruction and simulation updates", "updated_at": "1520505876", "user": "hvanhaev"}

Since the code was only testing the\nexistence of a ParameterSet it was easy to replace with existsAs.\n\nNOTE: It looks to me like this code is completely unnecessary.\nThe loop just before this one goes over the exact same parameter names\nand asks for them as tracked parameters. If that succeeds, they can't\nalso be untracked so the code modified does nothing. If that fails\nan exception is thrown and the code modified is never called.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1394525693", "comments": 4, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1394205971", "deletions": 24, "labels": ["dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "24f9e3932aa7d9b741e144ff675ad10da6fc1cb6", "merged_at": "1394525693", "merged_by": "nclopezo", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_1_0_pre5", "number": 2772, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Replaced try...catch with ParameterSet::existsAs calls", "updated_at": "1395085112", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

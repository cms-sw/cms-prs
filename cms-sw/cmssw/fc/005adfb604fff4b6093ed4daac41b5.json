Updates are generally trivial and there should be no any visible effects of them (except for the rare event numbers with > 32 bits). \n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_3_X", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1415363542", "comments": 6, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1415286576", "deletions": 10, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "0933dba3bc3f7d23112b88c18f84ca8cc2ea6d42", "merged_at": "1415363542", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_3_X", "number": 6250, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Update types of event/run/lumi in Muon/Tau/HI", "updated_at": "1415363542", "user": "StoyanStoynev"}

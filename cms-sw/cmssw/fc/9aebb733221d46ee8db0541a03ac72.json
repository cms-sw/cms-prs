The PR might still evolve but this should be the first working version ready for review.\n\nMost changes are technical in nature to allow adding b-tag discriminators with HIP mitigation enabled to slimmedJets in MiniAOD which is the only change this PR introduces. All the changes should be completely transparent to the standard reconstruction.\n\nThis PR also fixes a bug in the way c-tag-specific IVF secondary vertices are handled in PAT.\n\n**Update (Aug. 25, 2016):** PR updated according to what was presented in https://indico.cern.ch/event/562813/contributions/2279246/attachments/1326456/1991839/BTV_developments_plans.pdf In summary, the relaxed track selection for HIP mitigation is now the default b-tag track selection and the legacy tight selection can be enabled in PAT through a jetTools.py switch.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 9, "closed_at": "1472547231", "comments": 54, "commits": 22, "created_at": "1470861276", "deletions": 99, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "7e2b68e73bd2e50d9155743c094e2ff5aa2bb476", "merged_at": "1472547231", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 15421, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 9, "state": "closed", "title": "btag HIP mitigation + ctag bugfix", "updated_at": "1472548307", "user": "ferencek"}

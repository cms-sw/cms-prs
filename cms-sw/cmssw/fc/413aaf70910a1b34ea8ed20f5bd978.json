We discussed with @fioriNTU , and it should be fine to remove this.\r\n- `std::string HDQMInspectorConfigSiStrip::translateDetId(const uint32_t) const` seems not to be used anywhere - neither is the corresponding method in `HDQMInspectorConfigTracking`, so I would propose to remove both (together with the corresponding pure virtual method in the base class). In fact without these methods there is no difference between `HDQMInspectorConfigSiStrip` and `HDQMInspectorConfigTracking` any more - and I found no uses of any `HDQMInspectorConfig.*` (except for `HDQMInspectorConfigSiPixel` [here](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/e739f383ae7dc92506e31b0ef33212f548eee0ca/DQMServices/Diagnostic/test/dummyTest/SiPixelPlottingExample.C#L21), but I find no definition of that class, so that looks like an obsolete macro), so maybe these classes can be removed completely?\r\n\r\nCC: @OlivierBondu @alesaggio @vidalm ; tracked at https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/19398", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": "1503501671", "comments": 9, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1503385198", "deletions": 146, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "c585de67a291c0fea4a1c5d0a522ead42adaa014", "merged_at": "1503501671", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_3_X", "number": 20223, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Remove obsolete methods in SiStrip DQM that use subdetector-DetId classes", "updated_at": "1503501671", "user": "pieterdavid"}

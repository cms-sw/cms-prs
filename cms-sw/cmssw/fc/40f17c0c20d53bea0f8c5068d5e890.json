The initial check is done here:\r\nhttps://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/e5ac8e997d5565e91eea5eaa91884a2b17a0fde4/DQM/EcalMonitorTasks/plugins/EcalDQMonitorTask.cc#L46-L48\r\n`task->analyze()` here needs to return `false` so the collections aren't consumed.\r\n\r\nThe `consumes` functions are then called inside this function:\r\nhttps://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/e5ac8e997d5565e91eea5eaa91884a2b17a0fde4/DQM/EcalMonitorTasks/plugins/EcalDQMonitorTask.cc#L64\r\n\r\nThe switches are moved to make sure that unused collections are not consumed if they are individually toggled.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles. The switches are now in the same spot as the \"master\" switch `runGpuTask` which we already know functions as expected.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

The cleaning can always be done easily a posteriori using the cross-matching indices stored. The cross-cleaning module is kept in place in case people want to use it in private productions.\r\n\r\nNanoAOD file size increase from these changes is 0.02 kb/event.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRan with `runTheMatrix.py --what nano --site \"\" -l 2500.601`", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 10, "comments": 10, "commits": 10, "created_at": "1669572714", "deletions": 68, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-rejected", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "xpog-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "number": 40162, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Nano: fix and additions to collection matching, remove cross-cleaning", "updated_at": "1669637830", "user": "swertz"}

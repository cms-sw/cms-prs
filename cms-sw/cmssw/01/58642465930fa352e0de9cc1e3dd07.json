The cleaning can always be done easily a posteriori using the cross-matching indices stored. The cross-cleaning module is kept in place in case people want to use it in private productions.\r\n\r\nNanoAOD file size increase from these changes is 0.02 kb/event.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRan with `runTheMatrix.py --what nano --site \"\" -l 2500.601`", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 11, "closed_at": "1670333401", "comments": 50, "commits": 14, "created_at": "1669572714", "deletions": 73, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved", "xpog-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "04a2b8e697549d161ca73c2b4566322aecba43a1", "merged_at": "1670333400", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "number": 40162, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Nano: fix and additions to collection matching, remove cross-cleaning", "updated_at": "1670333401", "user": "swertz"}

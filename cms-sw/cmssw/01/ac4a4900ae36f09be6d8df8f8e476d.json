Instead of patching the current code it is forseeen that the restructured DIGI step co-exists temporarily in CMSSW while being validated by the DPG. \r\nSuch staggered discussion was discussed after the presentation in the SIM meting of 3/12/2022 (https://indico.cern.ch/event/1101457/#67-hgcal-simulation-status) and more recently in the DPG (https://indico.cern.ch/event/1166838/#3-challenges-and-progress-towa)\r\n\r\nContent: This PR introduces a realistic HGCROC channel data format according to the specs. It will be used as a baseline for the restructuring of the DIGI step for HGCAL, but it's not yet used elsewhere in CMSSW and as such it can't be tested with any workflow. Instead a unit test is provided with this DataFormat to make sure it performs as expected. The PR includes the move of the PHGCSimAccumulator.h class to this new directory as it will be re-used in the restructured DIGI step. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nUsing the unit test/HGCROCSampleTest.cpp provided with the PR ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 13, "closed_at": "1656936304", "comments": 19, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1656407509", "deletions": 13, "labels": ["simulation-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "upgrade-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "65be446ab1afc3c883f1f4fa645e824abc4cfa86", "merged_at": "1656936304", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 38538, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "HGC Realistic DIGIS - part I", "updated_at": "1656936304", "user": "pfs"}

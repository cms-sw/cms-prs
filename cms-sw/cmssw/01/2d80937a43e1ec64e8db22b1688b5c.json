In principle this could be back ported to `14_2_X` and `14_1_X` given the final production is happening in `14_0_19` but, unless a problem arises (as it is with https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/41932), I'll just keep them. \r\n\r\nInstead of completely removing them I prefer to comment the tests just to keep track of what was the final setup (without having to dig the git history).\r\n\r\nFYI: @makortel", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 6, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1733140852", "deletions": 9, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "pdmv-approved", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_0_X", "number": 46843, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Disable 2022/2023 MC Tests", "updated_at": "1733147470", "user": "AdrianoDee"}

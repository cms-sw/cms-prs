Previously, one query was made per event, although only the run and lumi information is used in the query. This PR only performs one query per run-lumi combination and therefore can significantly improve the speed of this script when many events are picked from the same run and lumi block.\r\nIn addition, the code has been cleaned up and the old C-style string formatting has been replaced with modern format strings.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTo check whether this works, several tests were carried out in interactive mode and the unit test was also adapted so that it works again.\r\nIn crab mode, it was only tested that the same submission files are generated as before, but submission via crab was not tested.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1753887472", "comments": 11, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1741871812", "deletions": 204, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "88cd853ec69b247986ae3c0a3f4bb64a9e30f00b", "merged_at": "1753887472", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 47591, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "edmPickEvents.py improved", "updated_at": "1753887473", "user": "winterchristian"}

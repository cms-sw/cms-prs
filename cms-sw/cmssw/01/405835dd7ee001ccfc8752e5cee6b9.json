ROOT should fix this eventually, but this tag set modifies two classes.h files and two classes_def.xml files to be in Linux format instead of DOS format by removing the tailing carriage return on each line.\nThis is the only change in this pull request.\n\nThis request is purely technical and totally trivial. Please bypass the signatures if not promptly signed.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1381264356", "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1381248556", "deletions": 375, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "f58f796c558ad9419dede35b85cab438654faf42", "merged_at": "1381264356", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_0_0_pre6", "number": 1024, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Dictionary files in DOS format break current ROOT6", "updated_at": "1381504215", "user": "wmtan"}

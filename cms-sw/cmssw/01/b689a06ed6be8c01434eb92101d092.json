This change will affect positions of the senstive volumes, even if it is just a few um.\r\n\r\n- For BPIX (thanks @zucchett )\r\n   - Correct material for Flange4. This significantly increases the mass of this volume, the old material was incorrect. \r\n   - Changs to densities to match measurements at PSI\r\n   - Changes to the Sector D shield material.\r\n\r\nThe renaming in 171f8856dbeaf0e2090725aac6dbc3 might affect Phase2. We could omit this but actually we should really just make sure that Phase1 and Phase2 are independent.\r\n\r\nThe changes to the material budget are validated to be in the expected range. No new overlaps are created.\r\nSensor positions change by 5-10um in FPIX.\r\n@veszpv ", "branch": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "changed_files": 12, "closed_at": "1485175488", "comments": 12, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1484830389", "deletions": 21, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "orp-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "number": 17209, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Pixel Material Budget Changes", "updated_at": "1485175488", "user": "schneiml"}

The correctness of the produced histograms was verified using the TBrowser root feature.\r\n\r\n[mtopbtagmuon.pdf](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/files/14482372/mtopbtagmuon.pdf)\r\n[mtopbtagelectron.pdf](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/files/14482373/mtopbtagelectron.pdf)\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1709561582", "deletions": 33, "labels": ["dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 44299, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Updated btags and Working Points for Top Production mini AOD DQM ", "updated_at": "1709793436", "user": "dsidirop1"}

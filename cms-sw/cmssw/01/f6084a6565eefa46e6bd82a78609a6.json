The tracks added are:\r\n * The main track of GsfElectronCore\r\n * All ambiguous tacks of GsfElectron (if there are any)\r\n\r\nChange in the file size was estimated with *test/patMiniAOD_standard_cfg.py* script on two RelVal samples: **TTbar** and **ZtoEE**, based on 500 events:\r\n * In TTbar sample the increase is from 32470 Kbytes to 32524 Kbytes (0.17%). Increase per event: 108 bytes.\r\n * In ZEE sample the increase from 25427 Kbytes to 25460 Kbytes (0.13%). Increase per event: 65 bytes.\r\n\r\nThis addition was presented in [X-POG meeting on 18-Oct-2016](https://indico.cern.ch/event/575788/), in [this slides](https://indico.cern.ch/event/575788/contributions/2343082/attachments/1356862/2051472/Zenz-DalitzMiniAODNeeds-XPOG-v1.pdf).  \r\nThis was also privately discussed with @arizzi @gpetruc @sethzenz @bendavid.\r\n\r\nThe intent for this code to be used for miniAOD of 2017 data/MC and legacy re-miniAOD of 2016 data.\r\n\r\nThis supersedes pull #19597 \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 11, "closed_at": "1503591665", "comments": 75, "commits": 9, "created_at": "1501262557", "deletions": 28, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "5d9892889f68e5ca315afc3b31869460844e9db2", "merged_at": "1503591665", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_3_X", "number": 19964, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 23, "state": "closed", "title": "Adding reduced GsfTracks to miniAOD", "updated_at": "1503591665", "user": "andreypz"}

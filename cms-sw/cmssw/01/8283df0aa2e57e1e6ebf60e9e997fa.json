The problem was found by the static analyzer. Rather than fix the fragile delete, I switched to code to use container objects which manage their own memory. This also meant changing a function to return a std::vector<int> rather than an int\\* and requiring the caller to remember to delete the item (there wrong delete was being used there anyway).\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1387214599", "comments": 4, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1386872983", "deletions": 26, "labels": ["dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "fce10e441bb35aa4d2fc22f267a1d43b77bc0b3f", "merged_at": "1387214599", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_0_0_pre11", "number": 1793, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fixed memory problem in PrimaryVertexAnalyzer4PU", "updated_at": "1387469519", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

They affect the track-based per-cm histograms in SiStripMonitorTrack. The off-track cluster based plots are unaffected.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1456996756", "comments": 8, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1456475490", "deletions": 35, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "d14cbbc98d43455c48d1361cf7b2b7afc3fe9bc2", "merged_at": "1456996756", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 13485, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add cuts to SiStripMonitorTrack (8_1_X version)", "updated_at": "1456996757", "user": "schneiml"}

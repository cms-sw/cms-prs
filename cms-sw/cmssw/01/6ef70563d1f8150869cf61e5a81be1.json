(In the previous version 'PropagatorWithMaterial' was used for both propagation steps.)\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1524570434", "comments": 32, "commits": 10, "created_at": "1523299564", "deletions": 242, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 22912, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fixes to  L3 Muon OI SeedGenerator (TSGForOI) for improved efficiency", "updated_at": "1524893814", "user": "bmahakud"}

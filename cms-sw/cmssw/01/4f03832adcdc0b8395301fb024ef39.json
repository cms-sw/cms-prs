The std::string can be constructor by both of them\r\nthus causing compiler to error on it.\r\n\r\nUse static_cast to explicitly select conversion operator which would be\r\ncompatible with previous C++ standards.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: David Abdurachmanov <David.Abdurachmanov@cern.ch>", "branch": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1484985886", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1484926868", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["comparison-notrun", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved", "visualization-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "0af365c18a9b10ee9894c548f93da61d1122068c", "merged_at": "1484985886", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "number": 17230, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Use static_cast to call explicitly conversion operator on TString", "updated_at": "1484985886", "user": "davidlt"}

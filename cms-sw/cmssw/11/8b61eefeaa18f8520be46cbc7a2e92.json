Since that frozen menu is the one which has to be used for the 7.5.3+ release validation campaign and/or MC production, we will update it in the CMSSW dumps only if this pull request can be merged before those productions start (and in such a way they can more conveniently pick the updated HLT menu). If those productions are already started, we will close this ticket.\nBased on CMSSW_7_5_3\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 16, "closed_at": "1444888299", "comments": 13, "commits": 15, "created_at": "1443161721", "deletions": 5951, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "hlt-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "121cd7f1e62c83119c522c6a9c9401c4bba5bb95", "merged_at": "1444888299", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 11484, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "75X hlt25ns round5 plus updated frozenv4", "updated_at": "1445453265", "user": "perrotta"}

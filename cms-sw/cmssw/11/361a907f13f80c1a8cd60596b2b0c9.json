This time I've included a parameter to allow prompt to override the bunch spacing in configuration based on the processing scenario being used.\n\nInstead of storing this output, I suggest that this module just be run as needed. I've added it to the reco sequence, which should be sufficient for all current consumers. Eventually we'll need it in PAT as well.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 14, "closed_at": "1443688494", "comments": 26, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1443516846", "deletions": 80, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-pending", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "0b48252ff418830b2586077529701834351aab93", "merged_at": "1443688494", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 11544, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "Central bunch spacing producer", "updated_at": "1443694576", "user": "davidlange6"}

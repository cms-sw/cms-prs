EMTF will be loading new PC LUTs reflecting the real CMS geometry, and thus new LUTs and modifications to the emulator are needed to preserve data-emulator agreement.\r\n\r\nThe new LUTs are being PR-ed separately here:\r\n\r\nThis update is urgently needed for the DQM.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nAndrew for the EMTF team\r\n\r\n[1] https://indico.cern.ch/event/758694/contributions/3146645/subcontributions/263903/attachments/1719883/2776101/2018_09_20_EMTF_alignment.pdf", "branch": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "changed_files": 10, "comments": 4, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1537518082", "deletions": 63, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "l1-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 24617, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "EMTF new LCT coordinate conversion LUTs", "updated_at": "1537534228", "user": "abrinke1"}

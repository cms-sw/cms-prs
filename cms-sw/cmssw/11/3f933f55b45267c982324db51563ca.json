In 2017 workflows efficiency increases in pT 0.3-2 GeV and r 2-8 cm, and also fake and duplicate rates increase (all caused by the addition of detachedTripletStep, fake rate increase mitigated a bit by iteration reordering). The timing should stay pretty much the same, thanks to more optimal order of iterations.\n\n@rovere @VinInn \n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1464761424", "comments": 9, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1464261454", "deletions": 17, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "cfb699ca914be3970aa9b1cfe496452ec04bd548", "merged_at": "1464761424", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 14643, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "Add detachedTripletStep to phase1 tracking sequence and reorder iterations", "updated_at": "1464761424", "user": "makortel"}

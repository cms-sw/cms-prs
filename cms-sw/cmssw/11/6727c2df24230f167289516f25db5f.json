This will allow vertex fitting after data taking. Also made a quick hltPixelVertex to hltPixelTrack association and introduced the vertex index in the corresponding collection.\r\n\r\n-- while I introduced an option of reducing relevant bits to store information, the scouting track collection will need significant storage space and we will need to double check in the next iteration what exactly will be needed\r\n---> https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/3c9bd1ba78ad23447885a9bf2f54b430a18a3e24/DataFormats/TrackReco/interface/TrackBase.h#L5\r\nIndicates roughly 20 parameters are needed\r\n\r\nobservations:\r\n-- about on average 2-3% of the tracks are incorrectly associated to vertices via the method of minimising dz^2 - this is measured on ttbar events with roughly 600 tracks per event.  (the vertices are only clustered in Z)\r\n-- all tracks in the associated track collection of vertices, are quadruplets\r\n-- not all quadruplets are in the list of tracks associated to vertices\r\n-- via the matching performed in this producer, all tracks (triplets & quadruplets) will be matched to vertices if dxy^2+dz^2 < 0.015.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with a description of which tests have been performed to verify the correctness of the PR, including the eventual addition of new code for testing like unit tests, test configurations, additions or updates to the runTheMatrix test workflows -->\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with any link to  -->\r\n\r\nscram b distclean \r\ngit cms-checkdeps -a -A\r\nscram b -j 8\r\nscram b runtests\r\n\r\nscram build code-checks\r\nscram build code-format", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 19, "closed_at": "1606259137", "comments": 138, "commits": 40, "created_at": "1603881484", "deletions": 116, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "hlt-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved", "urgent"], "merge_commit_sha": "987c31a4b89c3f5e78e3ee353809f84bac3baf76", "merged_at": "1606259137", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 31962, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 42, "state": "closed", "title": "Change track muon dataformats scouting", "updated_at": "1606259137", "user": "jsalfeld"}

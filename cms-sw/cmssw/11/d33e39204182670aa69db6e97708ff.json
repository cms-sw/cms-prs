Previously each event processed by the module needed 85k allocations. Now only the first event of each stream uses that much and all subsequent only use 19 allocations.\r\n\r\nThis should strictly be a technical change and should have no effect on the results.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 28, "comments": 2, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1731099148", "deletions": 831, "labels": ["l1-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_2_X", "number": 46640, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Improve L1TMuonBarrelTrackProducer", "updated_at": "1731099180", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

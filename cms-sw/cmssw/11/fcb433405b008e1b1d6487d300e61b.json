If this PR will be backported, please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nIf merged, this PR will be backported down to (at least) the `15_0_X` cycle.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 4, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1759747513", "deletions": 67, "labels": ["l1-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "bug-fix", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_0_X", "number": 49069, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "improve handling of correlation-conditions cut values in `l1t::TriggerMenuParser`", "updated_at": "1759749603", "user": "missirol"}

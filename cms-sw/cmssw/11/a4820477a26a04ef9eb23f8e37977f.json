This one is for Harvesting changes, equivalent to the [customise_harvesting](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/CMSSW_8_0_X_2015-11-15-2300/SLHCUpgradeSimulations/Configuration/python/phase1TkCustoms.py#L139) function.\n\n**There should be no change whatsoever unless the Run2_2017 era is active** (the only top-level era that contains phase1Pixel).\n\n@atricomi, @delaere - In [DQM/SiPixelCommon/python/SiPixelOfflineDQM_client_cff.py](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/CMSSW_8_0_X_2015-11-15-2300/DQM/SiPixelCommon/python/SiPixelOfflineDQM_client_cff.py#L17) there is also a `sipixelPhase1Client` analyzer, which is now redundant (and corresponding `PixelOfflinePhase1DQMClient` sequence).  I didn't take them out though because I don't know what else relies on them, and you also might prefer to do your configuration using those.\n\n@boudoul\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1449730144", "comments": 7, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1447689553", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "4451069b557b9ded6c2a4d17f9256bba3d96542f", "merged_at": "1449730144", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 12440, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "phase1Pixel era harvesting additions", "updated_at": "1449730144", "user": "mark-grimes"}

This change will enable us to use GEMMuon for GEM efficiency measurements with the common muon POG tag and probe code in the DQM. We also require that a GEMMuon be a good TrackerMuon, as there is no use case for a separate GEMMuon which is not also a TrackerMuon, and we want to keep the fake rate low. The code to change to rechits was copied from the RPC code and adjusted to GEM.\r\n\r\nThese changes were originally proposed to the muon POG in April [1], and it was agreed the changes would be okay, assuming the fake rate wouldn't increase. We found that segments to rechits would increase the fake rate [2], so we proposed by mail to require that GEMMuon be a subset of TrackerMuon, which still allows our TnP measurement, which is the use case of GEMMuon from the GEM side.\r\n\r\n@jshlee\r\n\r\n[1] https://indico.cern.ch/event/1153168/\r\n[2] https://indico.cern.ch/event/1171113/contributions/4918837/attachments/2462011/4221295/Fake-rate-study_counting.pdf\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with a description of the feature proposed or problem addressed, specifying:\r\n  - what changes are expected in the output if any, \r\n  - what other PRs or externals it depends upon if any,\r\n  - link to any additional material useful to provide a documentation for this PR (slides, JIRA tickets, related pull requestes, hypernews, TWiki or Indico pages)  -->\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRan a ttbar workflow with the changes.

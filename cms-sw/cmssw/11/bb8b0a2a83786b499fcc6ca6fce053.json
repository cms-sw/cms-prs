This generates a data file containing a GlobalObjectMapRecord object with known content. Then it reads it. It verifies that when we read it we obtain values that match the known written values for all the data fields in the object. In particular all containers have content so all contained types are also read.\r\n\r\nIt also reads the old files in the DataFormats/L1TGlobal data repository which are listed in the shell script. The plan is that each time the data format of GlobalObjectMapRecord is modified a file will added.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis only adds a unit test in DataFormats/L1TGlobal which passes. It shouldn't affect anything else.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 7, "comments": 0, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1683324178", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["l1-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_2_X", "number": 41565, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Add unit test for GlobalObjectMapRecord format", "updated_at": "1683324202", "user": "wddgit"}

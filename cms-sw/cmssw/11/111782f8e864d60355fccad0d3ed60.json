The variables are also added to NANOAOD. \r\nSuch variables turn out to be useful to discriminate physics jets from noise. \r\n\r\nThe description of the variables and their motivation can be found in this talk: \r\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/944298/#sc-10-4-hf-noise-study-on-aod\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nrunTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos gave no error\r\nIt was explicitly checked that the variables added to MINIAOD (computed from AOD) and to NANOAOD (computed from MINIAOD) are consistent.\r\nThe code quality checks were performed. \r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nNot a backport.

N cores setting defined in workflow steps, and wmcontral read these numbers for relval production.\n- re-arrange upgrade workflows removing old 8TeV workflows. \n- phase1 workflows set to 13TeV\n- Update relval_2017 IB tests workflow list to be: [10021.0,10024.0,10025.0,10026.0,10023.0,10224.0,10225.0] \n- turn on realistic Beamspot for phase1 gen-sim, turn on phase1 GT for realistic BS, build on top of PR https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/13394\n- update phase1 gen-sim input \n- Add 3 data 2015 HighLumi run High stats workflows needed for cross POG studies\n- Add a new TTbar workflow wrapped from an ext-gen workflow, starting from LHE generation (then pythia gen-sim, digi, reco, etc.,).\n- Update minibias inputs for mixing and premixing.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 12, "closed_at": "1457068534", "comments": 38, "commits": 31, "created_at": "1456660694", "deletions": 201, "labels": ["alca-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "pdmv-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "659ec73701429f4d32d80232b15c59035e9c2417", "merged_at": "1457068534", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 13516, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 4, "state": "closed", "title": "relval matrix updates", "updated_at": "1457068534", "user": "hengne"}

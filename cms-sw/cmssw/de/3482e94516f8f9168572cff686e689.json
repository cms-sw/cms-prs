Reading from a file is only used locally from time to time to produce a payload.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe produced bad component payload, with the FED errors source included from a file, is identical to the one produced with a 10_1_X release, and that is added as a new unit test. This tests uses a DQM file from EOS, I added a check to skip the tests in case that is not found, is that a reasonable solution? Matrix tests run without errors, no changes in the comparisons are expected.\r\n\r\nCC: @kmondal @mmusich @robervalwalsh ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 56, "closed_at": "1624946048", "comments": 28, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1623323028", "deletions": 418, "labels": ["alca-approved", "bug-fix", "code-checks-approved", "db-approved", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "194eb7b71965e04bd70d20a4ee1a34eaad4f85a7", "merged_at": "1624946048", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "number": 34082, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix SiStripQuality merging with FED errors from a DQM file", "updated_at": "1624946048", "user": "pieterdavid"}

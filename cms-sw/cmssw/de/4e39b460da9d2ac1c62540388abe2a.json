I will write a JIRA ticket against ROOT6 for this issue.  Now that header parsing is no longer used by TypeWithDict, this causes several unit test failures and one add-on test failure.\nThis pull request works around the problem by using the fact that std::vector<<T>>::value_type is just T.  This fixes the broken tests.\nPlease merge this request as soon as convenient.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_ROOT6_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1420270503", "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1420264582", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "core-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "dd23001415e9503c05b3b179060c931db2500428", "merged_at": "1420270503", "merged_by": "davidlt", "number": 7038, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Workaround for ROOT6 bug", "updated_at": "1420475614", "user": "wmtan"}

This will be needed when HLT goes to unscheduled/multithreaded, when producers are no longer in paths (and it works with current menus).\n\nIn addition some cleanup and small fixes to axis labels of some plots.\n\nThe histogram contents should stay the same, as should the set of histograms except DQMGenericClient adds new \"globalEfficiencies\" histogram in each subfolder it produces efficiency plots to.\n\nFYI: @mbluj\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "changed_files": 13, "closed_at": "1400073392", "comments": 7, "commits": 8, "created_at": "1399887119", "deletions": 537, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "26886aef111280d71cfcdf4f2f87acffcfb40ae8", "merged_at": "1400073392", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_1_0_pre8", "number": 3820, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Migrate Tau HLT DQM to DQMGenericClient+DQMEDHarvester", "updated_at": "1476951466", "user": "makortel"}

This \"works\" on a technical level only by accident but does not specify any sort of physically sensible list of bad components. This PR updates the pixel bad component record to use a payload that models an ideal detector with no bad components. In addition, several obsolete pixel tags have been removed. Please refer to the [presentation at the 13 August 2020 AlCaDB meeting ](https://indico.cern.ch/event/950215/#31-issue-with-pixel-bad-compon) for further details.\r\n\r\nNote: the previous GT (110X_mcRun4_realistic_v3) differed from what was ran in the MC samples.

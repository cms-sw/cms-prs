It was tested with actual data collected in December in DESY, and presented at the tracker simulation upgrade meeting on June 17: https://indico.cern.ch/event/305424/session/3/contribution/4/material/slides/0.pdf\n\nWhile it touches several packages, there is basically no modification of existing code. These are new classes designed to live without interfering with the existing code. Additions are for the unpacker itself (in EventFilter), for the digi data format (in DataFormat) and for the cabling (CondFormat and related).\n", "branch": "CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "changed_files": 53, "closed_at": "1405412268", "comments": 7, "commits": 24, "created_at": "1405073883", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["alca-pending", "comparison-pending", "db-pending", "new-package-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "b18de8b6f0aac970af3d50646c3e4f16321ff65f", "merged_at": "1405412268", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "number": 4616, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Unpacker for phase-2 outer tracker", "updated_at": "1405412268", "user": "delaere"}

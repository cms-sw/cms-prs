This is based on the agreed plan between the PF group and HGCAL DPG that we will make this switch when #32291 is integrated (which happened a couple of days ago). The simPFProducer is still run for now, but not injected to the PF candidate list.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI ran this PR with the default setting (pfTICL) and also with `--customise RecoParticleFlow/Configuration/RecoParticleFlow_cff.replaceTICLwithSimPF`, and compared PF candidate outputs (actually packedCandidates) with those without this PR with the default (SimPF) and pfTICL injected. The test was done with 23234.0_TTbar 2026D49 without PU. I confirmed identical results when pfTICL or simPF is used for both without and with this PR.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nThis is not a backport.\r\n\r\n@bendavid @rovere @felicepantaleo @jnsandhya @zeratul87", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1612958212", "comments": 43, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1611898285", "deletions": 49, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "8377aeacb6303d1996b0fd6282fad8ccba6433ee", "merged_at": "1612958212", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 32766, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "Change the default phase 2 PF reconstruction for endcap from simPF to pfTICL", "updated_at": "1613025574", "user": "hatakeyamak"}

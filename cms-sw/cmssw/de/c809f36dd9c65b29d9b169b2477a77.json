There are no changes to the output.  This PR does not depend on any other PRs, but it does rely on the external UTM library 0.10, which is already included in the CMSSW_12_3_0_pre3 release and the CMSSW_12_3_X master.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with a description of the feature proposed or problem addressed, specifying:\r\n  - what changes are expected in the output if any, \r\n  - what other PRs or externals it depends upon if any,\r\n  - link to any additional material useful to provide a documentation for this PR (slides, JIRA tickets, related pull requestes, hypernews, TWiki or Indico pages)  -->\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis PR was validated in the following ways:\r\n(1) all code changes were verified to successfully compile with the CMSSW_12_3_X master\r\n(2) all code changes successfully passed \"scram build code-format\" checks\r\n(2) test vectors were produced (with the code changes to the emulator) and compared with the uGT firmware.  Perfect agreement was observed between the emulator and the firmware.\r\n(3) the runTheMatrix workflow successfully passed all tests.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with a description of which tests have been performed to verify the correctness of the PR, including the eventual addition of new code for testing like unit tests, test configurations, additions or updates to the runTheMatrix test workflows -->\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nThis PR is not a backport.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with any link to  -->\r\n\r\nBefore submitting your pull requests, make sure you followed this checklist:\r\n- verify that the PR is really intended for the chosen branch\r\n- verify that changes follow [CMS Naming, Coding, And Style Rules](http://cms-sw.github.io/cms_coding_rules.html)\r\n- verify that the PR passes the basic test procedure suggested in the [CMSSW PR instructions](https://cms-sw.github.io/PRWorkflow.html)\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 18, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1643753667", "deletions": 10, "labels": ["l1-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 36858, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "open", "title": "implements LLP displaced jet trigger in uGT emulator for CMSSW 12 3 x", "updated_at": "1644416176", "user": "cavana"}

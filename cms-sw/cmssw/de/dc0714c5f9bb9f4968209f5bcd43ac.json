While this may be somehow expected in this early stage of commissioning / construction it's worthwhile having in release some monitoring for when this happens.\r\nIn addition the HGCAL unpacker was already filling a series of \"quality flags\" which were not propagated elsewhere and could not be monitored. \r\nIn this PR we introduce a new SoA `DataFormats/HGCalDigi/interface/HGCalFEDPacketInfoSoA.h` which is filled with basic flags that indicate whether the data is normal or as errors. The SoA is expected to be furthermore useful in developing a fast error DQM for HGCAL system validation setups\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis PR has been validated with real data acquired with a six module stand. Should not have any impact on the CMSSW simulation or data workflows for the time being.\r\n\r\n@IzaakWN @yulunmiao @hqucms ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 16, "comments": 17, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1740492302", "deletions": 55, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-approved", "heterogeneous-pending", "hgcal-dpg-pending", "changes-dataformats"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 47451, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 12, "state": "open", "title": "Monitor quality of unpacked FED data with a dedicated SoA", "updated_at": "1740736093", "user": "pfs"}

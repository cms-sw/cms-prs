The cause for this is that while the denominator is filled once per event, the numerator is filled for each mismatching algorithm bit.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the logic such that the numerator is filled only once per event. Arguably it would be nicer to instead fill the denominator with all valid algo bits, however to my knowledge it's not trivial to retrieve the number of algorithms used by a given menu from the DQM.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nNone yet.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1699972989", "comments": 16, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1697024233", "deletions": 28, "labels": ["dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "bae2d80c2fd1da50a0768b1de478950d81c77e5a", "merged_at": "1699972989", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "number": 42990, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix ratio plot for uGT data-emulator mismatches", "updated_at": "1699972989", "user": "dinyar"}

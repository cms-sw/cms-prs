Everything important is there.\n\nEverything is rebased to -pre5 now.\n\n@dmitrijus For you this PR adds more DQM plugins and therefore more histograms. Apart from that not much has changed. (I did fix some of the whitespace issues.)\n\n@slava77 @davidlange6 TrackerTopology now has a new interface as discussed in #14230 .\nI only implemented it for Pixel, but it would obviously work as well for the rest of the Tracker. But I am a bit reluctant to add that now, since a typo there would be likely, almost impossible to spot and could bite really badly if someone started to use it.\n\nThere are now 8 new packages. One with shared code, one with shared config and 6 plugins.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 46, "closed_at": "1464072047", "comments": 21, "commits": 125, "created_at": "1463736461", "deletions": 61, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "3852bdf90439d2d08bdf9e93bba94e0dc99998ee", "merged_at": "1464072047", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 14586, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 5, "state": "closed", "title": "Phase 1 Pixel DQM (number 4, the story continues)", "updated_at": "1464953469", "user": "schneiml"}

Validation results are available [here](http://cmantill.web.cern.ch/cmantill/phase2/PU200_100ev/plots/plots_highPurity/effandfakePtEtaPhi.pdf), showing substantially  consistency with the `CMSSW_11_0_0_pre13` results.\r\nFurther technical validation has been run locally with this branch by using:\r\n```\r\nrunTheMatrix.py --what upgrade -l 20007.0,20407.0,20807.0,21607.0,22007.0,22807.0,22834.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nThis PR is not a backport.\r\ncc:\r\n@tsusa @tvami @mtosi @JanFSchulte @jalimena @emiglior @skinnari\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1584346495", "comments": 32, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1583858593", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["alca-pending", "bug-fix", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "orp-approved", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "1eb2f87c3784d8c8ad3cb993896a913ba0e0fd9b", "merged_at": "1584346495", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 29168, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Update phase-2 Inner Tracker Templates and GenError conditions", "updated_at": "1584346495", "user": "mmusich"}

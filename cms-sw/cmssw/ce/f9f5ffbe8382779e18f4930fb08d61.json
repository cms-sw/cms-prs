The failing unit test was fixed via https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/45954, but the possibility to generate a segmentation fault when not filling the map remains. This is fixed in this PR. \r\nTo demonstrate the viability I add a section to the `catch2` unit tests for this use case.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n`scram b runtests` runs fine.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

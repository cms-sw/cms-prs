Updated HCAL scintillator radiation damage parameters based on latest measurements and fits (https://indico.cern.ch/event/721565/contributions/2966213/attachments/1632432/2603148/2018.04.12_Updated_DvsR_fits_and_predictions.pdf)\r\n2. Updated HCAL SiPM radiation damage parameters based on latest measurements and fits (https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/pub/CMSPublic/HcalDPGResultsCMSDPS2017042/dark_current_vs_lumi.png)\r\n3. Simplified HCAL PF threshold adjustments for different eras.\r\n4. Use Run 3 PF thresholds for Phase 2 by default (account for increased depth segmentation in HB).\r\n5. Add separate CaloTower thresholds for Run 3 HB depths 1,2 (similar to Phase 1 HE, updated a while back).\r\n6. Update PF and CaloTower thresholds for different HCAL aging scenarios, now that SiPM noise can increase beyond the previous default threshold of ~0.8 GeV.\r\n\r\nThe new thresholds were proposed, tested, and validated by @hatakeyamak (thanks!): https://baylor.app.box.com/s/w32ja75krcbxcycyifexu28dwlgrj7wg\r\n\r\nWe observed that PF gammas get a lot of extra energy introduced by ECAL aging; this will be followed up with the appropriate people.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 13, "comments": 16, "commits": 13, "created_at": "1529605771", "deletions": 349, "labels": ["alca-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "hlt-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "tests-started", "upgrade-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 23638, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Update HCAL aging parameters and thresholds", "updated_at": "1529630538", "user": "kpedro88"}

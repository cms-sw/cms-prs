Run-3 will use new CLCT patterns which, in combination with the CCLUT algorithm, allow for a more precise determination of LCT position and bending in the CSC local trigger. More information on the CCLUT algorithm and CSC trigger data formats can be found here: https://gitlab.cern.ch/tdr/notes/DN-20-016/blob/master/temp/DN-20-016_temp.pdf. The CCLUT algorithm uses a new `CSCComparatorCodeLUT` object that loads the LUTs in txt format. I do not yet have an actual position offset/slope LUT generator, but plan to add that in a follow-up PR.\r\n\r\nThe PR is the fifth in a series following https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/29233, https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/29205, https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/28846 and https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/28600. A related PR is this one https://github.com/cms-data/L1Trigger-CSCTriggerPrimitives/pull/1 where the LUTs are introduced for position offset and slope. \r\n\r\nTo be clear: the code is not enabled yet - and won't be for quite some time as it requires precise coordination between EMTF, OMTF, DQM, packer/unpacker etc. There should be no differences in any of the workflows (and I didn't see any in local tests).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested with WF 27434.0\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n@tahuang1991 ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 10, "closed_at": "1594142510", "comments": 60, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1591232207", "deletions": 27, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "requires-external", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "82755cab297d85f9790f567b1846597d7472aec1", "merged_at": "1594142509", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 30103, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "CLCT comparator code calculation (CCLUT-5)", "updated_at": "1594142510", "user": "dildick"}

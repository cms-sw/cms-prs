With the 24 instances in the standard sequence this amounts to more than 70 Mb at 200 pileup.\nHere is the retained memory, excluding produced collection sizes, summed over all instances of the class at 200 pileup:\n![fastjet_before](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6480160/7749331/9f302cae-ffc4-11e4-8707-1f0e68eaaf3c.png)\n\nHere is the same thing after applying this pull request:\n![fastjet_after](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6480160/7749346/bc0104c0-ffc4-11e4-8e70-d5af24658b99.png)\n\nSwapping out the work vectors with empty vectors saves about 10 Mb of that 70.  The remainder is from deleting the `fjClusterSeq_` object in between events (it's created new each event anyway).\n\n@lgray \n", "branch": "CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1432282053", "comments": 17, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1432207460", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "f0571e649d7caac79cc518fff3c09c0402d7f54c", "merged_at": "1432282053", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "number": 9203, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Trim FastjetJetProducer memory", "updated_at": "1432286822", "user": "mark-grimes"}

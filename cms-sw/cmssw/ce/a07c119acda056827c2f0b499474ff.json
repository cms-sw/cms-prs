This customization drastically improves the tracking efficiency and fake rate at pt's less than 2 GeV, and will significantly enhance physics capabilities in HI events at low pt.\n\nThe customization can be checked running a config generated with the command below over RAW data from the 2015 PbPb run.  Note that with this customization the previously used HIGeneralTracks collection is dropped and replaced with a MergedCollection in the final event content.\n\ncmsDriver.py step2 --process RECO --repacked --conditions 75X_dataRun2_PromptHI_v3 --scenario HeavyIons -s RAW2DIGI,L1Reco,RECO --datatier AOD --customise Configuration/DataProcessing/RecoTLR.customiseRun2CommonHI,RecoHI/Configuration/RecoMergedTrackCollection.customiseAddMergedTrackCollection --data --eventcontent AOD --no_exec\n\nMore information regarding the changes in performance can be found in the presentation shown in the HI PAG meeting here:\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/507212/contributions/2189474/attachments/1284769/1910223/Pixel_Status_HIN_WEST.pdf\n\n@CesarBernardes\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1467126751", "comments": 24, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1465388058", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "7500dd9382d114704335cf58dea7a01620af1517", "merged_at": "1467126751", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 14819, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Customization for merging General and Pixel Track Collections in PbPb Reconstruction", "updated_at": "1467126752", "user": "abaty"}

It seems easier to understand this code if the part of it dealing with the SiteLocalConfigService is all in the InputFileCatalog class and not split between the InputFileCatalog and FileLocator classes.\r\n\r\nAlso get rid of the init functions and just move their content directly into the constructors (A few functions were moved because of this but otherwise unmodified).\r\n\r\nThis should give the same behavior as before. No changes expected.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nWe had good unit tests for this and I updated the FileLocator one to still work with the changes. They still pass. Compiles after ```checkdeps -a``` also.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1763677036", "deletions": 118, "labels": ["core-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_0_X", "number": 49430, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 9, "state": "open", "title": "Cleanup in InputFileCatalog", "updated_at": "1764021834", "user": "wddgit"}

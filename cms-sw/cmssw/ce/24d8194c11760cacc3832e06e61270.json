For this the `operator==` was overloaded for the objects that can be compared.\r\n\r\nObjects that are handled so far are GlobalAlgBlk, l1t::Muon, l1t::RegionalMuonCand but additional objects can be added.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 18, "comments": 28, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1516362322", "deletions": 34, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_0_X", "number": 21897, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "L1T object comparison producer", "updated_at": "1516458335", "user": "thomreis"}

However, with DD4hep, these volumes were composed of `Bpix_Pipe_Steel`. One way this difference appeared was that the `Bpix_Pipe_Steel_Half` material cut couple was missing with DD4hep.\r\n\r\nLooking in the code, one can see that the `tubeMatHalf` variable, which sets the material for these volumes, is set to `CoolTubeMaterialHalf` in the old DD code, while it was set to `CoolTubeMaterial` in the DD4hep code, which looks like a simple typo.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nWith this fix, with DD4hep the `PixelBarrelLayerNCoolTubeHalf` volumes are now properly composed of `Bpix_Pipe_Steel_Half`, and the corresponding material cut couple also appears, just as in the old DD.\r\nThese two configs were used for validation:\r\n```\r\nSimG4Core/PrintGeomInfo/test/python/g4OverlapCheck_cfg.py\r\nSimG4Core/PrintGeomInfo/test/python/g4OverlapCheckDD4Hep_cfg.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nNo backport is needed.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1614643625", "comments": 15, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1614367136", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["bug-fix", "code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-rejected"], "merge_commit_sha": "8c3021dcf709478fbb138988ed846d2fbf13049f", "merged_at": "1614643625", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 33009, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "[DD4hep] Correct name of material for PixelBarrelLayerNCoolTubeHalf volumes", "updated_at": "1614643625", "user": "cvuosalo"}

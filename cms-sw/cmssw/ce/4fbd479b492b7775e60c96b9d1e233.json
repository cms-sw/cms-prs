This will be fixed in a future PR. \n\nThe full matrix was run and showed only 3 failing workflows with errors unrelated to the conditions.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "changed_files": 9085, "closed_at": "1401978000", "comments": 18, "commits": 4812, "created_at": "1400927814", "deletions": 1426911, "labels": ["alca-pending", "analysis-pending", "comparison-pending", "db-pending", "l1-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_7_1_0_pre9", "number": 4003, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "move to use new conditions DB (71X)", "updated_at": "1404128287", "user": "apfeiffer1"}

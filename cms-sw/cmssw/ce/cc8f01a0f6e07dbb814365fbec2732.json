This has no effect on the end results because `newalpha` is never used when `nalphabits` is zero.\r\n\r\nFixes #46403\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI was able to reproduce the runtime error reported in #46403 within the 23634.0 workflow, and after adding this short circuit, the same workflow gives no error.\r\n\r\n@tomalin ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1730119668", "comments": 12, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1729603907", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["l1-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "05a8dcf56461a946fa021e9ce14e4049d2995d43", "merged_at": "1730119668", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_14_2_X", "number": 46481, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix for nalphabits == 0", "updated_at": "1730119669", "user": "aehart"}

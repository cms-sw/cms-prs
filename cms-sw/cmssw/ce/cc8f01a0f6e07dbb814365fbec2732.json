This has no effect on the end results because `newalpha` is never used when `nalphabits` is zero.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI was able to reproduce the runtime error reported in #46403 within the 23634.0 workflow, and after adding this short circuit, the same workflow gives no error.\r\n\r\n@tomalin ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 6, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1729603907", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["l1-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_2_X", "number": 46481, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Fix for nalphabits == 0", "updated_at": "1729605019", "user": "aehart"}

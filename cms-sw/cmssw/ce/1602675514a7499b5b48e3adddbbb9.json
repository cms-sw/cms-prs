However, the Python interpreter would still block because of the GIL. This correction releases the GIL so that CMSSW can run while Python is running.\r\n\r\nTested on a simple example: observed concurrent execution and no segmentation faults.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1494480189", "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1494442355", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["comparison-available", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "6aec2bef1c5b79c6f2c78f6daa60a1876886f29b", "merged_at": "1494480189", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_2_X", "number": 18683, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Release the Python GIL when running PythonEventProcessor.", "updated_at": "1494480189", "user": "jpivarski"}

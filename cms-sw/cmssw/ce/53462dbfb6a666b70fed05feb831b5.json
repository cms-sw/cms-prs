Make it\r\nreally plot seconds. Also add new command line arguments to\r\nexplicitly set the x axis limits in the stall grapher.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nNothing runs this Python script in the release or unit/RelVal tests. The\r\nchange has no effect other than on the plots in the PDF file produced\r\nby the stall grapher.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1572551348", "comments": 22, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1571339369", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "5f780abd235b086affb146a1a4c0afa5b638f549", "merged_at": "1572551348", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 28206, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix stall grapher x axis label.", "updated_at": "1572551349", "user": "wddgit"}

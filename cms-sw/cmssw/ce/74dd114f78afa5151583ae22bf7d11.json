It does not change the logic of the code nor anything in the PCL workflow configuration and the matrix test. The main purpose is reformatting the code, updating the README files and adding one more parameter to `PPSAlignmentHarvester` - reasonability range - which ensures that the harvester will not produce NaN or extremely big alignment corrections in the output.\r\n\r\nApart from the CMSSW changes, a [new TWiki page](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/CMS/PPSAlign) was created, and some part of the documentation that previously had been in the README files was moved there.\r\n\r\nFor further information about including global alignment in CMSSW check out two previous PRs: #35631 and #35874.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with a description of the feature proposed or problem addressed, specifying:\r\n  - what changes are expected in the output if any, \r\n  - what other PRs or externals it depends upon if any,\r\n  - link to any additional material useful to provide a documentation for this PR (slides, JIRA tickets, related pull requestes, hypernews, TWiki or Indico pages)  -->\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n- The `1042` relval runs correctly. \r\n- The test from *CalibPPS/AlignmentGloba/test* reproduced the results. \r\n- Another tests based on Run 2 data also reproduced results.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 20, "closed_at": "1638921841", "comments": 27, "commits": 11, "created_at": "1637934635", "deletions": 1306, "labels": ["alca-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "db-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "25cfff6d5f04a9757ac56244139e0e68124b1d05", "merged_at": "1638921841", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 36257, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 19, "state": "closed", "title": "PPS global alignment - reformat", "updated_at": "1638921842", "user": "MatiXOfficial"}

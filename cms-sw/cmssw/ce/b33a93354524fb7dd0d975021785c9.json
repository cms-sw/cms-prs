Previously they both used the same customisation and so HGCal (142xx) failed in step 2 because it couldn't find the ME0 hits.  With this pull request the customisations are diverged.\n\nThe effective only change is that HGCal calls cust_2023Pixel() before applying the HGCal specifics.  It previously called cust_2023Muon() instead.  HGCalMuon and HGCalMuon4Eta still call cust_2023Muon().\n\nThe consequence is that HGCal no longer has these two lines in the customisation sequence:\n\n```\nprocess=customise_rpc(process)\nprocess=customise_me0(process)\n```\n\n**@ianna, is it correct to remove the customise_rpc call as well?**  I did it this way because it was easier to delegate to the cust_2023Pixel function.\n\nAfter this change the 142xx tests run through step 2 and fail in step 3 with the same crash as all the others.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1400794675", "comments": 4, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1400761358", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "72cdd08c9214a29eb65ea5849f22b0ebf879714b", "merged_at": "1400794675", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "number": 3964, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Remove ME0 from HGCal custom (but not HGCalMuon)", "updated_at": "1438587401", "user": "mark-grimes"}

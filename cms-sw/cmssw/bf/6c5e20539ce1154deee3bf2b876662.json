The refresh logic, previously based on an \"artificial\" upper limit of the IOV from the Condition DB, has been changed and it is now entirely based on Framework features.   The refreshTime parameter is still required and set the maximum number of lumisections of duration for the validity of an open IOV, before to force a new query. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nIntegration tests.

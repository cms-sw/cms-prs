With this PR, the esConsumes migration of this package should be complete. Note that we have not addressed the issue of EDAnalyzers needing to be `one` module. That will be a separate PR. This PR only addressees esConsumes migration.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nValidated by local tests, performed by running the following config files: \r\n`CalibMuon/DTCalibration/python/dtT0AbsoluteReferenceCorrection_cfg.py` , \r\n`CalibMuon/DTCalibration/python/dtT0FillChamberFromDBCorrection_cfg.py`,\r\n`CalibMuon/DTCalibration/python/dtT0FillDefaultFromDBCorrection_cfg.py`,\r\n`CalibMuon/DTCalibration/python/dtTTrigConstantShiftCorrection_cfg.py`,\r\n`CalibMuon/DTCalibration/python/dtTTrigCorrection_cfi.py`\r\n\r\n`runTheMatrix.py -l 12434.0` also ran fine.\r\n\r\nThis PR is not a backport.\r\nBackport not needed.\r\n\r\n[With thanks to Carlo Battilana]\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 59, "closed_at": "1634556705", "comments": 18, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1634307550", "deletions": 149, "labels": ["alca-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "bd6896f49433a01a19cc13be3ccc741980eb1243", "merged_at": "1634556705", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "number": 35695, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 30, "state": "closed", "title": "esConsumes migration of DT calibration codes", "updated_at": "1634556706", "user": "swagata87"}

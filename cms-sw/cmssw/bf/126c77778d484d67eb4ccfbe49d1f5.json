More detailed comments will be added as part of the review.\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n```bash\r\n./getHLT.sh --dbproxy # will now work\r\n./getFrozenHLT.sh --dbproxy # will now work\r\n./makeSubtables --dbproxy # will now work\r\n./runAll.csh [..] # does not query ConfDB anymore (content of the tests is unchanged)\r\n\r\nhltIntegrationTests hlt.py [..] # will now work\r\nhltListPaths hlt.py [..] # will now work\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe aim is to add functionalities, and leave current behaviour unchanged (except for tweaks to the printouts of `hltIntegrationTests`).\r\n\r\nMerely technical. No differences expected in the outputs of PR tests (this PR is basically insensitive to PR tests).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nPrivate tests.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported, please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\n`CMSSW_12_4_X`\r\n`CMSSW_12_5_X`\r\n\r\n(Backports are not necessary, but they could be useful to keep these tools aligned across release cycles.)\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 13, "comments": 11, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1667827816", "deletions": 635, "labels": ["hlt-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_6_X", "number": 40004, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 18, "state": "open", "title": "various improvements to HLT-development tools", "updated_at": "1668550397", "user": "missirol"}

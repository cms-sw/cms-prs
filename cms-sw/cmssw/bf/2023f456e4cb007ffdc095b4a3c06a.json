The gun with tau decays by tauola is remained, the gun with tau decays by pythia8 is added. The corresponding configurations with HepMC3 interface and with a SIM step are added.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n Validated using the added test configurations", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1765373338", "deletions": 15, "labels": ["generators-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-rejected"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_0_X", "number": 49592, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Add pythia8 EGun producing HepMC3 event record", "updated_at": "1765373455", "user": "mkirsano"}

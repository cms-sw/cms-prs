This pull request enables the use of an me0.xml file introduced earlier by Sunanda in which the ME0 detector is split in 10 eta partitions (#14537).  Further on some fixes were made to have the entire simulation chain working up to Reco&Validation. We would like to stress that for the muon upgrade simulations this PR his highly desired to enter into the 810 release.\n\nThis is an official milestone for the Muon Upgrade TDR, documented here:\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/483089/contributions/1992104/attachments/1214511/1773241/Muon_Milestones_UpgradeStudies.pdf\ndetails given in the muon phase II simulation meeting here:\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/574385/contributions/2323764/attachments/1352593/2042703/20161011_PhaseIISim_ME0Status_Complete.pdf\n\nThis is the continuation of PR #16114 that I closed by accident and was not able to reopen again. This PR is based on IB CMSSW_8_1_X_2016-10-11-2300 and resolves the conflict on the 2023D5 geometry. Hope I got out of the git marshes now and the continuation will be more smooth.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 42, "closed_at": "1477913285", "comments": 157, "commits": 37, "created_at": "1476259483", "deletions": 129, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "geometry-approved", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "cd09d5b63b6f24be2d4267c8a8271e908c4b6802", "merged_at": "1477913285", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 16185, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 44, "state": "closed", "title": "Realistic ME0Geometry with 10 Eta Partitions", "updated_at": "1477913285", "user": "pietverwilligen"}

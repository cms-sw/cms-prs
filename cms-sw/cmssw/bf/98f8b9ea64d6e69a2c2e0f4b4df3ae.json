According to @bendavid adding such info to the nano has been discussed briefly in the physics tools workshop planning.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI checked that the info gets added properly to a test MC sample. I just took the precision position from the reco vertex. For t0, I don't know what the needed precision would be.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": "1605457815", "comments": 65, "commits": 14, "created_at": "1604346065", "deletions": 14, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved", "xpog-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "49a8fd14cc09c58fbcf8ed889fc270cf6602b61b", "merged_at": "1605457815", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 32008, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "Add Gen vertex time and position to NanoAOD", "updated_at": "1605469110", "user": "kdlong"}

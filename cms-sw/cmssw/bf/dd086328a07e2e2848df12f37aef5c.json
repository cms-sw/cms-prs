Documented in detail in [twiki](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/SWGuideL1TOfflineDev#Status_of_Integration), most notably:\r\n   - BMTF: improved eta assignment leading to 50% better resolution w.r.t. GEN\r\n   - New uGMT extrapolation LUTs 20170505. These take the BMTF eta scale fix into account. This needs the external Muons data. (https://github.com/cms-data/L1Trigger-L1TMuon/pull/10)\r\n   - EG - new extended H/E, plus 2nd isolation WP (aka 2016)\r\n   - MET Emulator bug fix when getting address using ieta for MET PUS LUT. Emulator was counting from 0, firmware was counting from 1. \r\n   - Introduce a new caloParams2017_v1_7 to reflect current online conditions.\r\n(https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/SWGuideL1TOfflineDev#Status_of_Integration)\r\n - Number of files changed 58\r\n    - 37 source code files \r\n    - 21 configuration python files, most not used by default, useful to developers \r\n\r\n\r\nNote:  there will be additional fixes in BMTF not provided yet, but that will come in a separate small PR.\r\nShould review this one first.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 58, "closed_at": "1496841588", "comments": 18, "commits": 58, "created_at": "1496418580", "deletions": 2243, "labels": ["comparison-notrun", "l1-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "requires-external", "tests-rejected"], "milestone": "CMSSW_9_2_X", "number": 19084, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Pr92x L1T development upto l1t integration v95.2 ", "updated_at": "1496841589", "user": "rekovic"}

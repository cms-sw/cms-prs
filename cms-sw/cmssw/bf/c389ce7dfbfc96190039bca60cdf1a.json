This allows ROOT to use implicit multi-threading to decompress multiple TBranches concurrently.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis was tested against an actual low efficiency AOD to MiniAOD production job. CPU and number of IO operation measurements show this change to be a substantial improvement over the original implementation of `delayReadingEventProducts == False`.\r\n\r\nresolves https://github.com/cms-sw/framework-team/issues/1380\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 29, "comments": 7, "commits": 13, "created_at": "1747309580", "deletions": 520, "labels": ["core-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 48088, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 12, "state": "open", "title": "Allow use of TTree::GetEntry in PoolSource", "updated_at": "1747414229", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

This allows the GlobalBoard to produce the correct decision for triggers with fractional prescales, whereas before a fractional prescale would never result in L1A. This update is needed in the context of the L1 menu preparation for Run 3, in order to correctly project the rates for triggers which use fractional prescales.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nBasic tests performed successfully starting from CMSSW_12_6_0_pre2.\r\nFrom CMSSW_12_6_0_pre2/src:\r\n\r\ngit cms-checkdeps -a -A\r\nscram b -j 8\r\nscram b runtests\r\nscram build code-checks\r\nscram build code-format\r\nrunTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 30, "commits": 9, "created_at": "1663723296", "deletions": 40, "labels": ["l1-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_6_X", "number": 39464, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 36, "state": "open", "title": "Update GlobalBoard class FDL for fractional prescales, to match logic in firmware", "updated_at": "1664362942", "user": "mitaylor"}

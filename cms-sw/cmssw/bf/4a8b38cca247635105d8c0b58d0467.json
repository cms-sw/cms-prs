The code now also makes it possible to perform such association using PATified fat jets and subjets. To fully exploit this last feature it was necessary to update the PATJetUpdater so that PAT jets are cloned (not constructed from a reference) in order to preserve the reference to the original object the PAT jet was derived from (this is necessary for re-establishing references between updated PAT fat jets and subjets). Finally, minor changes were added to jetTools.py to properly configure the updated SV TagInfo producer.\n\nThis is purely an analysis level update. There should be no impact on the standard reconstruction or MiniAOD production.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1470738983", "comments": 15, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1469911473", "deletions": 60, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "8b77dcd95151c1f468bed04e8e9ba128f9c4cdc2", "merged_at": "1470738983", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 15331, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 6, "state": "closed", "title": "Subjet TagInfo updates", "updated_at": "1470768169", "user": "ferencek"}

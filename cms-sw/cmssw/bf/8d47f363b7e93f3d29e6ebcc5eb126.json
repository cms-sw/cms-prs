The parsing and function evaluation are\ndone using stateless classes so are thread safe and extremely thread\nefficient. The formula parser is shared by all reco::FormulaEvaluators\nto save memory and since the parser is stateless it can efficiently\nbe called by multiple threads simultaneously.\n\nThis is a back port from CMSSW_7_6 of #11516\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 16, "closed_at": "1444449941", "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1443531187", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "9f41c03a9fbc5346fed276f36f385afc46c95899", "merged_at": "1444449941", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 11554, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Added a formula evaluator to replace TFormula calls", "updated_at": "1449600918", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

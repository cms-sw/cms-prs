This will cause a few problems, so this is not ready for merging yet; but it should serve as a proposal for what pre13 could look like. @makortel , @veszpv , @ianna and maybe others might be interested.\n- all `/pixfwd/` folders are removed, their content replacing the respective non-pixfwd files.\n- A conflict appeared at trackerRecoMaterial.xml; 8a4e78a0bf26f42a55250db1b043ff6f50cebce3 was added after @veszpv forked off the pixfwd version. I attempted a merge (not validated).\n- old `PhaseI/pixfwd_*.xml` files removed. This will break `_cfg.py` that use them.\n- 2017 and 2017NewFPix config files updated to load the FPIX xmls from their new places. They are now almost identical.\n- A conflict appeared at cmsExtendedGeometry2017XML_cfi.py; 2e9f311c changed names after the NewFPix version was forked off. Merged in the new 2017XML_cfi.py; old version in 2017NewFPix.\n- 2017NewFPix should be deleted soon.\n- Definitly broken cfg files (should be updated if useful, deleted if no longer needed):\n\n```\nGeometry/CMSCommonData/python/Phase1_R34F16_cmsSimIdealGeometryXML_cfi.py\nGeometry/CMSCommonData/python/cmsExtendedGeometry2017devXML_cfi.py\nGeometry/CMSCommonData/python/cmsExtendedGeometry2019XML_cfi.py\nGeometry/CMSCommonData/python/cmsExtendedGeometryPhaseIPixelXML_cfi.py\n```\n\nChanges validated using MaterialBudget tools to make sure everything is now identical to the old NewFPix geometry. This does **not** check whether the merges are fine.\n\nFurther thoughts: This PR will cause a mess for merging the (hopefully coming soon) FPIX material budget improvements. Maybe we want to keep the `/pixfwd/` copy around for a while to validate these changes?\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 50, "closed_at": "1475906592", "comments": 32, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1474897511", "deletions": 5991, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-pending", "geometry-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 15986, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "Remove old FPIX; make New FPIX default (RFC)", "updated_at": "1475906592", "user": "schneiml"}

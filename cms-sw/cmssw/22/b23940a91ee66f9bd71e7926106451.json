An example is here:\r\nhttps://github.com/cms-jet/JRDatabase/blob/master/textFiles/Autumn18_V7b_MC/Autumn18_V7b_MC_SF_AK4PFchs.txt\r\nhttps://github.com/cms-jet/JRDatabase/blob/master/SQLiteFiles/Autumn18_V7b_MC.db\r\nThis PR provides an interface to access these uncertainties via:\r\nfloat getScaleFactor(const JetParameters& parameters, Variation variation = Variation::NOMINAL, std::string uncertaintySource = \"\") const;\r\nThe condition dataformat is modified, however, the persitent part is untoched, so this code also works on old conditions.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nIt was checked that all uncertainty sources can be accessed with the new interface with the test file runJERsmearingOnMiniAOD.py.\r\nIt was checked that the total uncertainty can be accessed as before in old conditions.\r\n\r\nLinks to discussion in JetMET:\r\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/864045/#2-updates-on-2018-jer-and-disc\r\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/859946/#5-update-on-jer-scale-factors\r\n\r\n#### Backports:\r\n\r\nBackports to all Analysis/NanoAOD releases would be needed, i.e. 10_2_X and 10_6_X.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1576010555", "comments": 24, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1574780222", "deletions": 9, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "db-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "e7593c0983bbe316a68ab27ff3906927622e06e1", "merged_at": "1576010555", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 28480, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 8, "state": "closed", "title": "Jet energy resolution smearing with systematic uncertainties split up", "updated_at": "1576010556", "user": "ahinzmann"}

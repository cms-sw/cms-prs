The `RNTuple` is not planned to support dynamic polymorphism. One such use case in our data formats is `edm::RefToBase<T>` that internally uses dynamic-polymorphism based type erasure. The straightforward migration path is towards [`edm::Ptr<T>`](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/SWGuideEDMRef), but there are also many cases where the use of `edm::RefToBase<T>` could be cleaned up.\r\n\r\nThis PR covers the first case on the list in the issue #42737.\r\nIt contains the set of deprecated `edm::RefToBase` that only dictionary declaration and/or type aliases and/or commented-out code, otherwise unused case. \r\nAll of these can be easily removed without any impact.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nTested in CMSSW_13_3_0_pre3, the basic test passed in the [CMSSW PR instructions](https://cms-sw.github.io/PRWorkflow.html)\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 12, "comments": 0, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1697683664", "deletions": 32, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_3_X", "number": 43055, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Clean up deprecated edm::RefToBase list 1 for RNTuple", "updated_at": "1697683686", "user": "jeongeun"}

Having a `void` function to call only it without checking the return value looks suspicious, especially the function has \"reset\" in its name. This PR assumes that the intention was to call `clear()` instead. According to DXR the `resetPedestals()` is not called from anywhere in CMSSW.\r\n\r\nThis issue was found by GCC 9.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe code compiles without warnings with GCC 9.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1556564155", "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1556298771", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "873d523e9b71c8a1f759ddaddf5e2fc64b640c42", "merged_at": "1556564155", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 26551, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix TT6NTPedestalCalculator::resetPedestals() to actually clear the vector", "updated_at": "1556564155", "user": "makortel"}

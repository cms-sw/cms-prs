Straightforward implementation would have lead to some amount of copy-paste because `pix_*` branches have BPix/FPix hits, `str_*` and `ph2_*` TIB/TID/TOB/TEC hits, and `inv_*` and `simhit_*` hits from all subdetectors, so I went a bit creative.\r\n\r\nThis PR is a successor of #18403 (which attempted to serialize the TrackerTopology constants and do the parsing on the ntuple analysis code).\r\n\r\nI also included a small fix in the ntuple python library by @ebrondol (da8d834)\r\n\r\nTested in 9_1_0_pre2, no changes expected.\r\n\r\n@rovere @VinInn @ebrondol", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1493789305", "comments": 18, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1493275555", "deletions": 269, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "b4b040828807dd0833b7f54fd24ef8919934f70a", "merged_at": "1493789304", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_1_X", "number": 18491, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Generalize DetId parsing in TrackingNtuple", "updated_at": "1493789305", "user": "makortel"}

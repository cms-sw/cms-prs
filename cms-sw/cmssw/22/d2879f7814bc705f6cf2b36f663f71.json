More direct tests should probably be done reproducing the segfault and verifying this fixes it in 13_0_X with the standard g4e propagator and track refit workflow.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 0, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1673911648", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["simulation-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "number": 40543, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "re-initialize geometry in g4e propagator as required to avoid segfaults", "updated_at": "1673911672", "user": "bendavid"}

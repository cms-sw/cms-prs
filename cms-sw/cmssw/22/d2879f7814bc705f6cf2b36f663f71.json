More direct tests should probably be done reproducing the segfault and verifying this fixes it in 13_0_X with the standard g4e propagator and track refit workflow.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1673972646", "comments": 17, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1673911648", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["simulation-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "bug-fix", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "03b24142238ce8590f3819a7f5daa160f8a58fef", "merged_at": "1673972646", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "number": 40543, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "re-initialize geometry in g4e propagator as required to avoid segfaults", "updated_at": "1673979223", "user": "bendavid"}

I plan to make another request in the future that will delete METProducer.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 27, "closed_at": "1386845433", "comments": 9, "commits": 19, "created_at": "1386649403", "deletions": 310, "labels": ["fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "9b1a3b2becf994cacdcdb54b1845d98720aa0af7", "merged_at": "1386845433", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_0_0_pre10", "number": 1745, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "code-cleaning in RecoMET/METProducers", "updated_at": "1389471072", "user": "TaiSakuma"}

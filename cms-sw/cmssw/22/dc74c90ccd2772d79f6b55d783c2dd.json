The simulation of generator protons will be based on the simulated beam spot position in accordance with the simulation workflow in central production. The correspoding tag will be provided by AlCa as given in this AlCaDB PR [#86](https://github.com/cms-AlCaDB/AlCaTools/issues/86).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe changes were validated with the current version of the PPS full simulation and replacing the tag for ```BeamSpotObectsRcd``` by the available preliminary tag for ```SimBeamSpotObectsRcd``` in PrepDB [here](https://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/list/Prep/tags/SimBeamSpot_Run3RoundOptics25ns13TeVHighSigmaZVtxSmearingParameters_v0_mc) via:\r\n\r\n```\r\nprocess.GlobalTag.toGet = cms.VPSet(\r\n  cms.PSet(\r\n           record = cms.string(\"SimBeamSpotObjectsRcd\"),\r\n           tag = cms.string(\"SimBeamSpot_Run3RoundOptics25ns13TeVHighSigmaZVtxSmearingParameters_v0_mc\"),\r\n           connect = cms.string(\"frontier://FrontierPrep/CMS_CONDITIONS\")\r\n          )\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs shown below the vertex z position is correctly simulated by the PPS full simulation.

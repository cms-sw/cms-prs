Please see the details [here](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1327490/contributions/5586686/subcontributions/442720/attachments/2717518/4720407/230920_retraining_Upgrade.pdf) and [here](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1344917/contributions/5765942/attachments/2802563/4890080/HLT_upgrade_workshop%20(1).pdf).\r\nThis PR is associated with the Phase2 DeepJet retraining model integration [PR](https://github.com/cms-data/RecoBTag-Combined/pull/56).\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe model was tested locally in `CMSSW_13_1_0`.\r\nFollow the [Phase 2 HLT simplified menu](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/HighLevelTriggerPhase2SimplifiedMenu) and `edmConfigDump` to get the configuration file and the HLT dump `phase2_hlt.py`, and in `process.hltPfDeepFlavourJetTagsModEta2p4` and\r\n`process.hltPfDeepFlavourJetTags, change the `model_path` to retained model`.\r\nAfter running  `cmsRun phase2_hlt.py`, the same warnings from `InclusiveCandidateVertexFinder` and `EcalRecHitProducer` are observed as running with `RecoBTag/Combined/data/DeepFlavourV01_PhaseII/model.onnx`, which is the default model. \r\nPlease see the details in the [presentation](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1393422/contributions/5856887/attachments/2817963/4920406/HLT_upgrade_report_March10.pdf). \r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

The photon paths in Run2/Run3 use these variables, but we haven't yet explored them for phase2. This PR adds these two variables in the development path, and thus makes it easier to study these variables. Once properly studied and cuts are decided, they can be added in real HLT paths as producer+filter. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nPhase2 HLT runs fine, and the distribution of new variables look reasonable.\r\nLeft plot: r9,  Right plot: track iso (hollow cone)\r\n\r\n <img src=\"https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/assets/5052706/21491786-81b4-4907-b9be-f7ad4d4447c5\" width=\"400\" />\r\n\r\n <img src=\"https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/assets/5052706/86622b8c-9edc-4f15-96a6-b5de4d5a9319\" width=\"400\" />", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "comments": 24, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1710506307", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["hlt-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved", "egamma"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 44423, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Produce r9 and trackIso(hollow cone) in EGamma development path", "updated_at": "1710763266", "user": "swagata87"}

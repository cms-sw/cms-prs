From the descriptions of the two PRs:\r\n\r\n> The purpose of this PR is to:\r\n> \r\n>   * add `HLT_Ele30_WPTight_Gsf` to the OfflineDQM among the monitored paths in `HLT/EGM/TagAndProbeEffs`, as requested by TSG in [CMSHLT-2810](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSHLT-2810);\r\n> \r\n>   * change the offline electron and photon IDs for EGM to the newest Run3 ones ([electrons](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/RecoEgamma/ElectronIdentification/python/Identification/cutBasedElectronID_Winter22_122X_V1_cff.py), [photons](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/RecoEgamma/PhotonIdentification/python/Identification/cutBasedPhotonID_RunIIIWinter22_122X_V1_cff.py));\r\n> \r\n>   * clean up, removing HEM/HEP plots (which were relevant in 2017) and removing trigger paths which are no longer in the menu.\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n> This PR is a follow up of #42049 . In the latter, the update of the `egmGsfElectronIDsForDQM` module to include (via VID) only new Run3 electron IDs had created issues to non-EGM DQM, such as TOP, B2G and ParticleNet. In order to address this, the current PR updates the electron IDs used by non-EGM DQM too. Other POGs and PAGs have been informed and have followed up on [CMSHLT-2876](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSHLT-2876).\r\n\r\n\r\nFYI: @cms-sw/egamma-pog-l2\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

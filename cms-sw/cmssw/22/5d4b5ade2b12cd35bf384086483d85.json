This become possible after upgrade of CMS physics for magnetic  monopole simulation.\r\n\r\nMagnetic monopole physics configuration and all other exotica particle configurations are moved in one place and are controlled via flags of g4SimHits. Additional fragment is added to demonstrate list of custom parameters for Exotica simulation. \r\n\r\nOld CustomPhysics interfaces are preserved, a new interface CMSExoticaPhysics is added. \r\n\r\nThis modifications are pure technical and no change in mainstream production is expected.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 64, "comments": 7, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1525767515", "deletions": 300, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 23165, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Cleanup of exotic physics configuration and Geant4 physics lists", "updated_at": "1525769898", "user": "civanch"}

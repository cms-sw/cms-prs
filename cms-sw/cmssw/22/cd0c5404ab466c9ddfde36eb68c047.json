In addition, a pointer to the `DQMStore` object is cached in several plugins.  This PR removes explicitly caching of the `DQMStore` pointer.  In addition, many C++ improvements are included related to ownership semantics, updated syntax, etc.\r\n\r\nTo actually move to using the `IBooker` and `IGetter` interface will require more effort.\r\n\r\nClang-format has been run for this PR--those changes are included as a separate commit.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 26, "comments": 22, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1536088413", "deletions": 3850, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_3_X", "number": 24467, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "SiStripMonitorClient cleanup", "updated_at": "1537965166", "user": "knoepfel"}

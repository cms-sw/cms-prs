In addition, a pointer to the `DQMStore` object is cached in several plugins.  This PR removes explicitly caching of the `DQMStore` pointer.  In addition, many C++ improvements are included related to ownership semantics, updated syntax, etc.\r\n\r\nTo actually move to using the `IBooker` and `IGetter` interface will require more effort.\r\n\r\nClang-format has been run for this PR--those changes are included as a separate commit.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 26, "closed_at": "1551340868", "comments": 71, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1536088413", "deletions": 3803, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "030540c2258466e7420118ab3dd217c491d6f4ca", "merged_at": "1551340868", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 24467, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "SiStripMonitorClient cleanup", "updated_at": "1551340868", "user": "knoepfel"}

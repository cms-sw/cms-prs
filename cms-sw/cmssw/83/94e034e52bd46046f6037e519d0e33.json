With this PR, the calculated sum of the pTs of the unclustered particles is stored, and can be accessed with metSumPtUnclustered(), similar to metSignificance().\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nAll tests have been run, and were passed.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nbackport of #28370, needed for nanoAODv7\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "changed_files": 9, "closed_at": "1585550083", "comments": 32, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1584988979", "deletions": 24, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "backport-ok", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "requires-external", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "d19efa1c6c77f9b3e445e6dce0dc147f5e1332b6", "merged_at": "1585550083", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 29276, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 11, "state": "closed", "title": "keeping MET sumPtUnclustered (backport of #28370)", "updated_at": "1585569328", "user": "danbarto"}

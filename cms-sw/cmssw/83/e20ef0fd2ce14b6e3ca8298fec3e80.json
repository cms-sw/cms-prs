In other words, it selects events containing triplets of different objects from `col1`, `col2` and `col3` which form two pairs with a common element (1,3) and (2,3). Collections `col1`, `col2` and `col3` could be the same or different collections, and types of objects in the collections can be same or different.\r\n\r\nUsing this template class a filter called `HLT3DoubletPFTauPFJet` is defined using `col1=col2=col<PFTau>` and `col3<PFJet>` which it will be used in a newly developed DoublePFTau+PFJet HLT path.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 3, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1643384298", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["hlt-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 36828, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 5, "state": "open", "title": "Add HLTDoubletSinglet filter", "updated_at": "1643393178", "user": "mbluj"}

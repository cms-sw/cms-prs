In other words, it selects events containing triplets of different objects from `col1`, `col2` and `col3` which form two pairs with a common element (1,3) and (2,3). Collections `col1`, `col2` and `col3` could be the same or different collections, and types of objects in the collections can be same or different.\r\n\r\nUsing this template class a filter called `HLT3DoubletPFTauPFJet` is defined using `col1=col2=col<PFTau>` and `col3<PFJet>` which it will be used in a newly developed DoublePFTau+PFJet HLT path.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1643964140", "comments": 14, "commits": 9, "created_at": "1643384298", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["hlt-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "400549b9edb82a1de317e9ee30bae29f9e3e1048", "merged_at": "1643964140", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 36828, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 29, "state": "closed", "title": "Add HLTDoubletSinglet filter", "updated_at": "1643964140", "user": "mbluj"}

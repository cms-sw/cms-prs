This caused problems during merging as the ParameterSet registry grew, as reported in https://cms-talk.web.cern.ch/t/high-memory-usage-in-merge-alcareco-job-for-promptreco-run373536-zerobias17/29655.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the RECO configurations was in how the DQM sequences were assigned to DQM Paths. One source for random shuffling was found to be in ConfigBuilder in case the expansion of the DQM sequence specifier leads to duplicate sequences.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the path ordering, and adds a test for it.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe added unit test succeeds (and failed without the fix)\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

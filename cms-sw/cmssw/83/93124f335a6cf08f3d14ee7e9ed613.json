Monitoring service is now thread safe and properly supports multiple CMSSW streams and threads.\n- new asynchronous file reading mode (using multiple threads/buffers) in the FedRawDataInputSource\n- file locking is now done with a polling lock instead of a blocking one for decreased NFSv4 locking latency\n- monitoring rework and adjustments to the format of JSON metadata: definition can also be generated by the new implementation, as seen in the reco output module, micro and ministate legend is written in the FU working directory.\n- other misc. fixes and cleanups\n\nNote: fixed compilation error from the previous pull request attempt.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "changed_files": 50, "closed_at": "1395341072", "comments": 30, "commits": 105, "created_at": "1393502653", "deletions": 1971, "labels": ["core-approved", "daq-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "5f2b88d56446d00fd687bf84e538baedf08a795f", "merged_at": "1395341072", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_1_0_pre5", "number": 2661, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 24, "state": "closed", "title": "multithreading, file input, monitoring improvements in EventFilter/Utilities for 71X", "updated_at": "1412662044", "user": "smorovic"}

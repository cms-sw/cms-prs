It still crashes, but in a 'nicer' way.\n\n(forward port of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/14407 )\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1462877508", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1462774690", "deletions": 21, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "2f684333d5702a6b3cce6fda7a05ad20ebadc3dc", "merged_at": "1462877508", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 14408, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add DQMStore::getElement whichs throws an exception instead of a nullptr (81x)", "updated_at": "1462877508", "user": "dmitrijus"}

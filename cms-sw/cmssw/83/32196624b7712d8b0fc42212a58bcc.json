Instead of checking for layer 1, we check if the chamber # changed (since the GE2/1 demonstrator only consists of layer 1, so the layer 1 check never passes, which then means the superchamber isnt built, which means the chamber isn't added to the geometry).\r\n\r\nNo changes expected from workflows.\r\n\r\n@jshlee @bsunanda \r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with a description of the feature proposed or problem addressed, specifying:\r\n  - what changes are expected in the output if any, \r\n  - what other PRs or externals it depends upon if any,\r\n  - link to any additional material useful to provide a documentation for this PR (slides, JIRA tickets, related pull requestes, hypernews, TWiki or Indico pages)  -->\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI have been using the GEMGeometry built here to check the position of the chamber (eg checking #36470 now).

Additionally to the moving of the CTPPSDirectProtonSimulation plugin (renamed PPSDirectProtonSimulation to follow the newest convention) from `Validation/CTPPS` to a dedicated `SimPPS/DirectSimProducer` subpackage, the configuration scripts calling this latter are also reshuffled to define a more concise, and era-based steering of the PPS direct simulation.\r\n\r\nConsequently, this latter can now be added sequentially to a standard configuration via a standard cmsDriver customisation flag, e.g.\r\n```cmsDriver.py [...] --customise SimPPS/Configuration/Utils.setupPPSDirectSim[Mini]AOD```\r\n\r\nAdditionally, a new 2022 PPS era was introduced in preparation to future conditions, both in reconstruction and in direct simulation. To ease the development of later conditions, the `ctpps` era is now considering run 3 detectors occupancy as its default scheme, and modifiers are only introduced for 2016-17 (with no pixels and no diamond subdetectors respectively)\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nWe performed a [bin-by-bin comparison](https://lforthom.web.cern.ch/lforthom/public/pps-simu-validation) of every distribution/profile introduced earlier in direct simulation validation tool and did not spot any noticeable difference.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with any link to  -->\r\n\r\nBefore submitting your pull requests, make sure you followed this checklist:\r\n- [x] verify that the PR is really intended for the chosen branch\r\n- [x] verify that changes follow [CMS Naming, Coding, And Style Rules](http://cms-sw.github.io/cms_coding_rules.html)\r\n- [x] verify that the PR passes the basic test procedure suggested in the [CMSSW PR instructions](https://cms-sw.github.io/PRWorkflow.html)\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 40, "comments": 22, "commits": 41, "created_at": "1654638709", "deletions": 740, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "dqm-pending", "geometry-pending", "operations-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "new-package-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 38280, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 4, "state": "open", "title": "[PPS] Direct simulation as sequence", "updated_at": "1657882324", "user": "forthommel"}

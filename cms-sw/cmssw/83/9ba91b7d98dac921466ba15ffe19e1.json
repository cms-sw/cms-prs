Currently in the Heavy Ion runs, we are seeing ~30% data-emulator disagreement in the Online DQM: https://tinyurl.com/ydzbs6wf\r\n\r\nFor this to work, the most recent change to the external conditions in L1Trigger/L1TMuon/data (pulled into the \"master\" branch on September 25 [1]) must be in CMSSW_10_3_1.  @rekovic , @thomreis , or anyone else: do you know how to see what external conditions are included in a given CMSSW release?\r\n\r\nIf these externals are not there yet, I'll have to make another commit to modify this branch, so that it will work for the DQM.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nAndrew  \r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/cms-data/L1Trigger-L1TMuon/commit/29a8863fecaee9fc692a54f2c8fea3fb0a312d56", "branch": "CMSSW_10_3_X", "changed_files": 10, "comments": 0, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1541758328", "deletions": 65, "labels": [], "number": 25169, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "EMTF new LCT coordinate conversion LUTs for 10_3_X DQM", "updated_at": "1541758328", "user": "abrinke1"}

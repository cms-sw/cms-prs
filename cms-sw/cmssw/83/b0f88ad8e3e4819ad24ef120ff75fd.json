This is currently done using an utility in EventFilter/Utilities, which has been enhanced for this scope.\r\nFrom this information, the Physics Declared bit is computed, and added into the report summary profile.\r\nNOTA BENE: this is a temporary solution, until a well implemented unpacker for TCDS is made available in CMSSW.\r\n\r\nThe PR also resurrects a MonitorElement in DQMEventInfo showing the HLT path selection in the DQM input source DQMStreamerReader.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 12, "closed_at": "1490851289", "comments": 17, "commits": 11, "created_at": "1490262908", "deletions": 415, "labels": ["comparison-available", "daq-pending", "dqm-approved", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-rejected", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_9_1_X", "number": 18045, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Revive beam information, physics declared bit, and HLT event selection for online DQM", "updated_at": "1490851289", "user": "dmitrijus"}

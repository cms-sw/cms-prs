No changes expected for run2. For phase1, the only expected change is the added range for eta plots.\n\n@rovere @VinInn \n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": "1454748153", "comments": 24, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1454493467", "deletions": 184, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "47c63a4deb1110708551530796077262f4b9cce5", "merged_at": "1454748153", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 13172, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Update tracking validation for phase1", "updated_at": "1476957095", "user": "makortel"}

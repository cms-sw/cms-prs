As a placeholder recent pp data is used.  A new `rawPrimeDataRepacker` sequence is introduced to drop the strip info and rename the raw data collection, emulating what will happen at the HLT.  Previously, the approximated clusters were produced, but the strip info was not actually dropped, such that this new raw data label wasn't needed/implemented.\r\n\r\nThe strip info is also now dropped in the Run 2 raw prime workflow (140.58).   \r\n\r\nFinally, the approximated cluster collection is renamed to hltSiStripClusters2ApproxClusters, as this will be the name of the collection coming out of the HLT, as discussed in [JIRA](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSHLT-2521)\r\n\r\n@icali @abaty @FHead @Martin-Grunewald \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested w/ wfs:  \r\n140.58, 140.6, 159.02\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

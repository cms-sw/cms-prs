Only one file is affected (TTStubBuilder.cc), and one line in this file. The PS modules can build up to 2 stubs per seed. It was set to one until now. So this is a very minor change (1->2)\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe code change was tested with a private CMSSW version. As expected a small increase of the stub rate was observed in the PS module (less than 5% in any cases @ PU200). \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1624628264", "comments": 26, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1624344308", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "6243eb57b2446d98c399dd7c2be4fd2ea9fc7d0c", "merged_at": "1624628264", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "number": 34204, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix in the MPA stub building code", "updated_at": "1624628264", "user": "sviret"}

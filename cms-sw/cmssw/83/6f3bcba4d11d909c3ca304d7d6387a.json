This module preserves all monitoring elements (and therefore summary tests) by use of maps containing relevant luminosity block information as part of a CaloL1 namespace structure used as a part of the run cache. This PR should make PR #31678 obsolete.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nAll code compiles, and I have checked that a min bias data workflow reproduces the same histograms between the old online module and new online module. I have also verified that error plots between the old and new version of the online module yield the same error information in the same way by comparing on Run 315273 (a 2018 HI run with HCAL mismatches at CaloL1). Online monitoring should remain unchanged. As well, the PR seems to pass the basic test procedure suggested in the CMSSW PR instructions.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nThis PR is not a backport", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1605633003", "comments": 32, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1604332990", "deletions": 327, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "c77f047fe55ee75d4586e21cc8e89d7201e9830f", "merged_at": "1605633003", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 32004, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 7, "state": "closed", "title": "Move CaloL1 online DQM to Global", "updated_at": "1605633003", "user": "aloeliger"}

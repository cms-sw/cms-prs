The removed conditional check is redundant with nearby logic, and causes issues in Phase2 workflows when `lastHERing` is `0`, whereby the legacy, $\\leq$ Run2 algorithm is always selected, regardless of `HcalTPChannelParameters` content. No changes are expected for < Phase2 workflows, and non-trivial changes _are_ expected for Phase2 workflows.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCompiles and a private Phase2 workflow runs without issue.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

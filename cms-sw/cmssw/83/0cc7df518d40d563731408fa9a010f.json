[valDB report](https://hypernews.cern.ch/HyperNews/CMS/get/relval/13837/3/1.html) ).\r\nThis PR fixes the premixing case.  \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nPR validation has been carried out by @tsusa by comparing the pixel valid hit occupancy maps in the baseline CMSSW_11_0_X branch for premixing with and without this PR and compared with classical mixing (tested earlier to work correctly).\r\nI report here one example for BPix Layer 1:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5082376/64092106-a5412380-cd53-11e9-9d97-cb9305dc3868.png)\r\n\r\nmore information is contained in this [presentation](https://cernbox.cern.ch/index.php/s/V8XrBlPMsMbk8iv).\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\n\r\nThis PR is not a backport.\r\ncc:\r\n@tsusa @veszpv @tvami \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1567531043", "comments": 19, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1567395243", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["bug-fix", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved", "urgent"], "merge_commit_sha": "a329cef5dfc5a5c61f01513f3e8d127259a3921c", "merged_at": "1567531043", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27912, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix simulation of the pixel bad components on the FED channel basis for PreMixing", "updated_at": "1567661075", "user": "mmusich"}

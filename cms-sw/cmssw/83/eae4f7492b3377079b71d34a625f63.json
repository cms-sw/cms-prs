The using modules were classified into two categories:\r\n\r\n1. Modules creating Lumi based histograms (ie. they call `setLumiFlag`) and\r\n1. Modules which do other work at Lumi boundaries\r\n\r\nSeparating the two makes it possible to only have those modules which actually have Lumi based histograms to be LuminosityBlockProducers. This decreases the number of data products in the `edm::LuminosityBlock` and allows for more efficient running of the transition.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 91, "comments": 32, "commits": 13, "created_at": "1541786955", "deletions": 499, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_4_X", "number": 25188, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 8, "state": "open", "title": "Explicitly set which DQM modules use LuminosityBlock transitions", "updated_at": "1544800405", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

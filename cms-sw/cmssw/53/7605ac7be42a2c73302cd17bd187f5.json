Since the introduction of rootmap files in CMS, it is expected that the class will already be loaded.  So this pull request simply modifies the test to return success in this case.\nThis test still has utility in ROOT 6 because it will still fail if the class is not loaded, so it serves as a test of the functionality of rootmap files.\nPlease merge this pull request as soon as convenient.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_ROOT6_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1417645803", "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1417624745", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "core-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "a83d69d25811ab8d80719c2084a7ab5ef1c382df", "merged_at": "1417645803", "merged_by": "ktf", "number": 6773, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Modify test so it is OK if class already loaded (rootmap)", "updated_at": "1418189170", "user": "wmtan"}

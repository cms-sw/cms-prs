They should be double.\nThis PR removes the use of obsolete conditional compilations from the framework, now that C++11 and ROOT6 are supported from now on.\nIn particular, _ _CINT__, _ _MAKECINT__, _ _GCCXML__, _ _REFLEX__, and CMS_NOCXX11 are no longer ever set, GCC11_OVERRIDE always evaluates to \"override\", and ROOT_VERSION_CODE is always larger that the ROOT releases to which it is being compared.\nNote that _ _ROOTCLING__ is still used, so uses of _ _ROOTCLING__ are untouched by this PR.\nThis clean up is for Core Software only. Code outside core software is not touched.\nThis PR should not affect the compiled code at all.\nNote also that all uses of std::atomic<T> in the framework are transient, so they do not need to be protected from ROOT. This is unchanged by this PR.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 66, "closed_at": "1447690087", "comments": 13, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1447455689", "deletions": 429, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "tests-started"], "merge_commit_sha": "c6428c7f15de14d9f7e7eae92ee6da3a9c1b694c", "merged_at": "1447690087", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 12420, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Remove obsolete conditional compilations in Framework only", "updated_at": "1447713729", "user": "wmtan"}

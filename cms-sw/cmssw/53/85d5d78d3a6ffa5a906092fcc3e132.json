Moreover, it allows some performance improvement for that code.\r\n\r\n=== Later comment:\r\n\r\nI realized that not even #39261 was backported to 12_5_X, and that was a real bug fix for the L1T Phase2 DQM. I cherry picked also that PR here, then.\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nIt builds, and it was already tested in master\r\n\r\nbackport of #39283, #39297 and #39261\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 8, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1662800669", "deletions": 56, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "l1-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "bug-fix", "backport-ok"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 39363, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Simplify L1TPhase2MuonOffline and fix L1TRate_Offline and L1TStage2CaloLayer2Offline [CMSSW_12_5_X]", "updated_at": "1662824077", "user": "perrotta"}

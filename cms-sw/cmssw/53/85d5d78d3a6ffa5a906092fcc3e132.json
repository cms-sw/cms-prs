Moreover, it allows some performance improvement for that code.\r\n\r\n=== Later comment:\r\n\r\nI realized that not even #39261 was backported to 12_5_X, and that was a real bug fix for the L1T Phase2 DQM. I cherry picked also that PR here, then.\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nIt builds, and it was already tested in master\r\n\r\nbackport of #39283, #39297 and #39261\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1663047679", "comments": 13, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1662800669", "deletions": 56, "labels": ["dqm-approved", "l1-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "bug-fix", "orp-approved", "backport-ok"], "merge_commit_sha": "d80b1fb1a929fdb145f7a858c5551111266f0d4c", "merged_at": "1663047679", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 39363, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Simplify L1TPhase2MuonOffline and fix L1TRate_Offline and L1TStage2CaloLayer2Offline [CMSSW_12_5_X]", "updated_at": "1663047696", "user": "perrotta"}

Moreover, it allows some performance improvement for that code.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nIt builds, and it was already tested in master\r\n\r\nbackport of #39297 \r\n(since I can declare only one of them to have the backport flag assigned, let me put the last merged one here)", "branch": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 1, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1662800669", "deletions": 49, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "l1-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 39363, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Simplify L1TPhase2MuonOffline [CMSSW_12_5_X]", "updated_at": "1662800696", "user": "perrotta"}

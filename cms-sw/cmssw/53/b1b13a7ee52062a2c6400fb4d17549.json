They can indicate the decay of a long-lived particle in the muon endcap system and have the potential of increasing sensitivity in physics searches by a factor 20. \r\n\r\nThis PR introduces `CSCShowerDigi` object and producer in the trigger. They can either be \"loose\", \"nominal\", or \"tight\", depending on how many hits were recorded in a chamber. The `CSCShowerDigi` are produced in addition to the regular CSC trigger primitives and are sent to the EMTF. They are therefore of type `CSCDetIdCSCShowerDigiMuonDigiCollection_simCscTriggerPrimitiveDigis__`. The trigger data has already been upgraded to include additional bits for hadronic showers (see [DN-20-016](https://gitlab.cern.ch/tdr/notes/DN-20-016/blob/master/temp/DN-20-016_temp.pdf)). For the CSC->MPC->EMTF path, 4 `HMT` bits per chamber per BX have been allocated. In the EMTF sector processors we're planning a simple logic block that checks the presence of a shower (e.g. one nominal shower, or two loose showers).  For the EMTF->uGMT 3x2 bits are available per BX per trigger sector. In our current design we would use 1 or 2 bits. That will be done in future PRs.\r\n\r\nAdditional documentation in [DN-20-033](https://gitlab.cern.ch/tdr/notes/DN-20-033/blob/master/temp/DN-20-033_temp.pdf) and in [this presentation](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1006558/contributions/4227898/attachments/2187396/3696178/HadronicShowerTrigger_20210204.pdf).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested with H->2s->4b/4d samples  below\r\nhttps://cmsweb.cern.ch/das/request?view=list&limit=50&instance=prod%2Fglobal&input=%2FHTo2LongLivedTo4b*%2FRun3Winter20DRPremixMiniAOD-110X_mcRun3_2021_realistic_v6-v2%2FGEN-SIM-RAW\r\n\r\nAlso tested with WF 11634.0.\r\n\r\n```\r\n11634.0_TTbar_14TeV+2021+TTbar_14TeV_TuneCP5_GenSim+Digi+Reco+HARVEST+ALCA Step0-PASSED Step1-PASSED Step2-PASSED Step3-PASSED Step4-PASSED  - time date Thu Feb 11 11:30:07 2021-date Thu Feb 11 10:42:32 2021; exit: 0 0 0 0 0\r\n1 1 1 1 1 tests passed, 0 0 0 0 0 failed\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n@tahuang1991 ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 20, "closed_at": "1615013122", "comments": 11, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1613061619", "deletions": 25, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "dqm-pending", "l1-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 32880, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 4, "state": "closed", "title": "CSCShowerDigi format and producer (HST-I)", "updated_at": "1615013123", "user": "dildick"}

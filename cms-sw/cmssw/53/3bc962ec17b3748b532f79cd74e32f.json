The reason is that some thread will probabilistically handle zero events resulting from the first-come-first-serve principle to arrange events to threads. We enlarge the event number from 10 to 50 to fix this issue.\r\n\r\nPlease see more details in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/34527#issuecomment-907664078.\r\n\r\nBesides, the waitTime in this workflow will be set to the default value (reverting e27c1367ab1790b236a38bee7699ea19e9053b3a), given the timeout issue in ExternalGeneratorFilter has been permanently solved in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/34815.\r\n\r\nA backport to 12_0_X and 10_6_X is also needed.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nWorkflow 573 runs in the 4-thread mode.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1630403697", "comments": 10, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1630327231", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["generators-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "pdmv-approved", "orp-approved", "upgrade-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "bfe1358739b8b35aa1a1c9495e792be3b4232fcf", "merged_at": "1630403697", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "number": 35072, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix the random segfault of RelVal workflow 573", "updated_at": "1630403697", "user": "colizz"}

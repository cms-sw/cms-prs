This package has been used by multiple analyzers in SLHC as is, but if need be I can make the same move to CommonTools/RecoAlgos as was done in 76X.  Let me know.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "changed_files": 11, "closed_at": "1447180488", "comments": 7, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1446734457", "deletions": 570, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "dqm-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "Next CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "number": 12273, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Me0 global reco selectors", "updated_at": "1447180488", "user": "dnash86"}

This set of supercrystals are known to be problematic by the ECAL LED experts and are being monitored. However it does not affect the quality of physics data and so in order to avoid the DQM displaying them as BAD constantly the quality criteria for them are being changed. The list of supercrystals tower ids are stored in the data file `SClist.dat`\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis PR was validated by running the Standard Ecal calibration workflow on a test run and observing the DQM output file on an offline DQM test gui to confirm the code changes work as expected. The plots were also approved by the ECAL LED expert.\r\nThe PR was also validated by running the DQM relval workflow 136.874 using the runTheMatrix script\r\n`runTheMatrix.py -l 136.874 --ibeos`\r\n\r\n###\r\nThis PR is a backport of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/37378 to have the changes available in CMSSW_12_2_X used in production at the moment. \r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_12_2_X", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1648462702", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_2_X", "number": 37380, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Change quality criteria for some supercrystals in the Ecal Endcaps for LED Quality plots [CMSSW_12_2_X]", "updated_at": "1648462723", "user": "abhih1"}

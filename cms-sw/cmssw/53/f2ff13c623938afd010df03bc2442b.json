This pull request fixes the segfault so that the exception is thrown.\nThis pull request also improves exception messages that occur on an empty file list for the secondary source when playback mode is not used.\nThis code bug has been there for a long time. This segfault has been observed as far back as 5_3_X.\nPull request requested in 7_0_X by David Lange.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1394096503", "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1393965374", "deletions": 8, "labels": ["core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "d6dd6577a9572c6a2b5a9f5993295da782c713d0", "merged_at": "1394096503", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_0_X", "number": 2718, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Avoid segfault in playback mode if no files specified", "updated_at": "1394116301", "user": "wmtan"}

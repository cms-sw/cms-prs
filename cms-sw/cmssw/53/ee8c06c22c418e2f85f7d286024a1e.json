This PR fixes that. If a CLCT is on the edge, the (D)CFEB number is changed when the CCLUT-corrected half-strip crosses the (D)CFEB boundary.\r\n* In addition, 3 class members are added to store the number of strips, half-strips and (D)CFEBs for a chamber.\r\n* I also changed `bool noDigis` (which is used as a double-negative)  to `bool hasDigis`. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested on a 10 GeV prompt muon sample produced with 11_0_X.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nBefore submitting your pull requests, make sure you followed this checklist:\r\n- verify that the PR is really intended for the chosen branch\r\n- verify that changes follow [CMS Naming, Coding, And Style Rules](http://cms-sw.github.io/cms_coding_rules.html)\r\n- verify that the PR passes the basic test procedure suggested in the [CMSSW PR instructions](https://cms-sw.github.io/PRWorkflow.html)\r\n\r\n@tahuang1991 @msd14", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1617005968", "comments": 14, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1616546018", "deletions": 86, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "2e998e278aee85c8f19cbba6c47ef06ca3487b01", "merged_at": "1617005968", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 33254, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix an incorrect (D)CFEB number assignment in the CSC CLCT producer for Run-3 L1T (CCLUT-12)", "updated_at": "1617005968", "user": "dildick"}

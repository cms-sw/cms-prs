To activate this iteration a flag is added in order to be able to turn off this part of the code and don't interfere with the current algorithm. These [slides](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/files/8770320/HLT-Muon-Displaced_2022-05-25.pdf) contain information regarding the problem that we observed and this solution. In slide 7, the performance is shown (compare yellow and brown histograms) and more information regarding the rates and timing is in the backup.\r\n\r\nTo briefly summarise the PR we have:\r\n\r\n**Added parameters:**\r\n\r\n- `displacedReco`: flag to turn on this seeding.\r\n- `SFHld` and `SFHd`: scale factors to fine tune the displaced seeding.\r\n\r\n**Algorithm:**\r\n\r\n- The idea is to iterate over all the TOB and TEC layers but removing the L2 eta cut that can kill some potential seeds for displaced candidates (see slides).\r\n- We generate both hitless and hit seeds but using as input the TSOS at the outer tracker boundary instead of the one updated at IP (`tsosAtIP`).\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1653952894", "comments": 20, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1653468606", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["hlt-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved", "muon"], "merge_commit_sha": "01acc8f2b96803dd5a10c64476f18fb18eb2ce82", "merged_at": "1653952894", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 38076, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 10, "state": "closed", "title": "Implemented new strategy to generate OI seeds for displaced muons", "updated_at": "1653952894", "user": "alexsr-98"}

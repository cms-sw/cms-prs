The replacement logic works pretty well for Sequences/Tasks/Modules in Paths/Sequences/Tasks (e.g. thanks to https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/27480). This PR proposes to make the replacement of Paths/EndPaths/Tasks consistent in Schedule too.\r\n\r\nResolves https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/35624\r\nResolves https://github.com/makortel/framework/issues/304\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nFramework unit tests run.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1634165023", "comments": 11, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1634060502", "deletions": 7, "labels": ["core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "d68bfe91bc4faa34756931b98318d1f4a72d60e1", "merged_at": "1634165023", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "number": 35630, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Be consistent when replacing a Path/EndPath/Task in a Process that is also in a Schedule", "updated_at": "1634165023", "user": "makortel"}

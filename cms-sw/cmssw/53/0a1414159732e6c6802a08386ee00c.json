The change is strictly gated by the `run3_upc` modifier and therefore does not affect standard pp workflows or non-UPC production.\r\n\r\nNo changes to event content definitions outside the `run3_upc` context are introduced.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nValidated with `CMSSW_15_1_X`, need to backport to `CMSSW_15_0_X`\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1771024851", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "xpog-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 50142, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Keep very forward neutrals and nuclear fragments in prunedGenParticle for HI UPC runs [backport to 15.1.X]", "updated_at": "1771141873", "user": "michael-pitt"}

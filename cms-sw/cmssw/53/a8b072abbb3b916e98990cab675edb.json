This feature has been useful when creating test SiStrip Bad component payloads in preparation of the 2018 Heavy Ion data-taking, to study the effect on tracking of removing selected problematic APVs (which during data-taking with the tracker in Hybrid mode, were always being readout non zero-suppressed).\r\nI profit of this PR to introduce also a unit test for the `SiStripBadModuleConfigurableFakeESSource` module, which is used to produce SiStrip Bad Component payload for MC production.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "comments": 3, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1546505214", "deletions": 23, "labels": ["alca-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_5_X", "number": 25578, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Allow SiStripBadModuleConfigurableFakeESSource to mask single APVs", "updated_at": "1546505642", "user": "mmusich"}

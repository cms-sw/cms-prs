Unpacker is modified to point to the proper sample when filling the 5BX histograms (the middle BX is the \"standard\").\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nFor testing, the unpacker is modified to fill 5 times the EcalDigisBx for 5BX inside the \"if(N_BX==1)\" since now we always get BX=1, so the 5BX histograms can get filled for testing (this modification is for our own testing purpose so is not included in this PR). The codes can be compiled and are tested with an offline DQM workflow \"runTheMatrix.py -l 10823.0\", the 5BX histograms show up in the DQM root files and are properly filled.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with any link to  -->\r\n\r\nBefore submitting your pull requests, make sure you followed this checklist:\r\n- verify that the PR is really intended for the chosen branch\r\n- verify that changes follow [CMS Naming, Coding, And Style Rules](http://cms-sw.github.io/cms_coding_rules.html)\r\n- verify that the PR passes the basic test procedure suggested in the [CMSSW PR instructions](https://cms-sw.github.io/PRWorkflow.html)\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1619266846", "comments": 11, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1619158877", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "300f39db00c471b3555ded1a82c272d305c520ce", "merged_at": "1619266846", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "number": 33510, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "Modify CaloLayer1 DQM for 5BX needed for Ecal", "updated_at": "1619266847", "user": "hftsoi"}

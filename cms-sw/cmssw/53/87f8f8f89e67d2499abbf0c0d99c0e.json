In\nthis case, one must provide explicitly the correct input tag via\nconfiguration or in the constructor.\n\nThe same treatment is applied to L1GlobalTriggerRecord and\nL1GtTriggerMenuLite.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1441364883", "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1438196552", "deletions": 122, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "l1-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 10460, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Input tag for L1GlobalTriggerReadoutRecord from provenance.", "updated_at": "1441364883", "user": "vasile-ghete"}

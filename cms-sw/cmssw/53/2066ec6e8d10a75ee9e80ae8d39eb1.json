As deprecated options are removed, some changes there don't apply\r\n- fix for forever trying to acquire a file lock (timing out). In rare cases this was causing processes to get stuck on an old run, mostly in case of hardware problems\r\n- FastMonitoringService was making assumptions about seeing only one lumisection at the time (#21141).  Processing of multiple lumi blocks is however still not possible with current DAQ output module implementation.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1513662626", "comments": 44, "commits": 12, "created_at": "1512648984", "deletions": 257, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "daq-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "5d6c2cb55f72cef7f1ad44a6b9be09b780bb3630", "merged_at": "1513662626", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_0_X", "number": 21658, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 11, "state": "closed", "title": "DAQ updates", "updated_at": "1513662626", "user": "smorovic"}

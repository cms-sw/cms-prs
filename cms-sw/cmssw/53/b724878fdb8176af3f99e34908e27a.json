These can be followed up in a subsequent PR. \r\nThis PR is meant to allow the SiPixel DB contact to have access to this type of validation early on in the submission process, as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRelies on private tests.\r\nThis is an example of plot that can be obtained with the following command:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngetPayloadData.py --plugin pluginSiPixelDynamicInefficiency_PayloadInspector --plot plot_SiPixelDynamicInefficiencyPUParametrization --tag SiPixelDynamicInefficiency_phase1_2023_v2 --time_type Run --iovs '{\"start_iov\": \"1\", \"end_iov\": \"1\"}' --db Prod --test ;\r\n```\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5082376/220854550-7fb407ea-2e8a-434d-a165-b14e16fcdaaa.png)\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

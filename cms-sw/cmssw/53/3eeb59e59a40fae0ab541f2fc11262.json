There is no more impilicit conversion to `void\n*` since C++11.\n\n`std::getline()` returns `std::basic_istream` and implicit conversion to\n`void *` does not happen. Since C++11 you can use any function returning\nreferences to streams as loop conditions. This is because `explicit\noperator bool() const` was introduced since C++11.\n\nTo validate stream status you need to use `operator!`, `fail()`,\n`eof()`, `bad()` and friends from `std::basic_ios`.\n\nSigned-off-by: David Abdurachmanov David.Abdurachmanov@cern.ch\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 11, "closed_at": "1442494637", "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1442474621", "deletions": 23, "labels": ["alca-approved", "comparison-available", "db-pending", "l1-approved", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "9249429c2bbf7fee536884cc0f3e15499cf13791", "merged_at": "1442494637", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 11309, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Resolve issues with streams (getline(), stream to void *, etc)", "updated_at": "1442494637", "user": "davidlt"}

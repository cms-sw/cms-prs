Previously this section of code passed an `EncodedTruthId` which is a derived class, but with an additional parameter used as an object index.  In this code the object index is given a dummy value, which anyway is inaccessible when the class is resolved to the `EncodedEventId` base class passed to the constructor.  So I just removed the dummy value and passed the `EncodedEventId` directly which should make the intention of the code clearer.  Also removed the comment that shows uncertainty about what the dummy parameter should be.\n\nI wrote this section of code originally but I can't remember why an `EncodedTruthId` was ever used.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1422005236", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1421931885", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "fully-signed", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "c0868514fa4a0dd520236705467f63b2008eadaf", "merged_at": "1422005236", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 7318, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix some obscure code in TrackingTruthAccumulator (still functionally identical)", "updated_at": "1422007007", "user": "mark-grimes"}

I recommend you start by reviewing the KF fit code (classes L1KalmanComb, KFParamsComb, L1track3D, L1fittedTrack, KFTrackletTrack, KalmanState). If there is a lot of work to do with these, we could consider a reduced PR with only the code needed for the Hybrid, dropping the code needed for the pure TMTT & pure Tracklet algos, which could then be added in CMSSW 11.2. Though it would require some editing to extract just these elements, and it is not guaranteed that 11.2 could read 11.1 MC samples.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nL1 track performance good.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 83, "closed_at": "1590130522", "comments": 120, "commits": 23, "created_at": "1585830634", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "l1-pending", "orp-approved", "pending-signatures", "requires-external", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "39527cd272d392d8877e6682e45a6f26017657db", "merged_at": "1590130521", "merged_by": "silviodonato", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 29381, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1123, "state": "closed", "title": "Addition of L1 tracking code for \"TMTT\" & (part of) \"Hybrid\" algorithms (L1Trigger/TrackFindingTMTT) ", "updated_at": "1590257508", "user": "tomalin"}

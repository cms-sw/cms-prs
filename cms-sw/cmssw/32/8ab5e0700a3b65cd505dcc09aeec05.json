But to implement quickly, I called many \"consumes\" in METProducer and passed tokens to classes in RecoMET/METAlgorithms. The code is ugly now. I will clean up the code when I can.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 8, "closed_at": "1380014635", "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1379955664", "deletions": 37, "labels": ["fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "acdf0fd8df7049be09ecf4ef3b8838e528aed0c4", "merged_at": "1380014635", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_0_0_pre5", "number": 904, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "use \"consumes\" for RecoMET", "updated_at": "1380922577", "user": "TaiSakuma"}

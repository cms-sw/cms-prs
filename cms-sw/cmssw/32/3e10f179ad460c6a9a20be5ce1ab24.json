This proposal was presented in the last Central DQM meeting([talk](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1092285/#13-tracker-dqm-on-monitoring-o)). In this PR, only the modules to monitor Tracks and Vertices are added. The sequence defined in this package is added to the ```DQMHarvestPixelTracking``` sequence. \r\nWe plan to follow this up with several other PRs to this package:-\r\n\r\n- modules to monitor digis, clusters and rechits. \r\n- Comparator modules to produce plots for GPU vs CPU comparisons \r\n\r\nA PR to cms-bot for new package will be done.\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nValidated with the Patatrack PixelOnly wfs. \r\n\r\n- CPU wfs: 136.885501,136.888501,10824.501,10824.505,10842.501,10842.505,11634.501,11634.505,11650.501,11650.505\r\n- GPU wfs:\r\n136.885502,136.888502,10824.502,10824.506,10842.502,10842.506,11634.502,11634.506,11650.502,11650.506\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\nNA", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": "1637538192", "comments": 22, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1635928388", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "8b07203182e23dcea298d3e5780de6becb19cfa5", "merged_at": "1637538192", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_2_X", "number": 35965, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 14, "state": "closed", "title": "TkDQM: Introduce monitoring package for pixel SoA products", "updated_at": "1637538192", "user": "sroychow"}

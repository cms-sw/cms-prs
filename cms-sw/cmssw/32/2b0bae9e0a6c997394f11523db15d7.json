Thank you, Giulio! This typo has been in the code for ROOT6 back as far as 7_0_ROOT6_X, but was only recently introduced into the code for ROOT5 only very recently. The effect of this but is that a loop possibly invoking destructors terminates immediately, thereby possibly causing a memory leak.\nI tested this fix with the unit test for the package and the entire short relval matrix, and all the tests pass.\nAs this is a bug fix, it should be expedited.\nThis fix will be identical in 7_4_X, 7_4_ROOT6_X, 7_5_X, and 7_5_ROOT5_X.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1427778246", "comments": 6, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1427745059", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "cb4b476b57386c01c6b961b68e1d57db945b24ee", "merged_at": "1427778246", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 8603, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix typo spotted by Giulio possibly causing memory leak", "updated_at": "1427819705", "user": "wmtan"}

Also useful for checking if a token ring or some cluster of FEs has recovered. Includes: \n- FE Status Error Occupancy Map (only error flags are counted\n- Integrity Error Occupancy Map\n- Digi, Rechit (filtered), and TP digi occupancy map\n- Rechit and TP energy map\n- Presample RMS map\n\n**Fixed bug in Presample Client**. RMS by LS should use entries by LS.\n\n**Extended x-axis range of SR / DCC event size.** In anticipation of larger file sizes during high lumi runs.\n\nIn conjunction with 81X PR https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/16113\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 16, "closed_at": "1476804665", "comments": 7, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1475727604", "deletions": 9, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "13cb43641b038db28bb661e625b427fc51848323", "merged_at": "1476804665", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 16112, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Duplicate key MEs for by lumi reset.", "updated_at": "1476804665", "user": "mbandrews"}

To avoid this at that time, I used a Python customization to turn off all options that might use this class.\n\nHowever, upon further investigation, the only use of the EE geometry in this class was commented out in September 2010: ae80cb2e3811a990547e17ea6a06871c0f3712b6.\n\nIn this PR, I've taken the most expedient solution of simply deleting all references to the EE geometry from this class. If ECAL RECO experts object for some reason, please propose an alternative solution. (Not sure who should be tagged...)\n\nTested with:\n\n```\nrunTheMatrix.py -w upgrade -l 11000.0\n```\n\nto make sure the Phase2 workflows still run, which they do.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1462357137", "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1462212641", "deletions": 16, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "4dd2d50eb7a7aef4414b7c6184fcd3925b63f04b", "merged_at": "1462357136", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 14333, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "remove unneeded EE geometry from EcalRecHitWorkerRecover", "updated_at": "1462357137", "user": "kpedro88"}

In the transformation there is a bug in the longitudinal momentum of the constituents (sin => cos) which makes the resulting shower less spherical than expected.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode checks passed, reproduced gen step samples for several SUEP configurations in use\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nIdeally we would like to backport this down to 10_6_X in case new UL-conditions MC is produced, and at least for releases active in Run 3 MC production. If I understood properly this means backporting it to all active intermediate ones (15_0_X, 14_2_X,14_1_X,14_0_X, 13_3_X, 13_2_X, 13_1_X, 13_0_X, 12_4_X, and 10_6_X as per [the IB page](https://cmssdt.cern.ch/SDT/html/cmssdt-ib/#/ib/CMSSW_15_1_X)), is it correct?\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1757606646", "comments": 10, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1756810362", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["generators-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "bug-fix", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "689942b3576b41f6265d38aa68bb484e9d650def", "merged_at": "1757606646", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_16_0_X", "number": 48830, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fixed bug on longitudinal momentum computation for SUEP constituents", "updated_at": "1757606646", "user": "cericeci"}

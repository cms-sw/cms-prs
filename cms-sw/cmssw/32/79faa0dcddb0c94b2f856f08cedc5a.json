It does two major things:\r\n1. Adds `cmsTritonConfigTool`, a general tool to inspect and edit config.pbtxt files. This tool has a specific mode `threadcontrol` to handle editing config files for the local fallback server, which was previously done (much less robustly) using `cat`, and a mode `checksum` to check and inject model checksums for versioning.\r\n2. Updates `TritonClient` to compare model checksums between the local model version (which is known to be the right one) and the remote model version on the server.\r\n\r\nThis PR is kept in draft mode until the other parts of #43695 are complete, otherwise workflows will fail in the meantime.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested SONIC workflows with this code in place and model checksums in config.pbtxt files, and everything runs correctly. Also tested with a wrong checksum to see that the exception is thrown.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nNot planned to be backported.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "comments": 3, "commits": 8, "created_at": "1704922365", "deletions": 61, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending", "heterogeneous-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "number": 43696, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Triton model versioning", "updated_at": "1705438166", "user": "kpedro88"}

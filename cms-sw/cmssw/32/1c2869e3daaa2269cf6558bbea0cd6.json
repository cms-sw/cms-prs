The skim is not throwing exception when the corresponding Global Tag has mismatches in the requested triggers, so when using such problematic GT in replay we see empty output files. We must make sure that we get paused jobs to prevent trash data from being produced. The change in this PR aims to ensure we get paused jobs and have the ability to retry the jobs and get the desired output data.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dummy GT was provided by AlCa, details available in [cms-talk](https://cms-talk.web.cern.ch/t/request-for-buggy-global-tag-for-deeper-testing-on-the-raw-skim-development-at-t0/122072/4). Such global tag was tested on the repacking of stream `ParkingDoubleMuonLowMass0` and we see all output files with 0 events.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 12, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1744112488", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "tests-started", "requires-external", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 47813, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "open", "title": "Make ReserveDMu skim throw exception upon mismatch in requested trigg", "updated_at": "1744171453", "user": "LinaresToine"}

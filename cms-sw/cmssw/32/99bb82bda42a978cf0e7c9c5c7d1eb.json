Thus argument-dependent lookup (ADL)\nis being used here to find `bool operator>(l1t::Jet&, l1t::Jet&)`.\n\nADL is done once all argument types are known, i.e., in template\ninstantiation location. It this case it happens in a few places from\n`BitonicSort.h` and `Stage2Layer2JetAlgorithmFirmwareImp1.cc`.\nThey all require template specialization: `BitonicSort<l1t::Jet>`.\n\nThe operator is not found on the first look up (unqualified lookup),\nbecause it's delcared after template delcaration. It's also not found in\nsecond look up (ADL), because it's not in a class's namespace, but in a\nglobal namespace.\n\nThe patch adds `bool operator>(l1t::Jet&, l1t::Jet&)` to `l1t` namespace\nto allow ADL to find the operator.\n\nResolves error with Clang.\n\nSigned-off-by: David Abdurachmanov David.Abdurachmanov@cern.ch\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1416914497", "comments": 4, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1416909691", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "18017fdb231f7811bdd44bfddfe490f4cdbfd17f", "merged_at": "1416914497", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 6582, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Move bool operator>(l1t::Jet&, l1t::Jet&) to l1t namespace", "updated_at": "1416914497", "user": "davidlt"}

This will be used to display streams differently in monitoring. Optionally, a PSet name can be specified and, if found in the configuration, will be parsed for per-stream overrides of this parameter (can be used e.g. if more specific differentiation of DAT streams is required for monitoring or merging).\n- by default activate empty-LS mode and disable micro-merging in CMSSW. This has been already configured as such in production HLT menus for some time.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 14, "closed_at": "1463894060", "comments": 22, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1463471637", "deletions": 13, "labels": ["comparison-available", "daq-approved", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "hlt-approved", "orp-pending", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "a5406f7f6ed7db097ca57a512243a36f02ed60ac", "merged_at": "1463894059", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 14528, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Adding merging type (DAQ) and changing defaults", "updated_at": "1463894060", "user": "smorovic"}

Following the information in this post [1], the exceptions can be just taken from the builtins instead of the exceptions module in python 2 as well, which makes the code python 3 compatible. There was also another spot in CMSSW where the former `exceptions` module was imported, so I changed this one too.\r\n\r\n[1] https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27030933/python-2s-exceptions-module-is-missing-in-python3-where-did-its-contents-go\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI can use `edmDumpEventContent` with python 3 when I take this PR and run `python-modernize -n -w .` on top of it.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\n\r\nNo backport intended.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1572552167", "comments": 13, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1572306755", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "da612cf8ff71da8eedb65fb4fdd6899bb86633ee", "merged_at": "1572552167", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 28299, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Take python exceptions from builtins", "updated_at": "1572552168", "user": "guitargeek"}

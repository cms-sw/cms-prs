Removal of `TupleOrPointerType` in `SoAParametersImpl`. `TupleOrPointerType` is replaced by member functions that return the data address (and the stride in the case of an Eigen Column).\r\n2. Removal of the `checkAlignment` function in `SoAParametersImpl`. The function was mostly code duplication across the four specializations of `SoAParametersImpl`. It is now a free function in the `cms::soa::detail` namespace.\r\n3. `AccumulateColumnByteSizes`  and `computePitch` were essentially code duplication. It is replaced by `ComputePitch` which is a rename of `AccumulateColumnByteSizes` and replaces the function `computePitch` entirely.\r\n4. `printColumn` is implemented as a `PrintColumn` struct now\r\n5. Manual alignment checks are replaced by the `checkAlignment` function\r\n6. Removal of unused `_DECLARE_VIEW_CONSTRUCTION_BYCOLUMN_PARAMETERS` and `_DECLARE_VIEW_MEMBER_INITIALIZERS_BYCOLUMN` macros\r\n7. Removal of a large comment of a dumped SoA in `SoALayout` by a test case that actually dumps an SoA and checks the output string\r\n8. `_deepCopy` was implemented in `PortableDeviceCollection` and `PortableHostCollection` with the exact same functionality. It is not moved to the `portablecollection` namespace and called in both places.\r\n\r\n\r\nFyi @felicepantaleo ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 16, "comments": 19, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1770982994", "deletions": 313, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending", "heterogeneous-pending", "tracking", "trk", "ml-pending", "ngt"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_1_X", "number": 50131, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 16, "state": "open", "title": "SoA backend cleanup", "updated_at": "1771579356", "user": "Electricks94"}

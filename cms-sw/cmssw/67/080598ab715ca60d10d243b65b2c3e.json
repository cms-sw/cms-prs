This PR is a backport of [PR#23087](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/23087) to CMSSW master.\r\n\r\nThe new changes introduced are:\r\n(1) Added alarm to trigger primitives quality summary plot -- the plot now turns RED when the fraction of towers in a given SM that have TTF4 flag set is greater than a threshold fraction which is currently set to 0.1.\r\n\r\n(2) Added trend plots for the total number of towers in EB and EE with TTF4 flag set.\r\n\r\n(3) COKE in the endcaps can mask on the strip level, not just the tower level; the ttFlag container now has meaningful values above 4 for situations where not all strip in a tower are masked. This requires the following changes to the DQM code:\r\n    (3.1) TTF4 occupancy now counts all towers with ttF >= 4, not just ttF == 4\r\n    (3.2) Flag mismatch for low interest, medium interest regions: only perform check if ttF == 1 or ttF == 3\r\n    (3.3) For data/emulator comparisons, ignore towers with ttF > 4\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_10_1_X", "changed_files": 15, "comments": 5, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1524836963", "deletions": 29, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "dqm-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_1_X", "number": 23088, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Changes to ECAL TTF4 DQM plots (for P5 production)", "updated_at": "1524921904", "user": "tanmaymudholkar"}

Made a comparison between TICL v3 and TICL v4. There is some improvement in v4, as seen in the plot, in HGCAL region.\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5052706/197183638-8a8c3b4a-6657-4305-a580-5f67cef6cd13.png\" width=\"500\">\r\n\r\nUsing the same sample, some showershape variables at HLT were checked. The small changes in shape look okay.\r\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5052706/197234603-f583d502-1add-4d6f-bbd7-4dac2d523986.png\" width=\"260\"> <img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5052706/197235992-92adb022-bbd7-4d81-a4f0-4034ebce5d0e.png\" width=\"260\"> <img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5052706/197237083-d069f8d5-88a8-4cdc-90e9-38816c76f22d.png\" width=\"260\">\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 10, "comments": 2, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1666361022", "deletions": 146, "labels": ["hlt-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_6_X", "number": 39820, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "open", "title": "[EGM HLT@Phase2] Move to TICL v4", "updated_at": "1666445659", "user": "swagata87"}

In order to do so harvester is using aggregated histograms provided by workers. Results are then saved in corresponding db object.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, PR contains DQM module which is suppose to run after the diamond sampic reconstruction and produce plots relevant for the validation of current offset.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nPR was successfully tested locally(run file&configuration included in /CalibPPS/TimingCalibration/test). In addition, the matrix test was conducted, yielding expected null structure.\r\n\r\nPR presentation: https://indico.cern.ch/event/1069114/#15-pps-time-alignment-of-diamo\r\n\r\n\r\nfor the reference-memory consumption results presented during alcaDb meeting:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52073715/131370735-de5df7d9-9d27-4ea4-bb2c-1b478dd7cccb.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 16, "closed_at": "1630883815", "comments": 47, "commits": 8, "created_at": "1629973112", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["alca-approved", "dqm-approved", "operations-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "ceaf5d16706e868def2d18d5b6fa2cf2cc05ea69", "merged_at": "1630883815", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "number": 35029, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 19, "state": "closed", "title": "PCL of diamond sampic offset calibration", "updated_at": "1630883815", "user": "ChrisMisan"}

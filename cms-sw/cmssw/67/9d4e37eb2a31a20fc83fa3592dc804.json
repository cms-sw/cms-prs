Motivation to allow it is that `clone()` is (similar to) a constructor call with defaults taken from the cloned-from module. Semantics is that the parameters in `pset` override those in `edmodule`. Passing multiple PSets along `edmodule.clone(pset1, pset2)` is allowed as long as `pset1` and `pset2` have distinct parameters, similar to `EDModule` constructors.\r\n\r\nOriginal discussion was in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/33354#issuecomment-820580988.\r\n\r\nResolves https://github.com/makortel/framework/issues/124\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nFramework unit tests pass.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1620688232", "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1620647117", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "6247472c51af7283ade352e704c898c1122541f4", "merged_at": "1620688232", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "number": 33673, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Allow edmodule.clone(pset) for PSet to override parameters", "updated_at": "1620688232", "user": "makortel"}

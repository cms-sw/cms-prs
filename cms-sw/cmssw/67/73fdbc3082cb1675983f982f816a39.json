HLT menu `/online/collisions/2022/2e34/v1.4/HLT/V2` was run on `/eos/cms/tier0/store/data/Run2022E/EGamma/RAW/v1/000/359/871/00000/fcf81596-54ed-45d3-9dee-32dec392f246.root`. Trigger result was same, before and after this PR. For example:\r\n```\r\nHLT name | nEventPassed before PR | nEventPassed after PR\r\nHLT_Ele32_WPTight_Gsf_v17 | 376 | 376\r\nHLT_Ele23_Ele12_CaloIdL_TrackIdL_IsoVL_DZ_v21 | 30 | 30\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe PR test can be done preferably by enabling profiling to see if there is any extra CPU cost for the computation of determinants of sub-matrices.\r\n\r\nIf this fix is accepted, then a backport to data-taking release cycle would be nice.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1665252727", "comments": 14, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1665062264", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved", "tracking", "egamma"], "merge_commit_sha": "0ae2a78157c7226caf11a868a9b71d4c388a5835", "merged_at": "1665252727", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_6_X", "number": 39656, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "[GSF tracking] Add full Sylvester criterion for positive definite check", "updated_at": "1665252727", "user": "swagata87"}

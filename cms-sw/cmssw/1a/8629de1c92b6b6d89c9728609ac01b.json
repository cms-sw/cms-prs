This PR adds the dependence into the `BuildFile.xml`, as well as `DataFormats/GeometryVector` that also, in principle at least, should have been added in #38329. Not sure why this wasn't caught by regular IBs, but UBSAN is pickier in having the dependencies declared.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nNone (edited in the web)", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1658962103", "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1658937085", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["simulation-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "f7c501aad8f9e5c59aa0bf3e697800fc5dc386d2", "merged_at": "1658962103", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 38874, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add missing dependencies to SimG4Core/CustomPhysics/BuildFile.xml", "updated_at": "1658962103", "user": "makortel"}

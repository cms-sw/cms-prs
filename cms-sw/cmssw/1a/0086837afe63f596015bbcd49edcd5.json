For now LSF submission is still the default, but condor submission is fully supported.\r\nNote that the submission could be made more efficient, as at the moment now we submit one job per cluster - submitting multiple jobs per cluster requires some overhaul of the current workflow. I have some ideas but this will take a bit more time to get right, and so will follow later.

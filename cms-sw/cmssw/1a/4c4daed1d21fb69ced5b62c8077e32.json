This removes old unused prescaled bits [seen missing in 2023 relvals](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/41629#issuecomment-1585546537), and [replaces them with L1 DPG/Menu group suggested bits](https://github.com/cms-l1t-offline/cmssw/issues/1136#issuecomment-1590925682)\r\n\r\nIn theory, this should close L1T issue tracker https://github.com/cms-l1t-offline/cmssw/issues/1136\r\n\r\n### PR validation:\r\n\r\nWorkflow 141.008 was run and step 3 logs no longer complain about missing single jet bits.\r\n\r\n### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nThis PR is not a backport, and will likely not need backporting.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 10, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1686824018", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_2_X", "number": 41972, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Change L1 2023 Relval Single Jet Bits to Current Menu Bits", "updated_at": "1686903101", "user": "aloeliger"}

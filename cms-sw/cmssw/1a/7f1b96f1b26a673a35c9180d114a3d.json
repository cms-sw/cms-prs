Visual inspection of the `classes_def.xml` file showed that the `X::Layout` type alias has not been specified, while the read rule explicitly uses the `X::Layout` in a string form, and therefore a dictionary has to be specified in order to avoid header parsing. This PR adds entries for the `X::Layout` type aliases.\r\n\r\nIn addition this PR uses the `rntupleStreamerMode` attribute consistently for the `PortableHostCollection` types.\r\n\r\nFor more information on \"why\" see https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/49458, https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/48824.\r\n\r\nResolves https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/49470\r\nResolves https://github.com/cms-sw/framework-team/issues/1703\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe `DataFormatsHGCalDigi_xr.rootmap` file has entries for all the four `X::Layout` type aliases.

Here I propose:\r\n\r\n* To simply promote the MVAValueMapProducer to a global EDProducer to not duplicate the GBRForests\r\n* To wrap the employed `StringCutObjectSelector<>` and `StringCutObjectFunction<>` into a little class together with a `std::mutex` to make their operator() thread safe\r\n* Make the MultiToken thread safe so it can be used in global producers\r\n\r\nThe matrix tests pass and the changes were also a little bit battle tested with the multi-threaded ntuplizer in my MultileptonAnalysis.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 14, "closed_at": "1542173393", "comments": 22, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1541154514", "deletions": 419, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "8ff77aeb0e810cfafa4171067838ffa1b6429edf", "merged_at": "1542173393", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_4_X", "number": 25101, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "Egamma IDs back to global cache", "updated_at": "1542173393", "user": "guitargeek"}

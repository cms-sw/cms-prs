Here I propose:\r\n\r\n* To simply promote the MVAValueMapProducer to a global EDProducer to not duplicate the GBRForests\r\n* To wrap the employed `StringCutObjectSelector<>` and `StringCutObjectFunction<>` into a little class together with a `std::mutex` to make their operator() thread safe\r\n* Make the MultiToken thread safe so it can be used in global producers\r\n\r\nThe matrix tests pass and the changes were also a little bit battle tested with the multi-threaded ntuplizer in my MultileptonAnalysis.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 14, "comments": 11, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1541154514", "deletions": 418, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_4_X", "number": 25101, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "open", "title": "Egamma IDs back to global cache", "updated_at": "1541516077", "user": "guitargeek"}

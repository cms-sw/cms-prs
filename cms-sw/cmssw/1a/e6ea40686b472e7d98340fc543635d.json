We don't need this anymore as there aren't any legacy modules anymore. It simplifies the code and makes maintenance easier.\r\n\r\nThis also removes the overload of the usesResource function with no arguments. It was possible to call this from a \"one\" type module and then it would behave like a legacy module.  We don't want to preserve that ability. Nothing in CMSSW is currently using it. With this change, you will be required to supply a name for usesResource as an argument.\r\n\r\nIn a couple places, there is an if-else block and only one conditional path remains after the change. That block remains identical except for indentation.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nMostly this is deletions. It builds successfully even after checkdeps is run. Framework unit tests pass.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 9, "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1709218940", "deletions": 142, "labels": ["core-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 44271, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Remove code related to legacy modules and SharedResources", "updated_at": "1709307150", "user": "wddgit"}

When that effort is complete, the intent is to submit a separate PR deleting that ParameterSet when all module construction is complete.\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses the last module in the Sim* subsystems with such a reference.\r\n\r\nThis copies the required parameters into a struct and holds that until it is needed instead of holding a reference to the entire ParameterSet.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe change is fairly trivial, but I'd like to run a manual test that the values are going through OK. The parameters are set in g4SimHits_cfi.py (only there). I've so far unsuccessfully been looking for an existing test that executes the function CMSEmStandardPhysicsEMMT::ConstructProcess(). This looks like code that might still be actively used. I am still looking. Could someone point me to a test that runs it, maybe a RelVal number?\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1691692183", "deletions": 12, "labels": ["simulation-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-rejected", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_3_X", "number": 42535, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "CMSEmStandardPhysicsEMMT, don't hold ref into main ParameterSet", "updated_at": "1691766091", "user": "wddgit"}

One in LogErrorEventFilter and one in Path. Both could cause rare data races and crashes.\r\n\r\nThe one in LogErrorEventFilter was causing rare crashes in the IBs recently and that caused us to notice the problem. This is a minimal fix. We are going to discuss this more and possibly make further changes related to this in the future. See Issue #44413 for discussion.\r\n\r\nThe problem in Path has been there 4 years and no one has noticed or connected any problems to it. The problem in LogErrorEventFilter has been there 5 years and the problems were only recently noticed. I'm not sure if this is worth back porting or not. The problem should be occurring only very rarely...\r\n\r\nIn part the fix is a test. The problems are not reproducible so we are not 100% sure this fixes the problem. We plan to observe the IBs after this is merged and see if the recently noticed problems stop occurring.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRelies on existing tests.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1711118763", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["core-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "tests-started", "requires-external", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 44517, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Fix two spinlocks", "updated_at": "1711119326", "user": "wddgit"}

No DQM changes are expected as a result of this change.\r\n> \r\n> Also changes Calo Summary DQM configuration to use GT digis instead of test crate digis, which is more correct.\r\n\r\n\r\n### PR validation:\r\n\r\nSequence has been confirmed to work in failing workflows without crashing. HCAL reports this fixes the issue.\r\n\r\n### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

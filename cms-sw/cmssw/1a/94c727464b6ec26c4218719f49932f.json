No DQM changes are expected as a result of this change.\r\n> \r\n> Also changes Calo Summary DQM configuration to use GT digis instead of test crate digis, which is more correct.\r\n\r\n\r\n### PR validation:\r\n\r\nSequence has been confirmed to work in failing workflows without crashing. HCAL reports this fixes the issue.\r\n\r\n### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nThis backport is required for eventual backport to 14_0 for MC production with corrected DQM.", "branch": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 7, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1729669112", "deletions": 20, "labels": ["l1-pending", "dqm-approved", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "backport"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 46487, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[14_1] Remove unused L1TCaloSummary DQM sequences causing issues with HCAL.", "updated_at": "1729845492", "user": "aloeliger"}

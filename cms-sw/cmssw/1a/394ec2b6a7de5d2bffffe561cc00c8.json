This was an oversight of the previous refactor work.\r\nThis fix was made based on the issue reported here: https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/30849.\r\n\r\nAlso, some functions of PFMuonAlgo were made static to simpler calls from GeneralTracksImporter(WithVeto).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n \r\nMade sure it compiles. Also ran matrix test 10824.0 (2018 ttbar) and made sure that the output doesn't have any change.\r\nAlso tested with 11634.0 (ttbar 2021) and 23234.0 (ttbar 2026D49).\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nThis is not a backport.\r\n\r\n@bendavid @guitargeek \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 8, "closed_at": "1596543625", "comments": 50, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1595932273", "deletions": 116, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "hlt-approved", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "10852c8b49ae681350db791aef73686149155fcf", "merged_at": "1596543625", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 30936, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "PFProducer fix for PFMuonAlgo's fillPSetDescription", "updated_at": "1596543625", "user": "hatakeyamak"}

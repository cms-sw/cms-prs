We observed different behavior on different architectures. It  crashes on machines with AVX512 registers available, whereas it works fine and returns empty tensors. \r\nIn some cases incompatible shapes for operators are reported by the TF engine.\r\n\r\nRelated issues: https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/45136, https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/44333\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a simple check for empty inputs in the central TensorFlow interface to avoid evaluation of the model for empty tensors. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nA new test has been added calling the TF inference with empty tensors.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 4, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1717583707", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved", "ml-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 45139, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Skip evaluation of TensorFlow model if inputs are empty", "updated_at": "1717584791", "user": "valsdav"}

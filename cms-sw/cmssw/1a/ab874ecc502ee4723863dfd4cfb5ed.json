The bug was introduced in Mar 2008 around CMSSW_2_0_0_pre5 when the base class ::deposit method signature was changed.\r\n\r\nInstead of fixing this code, it seems more practical to just remove it.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1522680974", "deletions": 98, "labels": ["code-checks-pending", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 22821, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "remove ExtractorFromDeposits in  RecoMuon/MuonIsolation", "updated_at": "1522681009", "user": "slava77"}

The bug was introduced in Mar 2008 around CMSSW_2_0_0_pre5 when the base class ::deposit method signature was changed.\r\n\r\nInstead of fixing this code, it seems more practical to just remove it.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1522769202", "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1522680974", "deletions": 98, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "c7aa14355f1741c95bce70a997cb840254201b6b", "merged_at": "1522769202", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 22821, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "remove ExtractorFromDeposits in  RecoMuon/MuonIsolation", "updated_at": "1522769202", "user": "slava77"}

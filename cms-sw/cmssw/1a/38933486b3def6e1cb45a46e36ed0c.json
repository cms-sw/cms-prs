At least, they do not look harmful.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nIt builds, and the short matrix runs\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 96, "closed_at": "1621927722", "comments": 22, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1621435029", "deletions": 1938, "labels": ["alca-approved", "analysis-approved", "code-checks-approved", "dqm-approved", "fastsim-approved", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "hlt-approved", "orp-approved", "pdmv-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "dfd0d1dc4786721ed41d7500305a075998a49479", "merged_at": "1621927722", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "number": 33784, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Include the updated header from Geometry/Records instead of the obsolete one", "updated_at": "1622362630", "user": "perrotta"}

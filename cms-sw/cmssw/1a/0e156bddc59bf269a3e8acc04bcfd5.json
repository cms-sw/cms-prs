ThePEG/Vectors/HepMCTraits.h itself did not included some types (like map) used by HepMCTemplate and since ThePEG is an external, instead of changing the external headers or requesting changes (or applying a patch) I just moved the entire header content into Herwig7Interface as shortcut. Let me know if that is NOT ok.

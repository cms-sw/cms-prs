The fix is just an explicit protection for pseudotrapezoids. I guess it could have been implemented using `isASubtraction()` , as [introduced in 31691](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/31691/files#diff-7823e114fef4afa095ad8272d17c4238L168), but this way looks safer to me.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1602225165", "comments": 16, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1602154931", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "9e1dfb02fa150445c05089e925d542b52542c024", "merged_at": "1602225164", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 31712, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "fix DDFilteredView::parameters() crashing with a pseudotrapezoid", "updated_at": "1602225165", "user": "namapane"}

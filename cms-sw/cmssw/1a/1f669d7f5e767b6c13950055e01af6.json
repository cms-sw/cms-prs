The base class contains common part of DeepTauId code while (existing) `DeepTauId` and (newly added) `DeepTauIdSONIC` derived classes provide, respectively, direct interface and interface via TritonService to a TF DeepTau model. The common code was moved from the `DeepTauId` class.\r\n\r\nThis PR requires SONIC model and configuration files to be added with https://github.com/cms-data/RecoTauTag-TrainingFiles/pull/12.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nPR validated using the test script [runDeepTauIDsOnMiniAOD.py](https://github.com/cms-tau-pog/cmssw/blob/04875cec17701624459defb0dc30bdf7e9f26ef9/RecoTauTag/RecoTau/test/runDeepTauIDsOnMiniAOD.py). To enable/disable SONIC one should set the [useSONIC](https://github.com/cms-tau-pog/cmssw/blob/04875cec17701624459defb0dc30bdf7e9f26ef9/RecoTauTag/RecoTau/test/runDeepTauIDsOnMiniAOD.py#L15) flag appropriately. Tested with and without SONIC and confirmed the outputs are in both cases the same as with the unmodified code.\r\n\r\nTested also wf. 12434.0 (ttbar 2023 MC) which is a kind of \"typical\" full Run3 workflow (GEN->NanoAOD).\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 9, "comments": 17, "commits": 11, "created_at": "1698759540", "deletions": 2137, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "operations-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "requires-external", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_3_X", "number": 43158, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "open", "title": "Implementation of DeepTau SONIC producers", "updated_at": "1699007735", "user": "mbluj"}

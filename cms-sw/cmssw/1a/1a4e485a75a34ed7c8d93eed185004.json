In order to do that, a new option has been added to TICL_v4, during the _tracksters' merge step_, to disable the usage of MTD information that, at present, is not part of the HLT reconstruction.\r\nAs an added enhancement, a slimmed and fully L1T-seeded Phase2 HLT menu has been added to the release, named `75e33_timing`, to be used to perform meaningful timing measurements.\r\n\r\nFor further information, please refer to today's [HLT Upgrade](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1324703/) meeting and presentation therein.\r\n\r\nThe old TICL_v3 iterations have been removed from the repository, since `GitHub` will automatically keep their history.\r\n\r\nA backport to `13_1_X`, the baseline release for the coming HLT Upgrade Annual Review, will be submitted soon.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRun any Phase2 workflow with HLT menu w/o crashes.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 15, "comments": 4, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1694520596", "deletions": 370, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "hlt-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_3_X", "number": 42759, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Move Phase2 HLT to ticl_v4 ", "updated_at": "1694531816", "user": "rovere"}

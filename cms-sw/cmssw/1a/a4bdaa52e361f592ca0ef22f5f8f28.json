(a better tune is surely possible)\n\nat PU35 for ttbar events we save 35% in GeomDetCompatibilityChecker::isCompatible itself while\nTrajectorySegmentBuilder::redoMeasurements becomes a factor 2 faster.\n\nI do expect some iterations to finalize the parameter setting (and fix misspelling)\n\np.s.\nmost of the changes are due to the migration of Chi2MeasurementEstimator to fillDescriptions...\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 100, "closed_at": "1451967879", "comments": 33, "commits": 15, "created_at": "1450960687", "deletions": 336, "labels": ["alca-approved", "comparison-available", "fastsim-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "a1467bd6a5a9f8062fa22c05e24c2e81b0e89622", "merged_at": "1451967879", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 12846, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 7, "state": "closed", "title": "Use straight-line propagation for \"stiff\" tracks  to check GeomDet compatibility", "updated_at": "1451967880", "user": "VinInn"}

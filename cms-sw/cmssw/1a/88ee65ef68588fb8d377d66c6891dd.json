This is necessary as part of trying to speed up HGCal digitization, where calling HepJamesRandom becomes very expensive. This achieves a factor of ~3 speed up in the RNG over HepJamesRandom.\n\nImplementation taken from:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xorshift#xorshift.2B\n\nPlease let me know if there are any unit tests or standard tests I should perform.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 21, "closed_at": "1479287227", "comments": 34, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1459787614", "deletions": 18, "labels": ["comparison-available", "core-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 13921, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 6, "state": "closed", "title": "XorShift128Plus Random Engine for RandomNumberGeneratorService", "updated_at": "1479287228", "user": "lgray"}

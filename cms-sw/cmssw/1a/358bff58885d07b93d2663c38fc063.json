It only needs to remain exclusive when writing EoLS file marker in FU.\n- writing lock acquire waiting times statistics in fast monitoring service json (for later injection into elastic)\n- print warning if there is mismatch between BU (file) and TCDS record lumisection or orbit number\n- explicit report of exception from input source to the fast monitoring service so that output can be suppressed (was not being detected with adler32 exception thrown)\n\nEquivalent of 75X pull request #9385\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 10, "closed_at": "1433499769", "comments": 6, "commits": 9, "created_at": "1433167557", "deletions": 24, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "daq-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "12b6782774b52b0e5cd0c0a3a1e9dd801b5cc390", "merged_at": "1433499769", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 9386, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Online file-locking improvements (74X)", "updated_at": "1447408242", "user": "smorovic"}

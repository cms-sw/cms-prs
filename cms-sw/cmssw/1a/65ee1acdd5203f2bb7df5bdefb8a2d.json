If the query\nfailed with a fatal error, then the open may fail immediately.\n\nAs the open status is not checked, we proceed to waiting for the\ncallback - which hangs indefinitely.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1420656055", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1420639413", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-rejected"], "merge_commit_sha": "467edf5999c3c7c8664629d5ee8d94b85054ccef", "merged_at": "1420656055", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 7063, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "Check immediate return status from XrdClFile::Open call.", "updated_at": "1420656055", "user": "bbockelm"}

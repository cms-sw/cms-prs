This is needed for a centralized production for the analysis of charm production Photonuclear events for which some small private productions have already been made. For more information [see here](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMS/UPCPbPbanalyses2023)\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nAll code compiles and has passed offline code checks. After checking with GEN coordinators we have also verified that code would not break nominal pythia setup. These tests as well as general information regarding the PR were discussed in the [weekly HIN Forward  PInG meeting](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1377803/contributions/5792424/attachments/2791995/4869151/UPC_ForwardMeeting_02012024.pdf) . \r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nThis PR will be backported to CMSSW_13_0_X which is the release meant for heavy ion production.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please delete the text above after you verified all points of the checklist  -->\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 28, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1706807078", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["generators-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 43840, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Pythia8 photon flux", "updated_at": "1708807316", "user": "hjbossi"}

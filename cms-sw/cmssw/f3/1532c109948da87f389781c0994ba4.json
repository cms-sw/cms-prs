The mixing module has this odd behaviour where all collections in the signal sample are available to the accumulators, but for the pileup events only the collections in mixObjects are available.  Before this fix I'm pretty sure EcalHitsEK were only being digitised for the signal event.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1406870769", "comments": 2, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1406870457", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "Next CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "number": 4859, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Update Shashlik customs", "updated_at": "1427128036", "user": "mark-grimes"}

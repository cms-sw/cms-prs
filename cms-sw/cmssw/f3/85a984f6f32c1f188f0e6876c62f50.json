This is not thread safe.\nThis pull request removes the mutable data members.  Instead, a vector is passed in to the functions for filling by the functions.  There is no need to store the vectors in the class.\nTested with checkdeps -a and the relval matrix.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 10, "closed_at": "1383830141", "comments": 4, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1383689188", "deletions": 65, "labels": ["fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "873aea58fd30924cc34cb6716878c0eea5ad8f1a", "merged_at": "1383830141", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_0_0_pre9", "number": 1347, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix thread safety issues by removing mutable data members of MuonDetIdAssociator ", "updated_at": "1406907321", "user": "wmtan"}

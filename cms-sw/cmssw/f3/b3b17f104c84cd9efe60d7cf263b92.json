It only calculates the HT of generated particles from pythia8. I think for the actual generation I need it to be backported to 7_1_X ( the release that will actually be used) and  7_6_X as the release the output will be in.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any question. \n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1448418385", "comments": 11, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1448024250", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "generators-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "0911fb19509f7570dbc58a0461c77d323ee12476", "merged_at": "1448418385", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 12516, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "adding Pythia8 Filter for genparticles HT", "updated_at": "1448418385", "user": "alefisico"}

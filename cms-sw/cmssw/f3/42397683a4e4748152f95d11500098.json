This time I attack the BOOST_FOREACH macro which is made obsolete by the range based loops. About half of the occurrences are in this package, to I handle it separately.\r\n\r\nI noticed in some example codes that BOOST_FOREACH is on one hand often slower than the range based loop, but on the other hand the optimizer often mitigates that so they are equal. So maybe this change actually makes the reco a bit faster, but probably not.\r\n\r\nCould not test due to DAS failures today.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 27, "closed_at": "1539324806", "comments": 13, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1538488822", "deletions": 138, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "20277130d6f6591851e41629e181393fc2197fc2", "merged_at": "1539324806", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_4_X", "number": 24789, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Replaced BOOST_FOREACH in RecoTauTag_RecoTau", "updated_at": "1539324806", "user": "guitargeek"}

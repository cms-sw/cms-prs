The complaint on missing dictionary for `std::unique_ptr<T>` came from the support code for `edm::View<T>`. The minimal fix was to specialize the `edm::detail::getMemberType` for `std::vector<std::unique_ptr<T>>`. That alone allows the `std::vector<std::unique_ptr<T>>` be produced by an EDProducer, and written to a file. Reading such a product from a file appears to currently work only if `T` has a dictionary, i.e. it does not work e.g. for fundamental types.\r\n\r\nAfter that it was natural to complete the support for `edm::View`, i.e. with this PR `edm::View<T>` can be used to read `std::vector<std::unique_ptr<T>>`.\r\n\r\nIn addition the \"friendly name\" transformation is improved to ignore the `std::default_delete<T>` from the full type name of `std::unique_ptr1` (among some other improvements in the parsing).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles, unit tests run.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 18, "closed_at": "1566942092", "comments": 21, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1566586096", "deletions": 105, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "2d8760ce595144e22241543828a157c4bfadaa21", "merged_at": "1566942092", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27861, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "Allow std::vector<std::unique_ptr<T>> be produced, and be read with edm::View<T>", "updated_at": "1566942092", "user": "makortel"}

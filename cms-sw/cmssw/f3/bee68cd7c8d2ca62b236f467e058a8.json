The very same algorithm has been already implemented by #4131 for general use. As the tau isolation is calculated separately, it was necessary to implement this also within tau ID software.\n\nThe default RECO sequence is not affected, no changes expected.\n\nThe new option can be utilized via\n\n```\n--customise RecoTauTag/Configuration/addWeightedIsolation_cfi.addWeightedIsolation\n```\n\nThe studies that show that this way of calculating isolation is superior to the previous ways of handling neutral isolation has been presented by Yuta at CPF: https://indico.cern.ch/event/322762/\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_2_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1410522242", "comments": 22, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1410332238", "deletions": 51, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "79d18ab57882b05ae9528253b2971cc27f2b3755", "merged_at": "1410522242", "merged_by": "nclopezo", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_2_X", "number": 5255, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 12, "state": "closed", "title": "Adding optional PU weighted neutral isolation to tau ID", "updated_at": "1458854084", "user": "jpavel"}

New monitoring elements are added to layer-1 DQM for the 3x6x32 bits. The modification is done in such a way that it works before and after the card addition.\r\n\r\nNote that the monitoring elements for HCAL FB4-5 are commented out, we will put them back once HCAL fixes them (FB4-5 are reserved bits and not used for LLP, but they are sending unphysical data there which layer-1 could not read out, causing discrepancies seen when comparing them).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nValidated by running offline DQM on past commissioning runs, it works as expected for current production firmware. This adds minor firmware status checks on top of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/41383 which has been tested online with new firmware.", "branch": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "changed_files": 5, "comments": 10, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1687199217", "deletions": 63, "labels": ["l1-pending", "dqm-approved", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "hcal"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "number": 42021, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 4, "state": "open", "title": "add layer-1 monitoring for new slot-7 cards [13_0_7]", "updated_at": "1687326268", "user": "hftsoi"}

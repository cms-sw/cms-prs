Stored vector of problematic strips analogously to \"PhiWedges\" inside of HcalHaloData class.\n- A description of the filter (+ motivation), along with application in Data/MC, is in the pair of slides in https://indico.cern.ch/event/438533/. \n- This adds ~130 bytes/evt to the reco BeamHaloSummary object\n- As for CPU time impact, the main operation is just a single loop through all the calotowers. If this still requires timing information, I will run igprof and report on the results here\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 15, "closed_at": "1442320503", "comments": 38, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1440446700", "deletions": 10, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "2ac51b1a1ba78ace918a8c29b4ec6002c3163b6c", "merged_at": "1442320503", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 10934, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 22, "state": "closed", "title": "hcal strip filter", "updated_at": "1443048234", "user": "aminnj"}

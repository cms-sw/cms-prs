This PR suggests to split off a GBRForest package from the former EgammaObjects package.\r\n\r\nIn a followup PR, the remaining EgammaObjects package could be removed, because all other classes except for the GBRForest are unused. I think we can't do both steps in one PR, because deleted CondFormats packages are not correctly \"poisoned\", and the GBRForest symbols are found in 2 different places then. That's at least the problem I had in the matrix tests.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCMSSW compiles, local matrix tests pass.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nNo backport intended.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 86, "closed_at": "1610632887", "comments": 25, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1607111253", "deletions": 112, "labels": ["alca-approved", "analysis-approved", "code-checks-approved", "db-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "7b5b1e829def27e98c52d42a8376b858c78b41ab", "merged_at": "1610632887", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 32392, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "New CondFormats/GBRForest package", "updated_at": "1610794374", "user": "guitargeek"}

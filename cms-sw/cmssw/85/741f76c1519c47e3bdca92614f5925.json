Previously, if the batch size did not match input_dim[0], an error was raised. This is not optimal for GNN models, where each input can have a different shape  for example, the number of nodes may differ from the number of edges. With this PR, the batch size is now updated dynamically based on input_dim[0].\r\n\r\nTagging @valsdav ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1754989073", "deletions": 9, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "ml-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 48725, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Update batch size in ONNX interface", "updated_at": "1756716380", "user": "Moanwar"}

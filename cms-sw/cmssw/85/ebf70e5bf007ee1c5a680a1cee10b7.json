This backport is needed, as this CMSSW version is used in the MC production campaigns for 2024 and 2025 MC events and therefore contain all important settings like the HLT menu.\r\n\r\nThe tau embedding method is used to estimate the genuine di-tau background from data. It is a common method used in analyses with tau leptons. More information about tau embedding can be found in the paper: [https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-0221/14/06/P06032](https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-0221/14/06/P06032)  \r\nIn principle, one can split the method into 4 steps, but technically there are at least 6 steps that have to be executed.\r\n\r\nTo produce tau embedding samples, one can use the cmsDriver commands shown in this [presentation](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1508508/contributions/6347811/attachments/3007650/5301994/Christian_Winter_status_on_tau_embedding_2025_02_03.pdf#page=27).\r\n\r\nThe PR contains the following commit #47299 and doesn't influence any other code then the one used for the tau embedding method.\r\n\r\nThere are also two other similar backport PRs: #47403 and #47404\r\n\r\nThe tau embedding method and these PRs were also presented in a [PPD](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1510579/#5-tau-pog-tau-embedding-method) and [RECO](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1517184/#6-tau-embedding-method-update) meeting.\r\nWith this PR we target a new release, probably CMSSW_15_0_1 or at least the one which is used for the MC campaigns in summer 2025.", "branch": "CMSSW_15_0_X", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 4, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1740155597", "deletions": 79, "labels": ["simulation-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_0_X", "number": 47424, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Backport to produce 2024 and 2025 Tau Embedding samples", "updated_at": "1740230249", "user": "winterchristian"}

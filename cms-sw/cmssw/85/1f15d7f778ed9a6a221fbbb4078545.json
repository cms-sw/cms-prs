Part of that is expected from information loss intrinsic to the procedure, but dedicated checks showed that in some events few perfectly valid seeds lead to no track reconstructed when data is repacked with the RAW' data format.\r\nThis has been shown to depend on the fact the currently the RAW' data format is not saving the list of SiStrip FED errors (collection  `DetIdedmEDCollection_siStripDigisHLT_*_*`) which is used in the tracking setup to construct the list of inactive componets:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/a5b91a1d0848665cc6f5d3ddb11be28272302e1c/RecoTracker/MeasurementDet/plugins/MeasurementTrackerEventProducer.cc#L405-L417\r\n\r\nwhich is then used in trajectory building.\r\nThis PR proposed to fix this issue by keeping the missing collection (2bb7f37fdc2c5ed211c120f1e17b14b655d61d9b, supposed eventually to come from the HLT) in the repack procedure and then to use it in the `MeasurementTrackerEventProducer` (1f49f6ee100618d603f6862ebad60294f144465d).\r\nAfter that is no longer necessary to run the SiStrip unpacker `siStripDigis` in the RAW2DIGI step, therefore that's excluded from execution profiting of the process modifier (6cc72b501cc8e3f44bf0e86529a539aefe729636).\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRun successfully `runTheMatrix.py -l 140.58 -t 4 -j 8 --ibeos`\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

This update initializes the default LUT arrays to a null value, then fills each with a bit-wise unity. I need to double check that this solution is acceptable to the calorimeter trigger experts, so it may get changed later.\r\n\r\n@iarspider this should hopefully fix the remaining warnings in `L1TCaloLayer1`.\r\n\r\n### PR validation:\r\n\r\nAll code compiles, passes the code checks, and has had code formatting applied. Because this is slightly more than a trivial technical fix, I have also tested that `runTheMatrix` workflows run without obvious complaint\r\n\r\n### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

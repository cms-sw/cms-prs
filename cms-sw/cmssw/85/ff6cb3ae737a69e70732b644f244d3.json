Additional validation within the CMSSW framework is ongoing.\r\n\r\nNote: This PR could potentially supersede #41932 as it contains all those changes plus the GetArray support, as discussed in the PR comments of #41932.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 21, "comments": 13, "commits": 16, "created_at": "1740716761", "deletions": 69, "labels": ["core-approved", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "changes-dataformats"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 47478, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Add GetArray support for TH2Poly histograms", "updated_at": "1741380265", "user": "ywkao"}

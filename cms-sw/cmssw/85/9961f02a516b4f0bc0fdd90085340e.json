The code was doing that on purpose. To make that clear, the code now explicitly calls the default constructor for the base class.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe code compiles using a gcc 9 IB.\r\nThis is a technical change (explicitly doing what the compiler was implicitly doing) and should not change results.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1565288820", "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1565204370", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "496eec60474ec393c18321a4e0144d37d660a41b", "merged_at": "1565288820", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27721, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Explicitly use default c'tor in muon DetId copy c'tors", "updated_at": "1565288820", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

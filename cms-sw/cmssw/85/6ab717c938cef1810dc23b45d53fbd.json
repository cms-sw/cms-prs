It also unifies the prefix and rules of protocols by converting the prefix to a rule. Therefore, codes handling prefix and rules are the same.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 11, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1691609245", "deletions": 30, "labels": ["core-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_3_X", "number": 42530, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 11, "state": "open", "title": "Fix chaining in rules and unify prefix and rules of protocols", "updated_at": "1691786496", "user": "nhduongvn"}

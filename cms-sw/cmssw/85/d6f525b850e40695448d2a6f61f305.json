We store the track quantities for pfCandidates as relative to the pfCandidate itself, which results in a better compression. We also dropped pfCandidate mass, because it is redundant w.r.t. pdgId. We also only store non-zero rechit energies, resulting in smaller data size when also storing the associated detIds. \r\n\r\nTo make the changes apparent in a backward compatible way we added new members to the data formats to flag these changes. \r\n\r\nThese changes, together with other updates to the HLT configuration not in this PR, result in a scouting event size of ~7.7 kb.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 8, "closed_at": "1651593425", "comments": 27, "commits": 9, "created_at": "1650545249", "deletions": 53, "labels": ["core-approved", "hlt-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "60913915c545dfbda21d099cfdb7b9f2281125ad", "merged_at": "1651593425", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 37646, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 4, "state": "closed", "title": "Optimizations to the Scouting Data Formats", "updated_at": "1651593425", "user": "dsperka"}

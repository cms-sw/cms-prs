(At the moment the selections are coded identically in the two python files).\r\n\r\nMy impression is that, if so, one should rather explicitly define all relevant parameters into the `clone()` function and avoid as such redefining the same module in two different places. Of course, if the TkAl people does not agree with me I will remove this PR.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nAt this moment the configurations and the sequences in Alignment/APEEstimation/python/AlcaRecoSelection_cff.py end up being identical to the previous ones.

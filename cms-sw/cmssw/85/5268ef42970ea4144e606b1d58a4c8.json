After offline investigation (mainly from @vbotta) some discrepancy was found when comparing the results from the `DiMuonVertexValidation` module (in the package `Alignment/OfflineValidation`) and `DiMuonVertexMonitor` (in the package `DQMOffline/Alignment`).\r\nThese were traced back to the fact that the DQM module (by default) selects the primary vertex closest to the di-muon vertex, while the one in `Alignment/OfflineValidation` selects the first one (presumably the hardest in the event, but not guaranteed because there is no re-sorting post-refit). This is addressed in 2e70c3b9b0a1004584c02be33e7debd107a7aa62 by offering the user the possibility to use the closest (to X decay vertex) or the first primary vertex.\r\nThe other two commits:\r\n   * 79451cfaeb1501f149aee6d3e530a98f91acee40 updates slightly the unit test configuration for `DiMuonVertexValidation`,\r\n   *  4839b20b27939a69ac9661f4c04be251daae280d adds some debug statement in `DiMuonVertexMonitor`, that were useful during the debugging process.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRun successfully:\r\n   * `scram b runtests_DiMuonVertex use-ibeos`\r\n   * `scram b runtests_testDiMuonVertexMonitor use-ibeos`\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

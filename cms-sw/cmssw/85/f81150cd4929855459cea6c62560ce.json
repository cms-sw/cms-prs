A single collection of FsrPhotons is stored, with indexes \"muonIdx\" and \"electronIdx\" to the closest muon or electron. Either of the indexes is always -1. Note that (as it was before) more than one photon can in principle be matched to the same lepton, so that \"masking\" of different photons or \"stealing\" by other leptons can be addressed at analysis level if needed.\r\n- Electrons now have fsrPhotonIdx, like it was for muons.\r\n- FSR are collected down to the minimum lepton pT, and with no gap in the overlap region (was: pt_mu>20 and eta_gamma outside [1.4, 1.6])\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested running on a RelVal sample and compared with the previous muon-only implementation.\r\n\r\n#### Notes \r\nNot sure of how PhysicsTools/NanoAOD/python/nanoDQM_cfi.py should be updated. Tried running prepareDQM.py, with no success. @mariadalfonso can you please advise on this?\r\n\r\n@namapane pls follow\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "comments": 11, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1638373311", "deletions": 19, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "xpog-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 36323, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "open", "title": "Include FSR for electrons (in addition to muons)", "updated_at": "1640173346", "user": "vpicco"}

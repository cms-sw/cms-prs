Doing so, the test is also extended as a `CUDA`, `HIP` and `Alpaka` version to show consistency. Furthermore, the documentation is extended to hint to users of the SoA to use `SOA_HOST_DEVICE` to ensure that element methods can be used in device kernels. \r\n\r\nA similar idea was promoted previously in #49203 by using `constexpr` to ensure that functions can run in device kernels. However, as shown, this method is not feasible for us due to a bug in the `nvcc` compiler. Hence, with this PR #49203 can be closed.\r\n\r\n@felicepantaleo fyi", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 8, "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1766069008", "deletions": 48, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-rejected", "heterogeneous-pending", "ngt"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_1_X", "number": 49671, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "open", "title": "Extended documentation and tests for SoA methods", "updated_at": "1769419100", "user": "Electricks94"}

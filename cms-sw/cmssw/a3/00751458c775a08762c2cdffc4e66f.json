I don't think this actually has any effect, but is just for cleanliness. (@ianna, please correct me if I'm wrong.) I also made the geometry script a tiny bit smarter.\n\n@boudoul, when I reran the geometry script, I noticed from the diff that the D4 geometry did not have the HGCal volumes in CaloGeometryBuilder... not sure how that happened. @ianna, will this cause problems?\n\nTested with 20000.0 and 21200.0 (FourMu, 2023D1 and 2023D4).\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1474955061", "comments": 9, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1474917021", "deletions": 14, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "1e4dfc5c2ee9eeb4050c06316b4fb9d61acb5e03", "merged_at": "1474955061", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 15991, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "remove CASTOR from CaloGeometryBuilder for 2023", "updated_at": "1474955062", "user": "kpedro88"}

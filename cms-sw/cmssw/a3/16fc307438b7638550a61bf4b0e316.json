The changes were also reported internally to Lisa Benato from the STEAM group and discussed in a recent [STEAM meeting](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1137448/).\r\n\r\nMonitoring of multiple TrimMass HLT paths only differing in pt/HT threshold was cut down to only a single threshold for each version. To be consistent with the HT-based version, monitoring of mjj and softdropmass was added for HLT_AK8PFJet400_TrimMass30. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe complete workflow was tested using `runTheMatrix.py -l 11634.0` verifying that the histograms are properly created. The changes were also tested by running the DQM and harvesting steps on different RelVal samples, to check whether the histograms are properly filled. The basic test procedure as instructed in the [CMSSW PR instructions](https://cms-sw.github.io/PRWorkflow.html) was run and passed all tests.\r\n\r\nI hope the above information is complete, if not I'd be happy to provide anything that might be needed.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 4, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1649934858", "deletions": 109, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 37570, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "B2G HLT DQM cleanup", "updated_at": "1649957950", "user": "finnlabe"}

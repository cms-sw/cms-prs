Since there is no physics validation done yet, I'm not sure this change should be backported to `12_4_X` and `12_5_X` (since there are dozens of instances of `HLTPFJetsMatchedToFilteredJetsProducer` running at HLT).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nNext to none.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

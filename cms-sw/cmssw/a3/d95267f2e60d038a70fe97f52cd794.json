Since there is no physics validation done yet, I'm not sure this change should be backported to `12_4_X` and `12_5_X` (since there are dozens of instances of `HLTPFJetsMatchedToFilteredJetsProducer` running at HLT).\r\n\r\n_Edit_ : changes are expected (see https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/39179#issuecomment-1241663125).\r\n\r\n - This PR removes duplicates in certain collections of HLT jets.\r\n - DQM modules that use the HLT jets passing certain jet triggers thus will have generally less entries (less jets), or jet-multiplicity distributions shifted to lower values.\r\n - In principle, even trigger results could change (1 jet duplicated N times would lead to passing a N-jet trigger before this PR, but not after the PR).\r\n - Differences might be more visible for lower-pT triggers, while at higher-pT I would expect less duplicates (and also we will have less stats to judge).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nNext to none.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported, please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nN/A", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1662992173", "comments": 22, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1661345318", "deletions": 8, "labels": ["hlt-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved", "jetmet-pog-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "e5ac8e997d5565e91eea5eaa91884a2b17a0fde4", "merged_at": "1662992173", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_6_X", "number": 39179, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "don't produce duplicate outputs in `HLTPFJetsMatchedToFilteredJetsProducer`", "updated_at": "1662992173", "user": "missirol"}

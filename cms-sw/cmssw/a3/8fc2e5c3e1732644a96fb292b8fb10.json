We use remote monitoring tool(RMT) for analysis of local hcal data(LED, LASER, PEDESTAL) with aims of looking for suspesion  channels and phi-symmetry monitoring. In plans  - to add psm for global runs to finalize psm preparation for calibration hcal data by method of moments and iterative method. Information is presenting on dedicated sites for analysis by calibration group experts.\r\nAbout CMT - certification monitoring tool. This tool analyse in details behaviour so named estimator as function of lumi-section. The aim - facilitate certification of hcal data. This tool produce as plots and tables. These information is presenting in dedicated sites for analysis by certification experts.\r\n\r\nCMT: new plots regarding GlobalRMT added; \r\ntiny update of some titles;\r\nupdate of condor related scripts;\r\n\r\nRMT: update on scripts to run crontab using local runs;\r\npsm-plots added: update on macros;\r\ngeneral cc-code was changed with energy-eraw exchange for HBHE;\r\n\r\ncomment:\r\n1) in this branch the structure of main code was changed from use of /src and /interface dirs to /plugin (Sunanda);\r\n2) because of updates for use of TFileService(Sunanda) the rmt/cmt scripts were corrected;\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 55, "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1637049280", "deletions": 4156, "labels": ["dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_2_X", "number": 36135, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 12, "state": "open", "title": "Preparation of RMT and CMT for Run3", "updated_at": "1637163682", "user": "zhokin2"}

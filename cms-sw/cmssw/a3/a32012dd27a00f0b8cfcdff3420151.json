While this was the case, the name was used in different plugin factories, which is technically allowed. This change uses the plugin factory name (3rd field in `.edmplugincache`) as part of the plugin name for the uniqueness check (by concatenating the two together with `?` as separator), and later strips out the plugin factory name.\r\n\r\nResolves https://github.com/makortel/framework/issues/641\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested the ~~command line~~ script on CMSSW_13_3_X_2023-08-16-1100 that the `SiPixelLorentzAngle` is no longer reported as duplicate, while the `cond::BaseKeyed` still is.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1692644445", "comments": 16, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1692192014", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "336a6d0a8f16154571584ff50646ad9128a336a9", "merged_at": "1692644445", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_13_3_X", "number": 42586, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "Include plugin factory name as part duplicate plugin check", "updated_at": "1692644445", "user": "makortel"}

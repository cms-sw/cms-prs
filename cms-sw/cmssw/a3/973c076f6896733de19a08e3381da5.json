I also strongly suspect but did not prove 100% that numeric_limits::max is an invalid value for this specific quanity and put that as an exception as well.  I'm running over a bunch of data to verify this (about 20k HLTPhysics events and will try to run on an EGamma file)\r\n\r\nFinally it should be noted that this code is only run if productsToWrite  = 2 which is only done for debugging when we wish to dump the values of this producer for studies. So it doesnt normally run in the HLT and I dont believe there is any workflow that runs this code. \r\n \r\nSo this should be a zero output change. As this code does not run normally and when it does run the data should always pass these checks. \r\n \r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRuns as expected on my local machine based on HLT timing data. Will run on E/gamma data later with productsToWrite=2 later.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 4, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1729670177", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["hlt-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_2_X", "number": 46488, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Removing clang warning in EgammaHLTPixelMatchVarProducer", "updated_at": "1729670402", "user": "Sam-Harper"}

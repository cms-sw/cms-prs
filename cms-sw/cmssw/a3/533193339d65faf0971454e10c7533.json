This is necessary for two reasons: (1) the Digi step of the PreMixing merge has no pileup, so there is no inefficiency, which gives too many hits from the hard-scatter MC event; (2) Killing hits separately for the premixed pileup and hard-scatter, even if this was possible, could lead to cases where pileup hits were killed for different modules than hard-scatter hits due to the randomness of the process.\nAlso fixed here is the \"circular\" dependency for pileup information, whose \"consumes\" was removed for things coming from the Secondary Input Stream.\n\nNote to selves: forthcoming \"Era\" definitions in cfg files (Pixels especially) will need to be modified to work with premixing.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 15, "closed_at": "1424809002", "comments": 15, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1424801168", "deletions": 393, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "fully-signed", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "99408a76837a9156e929884a0db079d5c208890c", "merged_at": "1424809002", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 7937, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "74 x pixel dynamic eff in pre mixing", "updated_at": "1424850547", "user": "mdhildreth"}

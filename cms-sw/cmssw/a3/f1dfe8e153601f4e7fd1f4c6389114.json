The use of DD4hep within Geant4 adds effectively one more level in the volume stack, which breaks the logic of the BTL numbering scheme as updated. For this reason an extra protection is added, to address this specific case. \r\n\r\nAt the same time also the static analyser issue https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/39670#pullrequestreview-1152996566 is addressed.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTest workflows 20834.0, 20834.911 and 23634.911 are correctly executed.

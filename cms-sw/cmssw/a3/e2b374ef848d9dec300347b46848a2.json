These PRs introduced dependency lines in the BuildFiles that were not needed by the corresponding build targets themselves, but actually these dependencies were missed in packages further up in the dependency hierarchy. I hope the few additions of `use=\"DataFormats/HepMCCandidate\"` I made at what I think are the correct places would also fix the missing package dependency needed for UBSAN?\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCMSSW compiles. It was checked that all newly added dependencies are actually required by the package with `git grep`.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 14, "closed_at": "1611738549", "comments": 12, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1611311657", "deletions": 27, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "generators-approved", "geometry-approved", "hlt-approved", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "b1cafdaf345dafef853e9d50794c111fc3bb8268", "merged_at": "1611738549", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 32714, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "Clean various BuildFiles", "updated_at": "1611738549", "user": "guitargeek"}

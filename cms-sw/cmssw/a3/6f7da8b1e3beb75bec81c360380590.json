D15 is added to the PR tests (that makes 4 tests for 2023, but only temporarily; once we have final decisions for the next TDR production, 1 or 2 of those can be removed).", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 17, "closed_at": "1493707399", "comments": 16, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1493499096", "deletions": 12, "labels": ["comparison-available", "geometry-approved", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "66c7effdf6b3fb735524fec246c3467c18555e98", "merged_at": "1493707399", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_1_X", "number": 18524, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "add D15,D16,D17 versions for 2023, reduce # of IB workflows, fix D14", "updated_at": "1493707399", "user": "kpedro88"}

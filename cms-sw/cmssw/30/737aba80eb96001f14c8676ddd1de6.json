It was returning 8001 instead of 8021. See Issue #42179 for more discussion. Note this bug was introduced in 12_3_X and this PR will need to be backported to cover active releases since then.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nAn existing unit test was extended to check the exit code after a FileReadError. In the schema evolution tests there is a file that will exhibit such an error and I used that. Otherwise, it is pretty hard to create such a file intentionally (silver lining of an unrelated 13_0_0 ROOT bug). Note that I don't intend to backport the unit test part because the schema evolution unit test it depends on is relatively new.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1702656009", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["core-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "number": 43579, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Fix bug related to cmsRun exit code with FileReadError", "updated_at": "1702656036", "user": "wddgit"}

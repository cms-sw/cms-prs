Further changes are done:\r\n- Requirements on the inner and outer track pT, |eta|, and dR are now added in the global muon requirement; \r\n- The global muon efficiency is now measured using the merged standalone collection and using the outer track parameters; \r\n- The standalone muon efficiency is measured using only tracks that are not muon seeded and a dR matching to an outer track is performed (instead of taking the reference).\r\n\r\nOnly DQMOffline/Lumi will be affected by those changes\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe code was validated using cmsDriver.py in CMSSW_12_4_12. It was also compared to a offline standalone implementation and identical results, as desired, were obtained.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nIt should get merged in time for the 2023 data taking\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 10, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1676666517", "deletions": 65, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_1_X", "number": 40815, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 5, "state": "open", "title": "Improvements on measurement methodology of ZCounting", "updated_at": "1676993337", "user": "davidwalter2"}

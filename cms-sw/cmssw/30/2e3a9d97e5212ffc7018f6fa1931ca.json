The old mva-id isn't cut on anywhere in the ged reconstruction, so it is purely there for comparison with the old electrons / cosmetics.\n\nRemoved a few hundred lines of dead code from PFEGammaAlgo.cc/.h, none of it was called so this is purely cosmetic.\n\nFixed yet another EB/EE mixing bug, fixed a bug where clusters were being double counted.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1386693589", "comments": 15, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1385980471", "deletions": 620, "labels": ["fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "014105f5df5ee89d40ce4aa50b327ee1c3f3b6ea", "merged_at": "1386693589", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_0_0_pre10", "number": 1644, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Cleanup of Old MVA assignment / kill dead code / bugfixes", "updated_at": "1386694071", "user": "lgray"}

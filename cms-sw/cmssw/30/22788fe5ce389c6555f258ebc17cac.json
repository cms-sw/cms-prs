This caused issues when trying to improve calibrations for pixel cluster (position) parameter estimation, CPE. \r\n\r\nThis fix changes the CPE algorithms by relying on the \"good\" cluster edge, instead of both edges. This alternative algorithm is only used if the clusters are shorter than expected (e.g. broken). The change affects template reconstruction, and generic reconstruction both at CPU and GPU (alpaka). The fix is gated behind process modifiers for testing. The new versions of CPE algorithms require corresponding condition updates.\r\n\r\nA report on this has been given at the [Tracker DPG meeting](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1505985/#30-report-on-proposed-changes).\r\n\r\n**PR validation:**\r\n\r\nUndergoing `runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos`. We don't expect any workflow to be affect since the changes are protected by process modifiers. The PR was opened before the validation to allower others to comment early.\r\n\r\n**Backport**\r\nTo be backported to 15.0.X: https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/48008", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 24, "comments": 100, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1745844125", "deletions": 77, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "hlt-pending", "db-pending", "operations-approved", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-approved", "heterogeneous-approved", "trk", "allow-mroguljic"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 47966, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 16, "state": "open", "title": "Adapt pixel cpe algo to better handle broken clusters", "updated_at": "1747755885", "user": "mroguljic"}

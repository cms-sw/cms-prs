It can be merged safely without impacting existing setups.\r\n\r\n#### PR Validation:\r\n\r\n    The geometry generation and GEN-SIM workflow have been tested successfully.\r\n\r\n    Results confirm that both the detector structure and simulation chain perform as expected.\r\n\r\nThis is the first PR related to the CRACK project, laying the foundation for further developments and integration work.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 198, "closed_at": "1752064841", "comments": 2, "commits": 93, "created_at": "1752060855", "deletions": 25228, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "dqm-pending", "l1-pending", "hlt-pending", "core-pending", "alca-pending", "daq-pending", "generators-pending", "geometry-pending", "operations-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-rejected", "heterogeneous-pending", "tracking", "trk", "ml-pending", "changes-dataformats"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 48516, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "From cmssw 15 0 1", "updated_at": "1752064841", "user": "hayfasfar"}

This PR adds the option to run the 1-Path-standalone jobs for only a subset M of the Paths in the menu (M < N). This can be useful when testing an update which is known to modify only M Paths, where one normally wants to run (a) the full HLT menu, and (b) standalone jobs only for the M Paths in question, given that the other N-M Paths are unchanged.\r\n>\r\n>This is implemented by adding the command-line argument `--paths` to `hltIntegrationTests`. In analogy to the `--paths` argument of `hltGetConfiguration`, one can specify patterns to select certain Paths using a comma-separated list. One can also specify Paths to be ignored/dropped by prepending the character `-` to a given pattern (e.g. `--paths \"*HLT*,-HLTriggerFinalPath\"` to ignore the Path `HLTriggerFinalPath`). The script `hltListPaths` is updated accordingly (technically, changing its CLI in a non-backward-compatible way). More details are provided in the help messages of the scripts updated in this PR.\r\n>\r\n>Note.\r\n> - `hltIntegrationTests [MENU] -x \"--paths A,B,C\"` (before and after this PR) corresponds to running 4 jobs: one with a menu containing only 3 Paths (A, B, C), plus 1-Path jobs for each of those 3 Paths (A, B, C).\r\n> - `hltIntegrationTests [MENU] --paths A,B,C` (possible only with this PR) also corresponds to running 4 jobs: one with a 'full' menu containing all its Paths (possibly many more than A, B and C), plus 1-Path jobs only for the 3 Paths specified via `--paths` (i.e. A, B and C).\r\n>\r\n>Minor code improvements are included as well.\r\n>\r\n>Merely technical.

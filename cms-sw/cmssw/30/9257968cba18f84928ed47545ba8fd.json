This type of configuration is used in offline trigger studies, even though it is untested in CMSSW.\r\n\r\nFor further details, please the description of the original PR, i.e. #40461.\r\n\r\nSmall edits are applied to other L1REPACK `cff`s, to fix a few print-outs (see https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/40461#discussion_r1065857148 for details).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nNone beyond the checks done for #40461.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

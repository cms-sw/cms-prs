This does not appear to be the case for unique_ptr.\nAt the time, this difference was not yet understood, so the problem was \"fixed\" by reverting unique_ptr to auto_ptr. However, this is unsatisfactory in the long run, because if and when the deprecated auto-ptr is changed to unique_ptr, the problem will recur. This PR converts the auto_ptr to unique_ptr and changes the code to explicitly check for the case that caused the problem.\nPR #14293 fixed the same problem in HadronizerFilter.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1462081608", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1461950077", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["comparison-available", "generators-pending", "orp-approved", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "32f1a5dd85cb583fc4fd8fc0a86ee8f33635302b", "merged_at": "1462081608", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 14308, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix use of std::unique_ptr in GeneratorFilter", "updated_at": "1464229954", "user": "wmtan"}

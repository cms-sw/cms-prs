SimHits are discarded (not considered for Digitization) when the trajectory is entirely inside the bias rail region. At the moment we consider also those SimHits for which the trajectory is partly outside (optimistic scenario with 'AND' condition for Entry/Exit points of SimHits) the bias rail region. \r\n\r\n**Note :** the code was already integrated before we are now switching it on through a configuration parameter. \r\n\r\nWe expect to find  less digis in PSP modules due to this inefficiency\r\n  \r\nAt the moment we are estimating the effect of this inefficiency in L1 tracking and it is not fully optimized. We might move to a more pessimistic scenario when we shall not consider the SimHits where the the trajectory is event partly inside the bias rail region ( 'OR' condition for Entry/Exit points of SimHits)\r\n\r\n#### PR validation and some performance updates\r\n\r\n- [Bi-weekly modelling, simulation and performance Meeting 11/11/2022](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1201190/contributions/5140217/attachments/2547129/4386516/Phase2Digitizer_BiasRailInEff_NoiseOccu_11112022.pdf)\r\n\r\n- [Bi-weekly modelling, simulation and performance Meeting 11/11/2022](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1201190/contributions/5135986/attachments/2546226/4384765/LST_BiasRailBadStrips_TKPhase2Simulation_221111.pdf)\r\n\r\n- [Bi-weekly modelling, simulation and performance Meeting 27/05/2022](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1160374/contributions/4894251/attachments/2452078/4201920/L1T_DQM_Update_5_27_22.pdf)\r\n  \r\n**Note :** all the above validation plots are presented with the pessimistic 'OR' option\r\n\r\n@emiglior ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 23, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1668510105", "deletions": 10, "labels": ["simulation-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_6_X", "number": 40069, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Phase2TrackerDigitizer: Activating Bias Rail Inefficiency", "updated_at": "1668833028", "user": "suchandradutta"}

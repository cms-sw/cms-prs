This is inconsistent with both the JetCorrectorParameters and the correctionlib implementation and can be considered a bug from my point of view.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI have included a validation of JetResolutionObject+JetCorrectorParameters against correctionlib in the context of providing JSON-format files, cf. https://github.com/kirschen/JECDatabase/blob/master/scripts/JERC2JSON/testJERCJSON.py\r\n\r\nThere are inconsistent results of the CMSSW/correctionlib evaluation at all bin edges before applying this fix, but full consistency afterward.\r\n@tankit @juska @laurenhay ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1642683502", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["db-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 36759, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Unify bin-edge handling in JetResolutionObject and JetCorrectorParameters", "updated_at": "1642683830", "user": "kirschen"}

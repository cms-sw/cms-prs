This is inconsistent with both the JetCorrectorParameters and the correctionlib implementation and can be considered a bug from my point of view.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI have included a validation of JetResolutionObject+JetCorrectorParameters against correctionlib in the context of providing JSON-format files, cf. https://github.com/kirschen/JECDatabase/blob/master/scripts/JERC2JSON/testJERCJSON.py\r\n\r\nThere are inconsistent results of the CMSSW/correctionlib evaluation at all bin edges before applying this fix, but full consistency afterward.\r\n@tankit @juska @laurenhay ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1642898154", "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1642683502", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["fully-signed", "tests-rejected", "db-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "c612bad8ce89b62888b982ce3fa4ca8917ee9838", "merged_at": "1642898154", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 36759, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Unify bin-edge handling in JetResolutionObject and JetCorrectorParameters", "updated_at": "1642898155", "user": "kirschen"}

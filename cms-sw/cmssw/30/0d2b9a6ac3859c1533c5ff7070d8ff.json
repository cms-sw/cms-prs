This requires a mapping between the stream ID of the event to the entry number in the events tree.  Without this pull request, a delayed read of a product would likely read it from the entry in the Events tree corresponding to the most recent event read, rather than the correct event. \n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 39, "closed_at": "1378913107", "comments": 8, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1378521159", "deletions": 132, "labels": ["core-approved", "dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "c8670362e6ba91e0ed1f93537c884e276f71d097", "merged_at": "1378913107", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_0_0_pre4", "number": 735, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 6, "state": "closed", "title": "Use correct stream for Delayed Reading", "updated_at": "1404666619", "user": "wmtan"}

It contains a number of classes which have been modified that the current Cascade algorithm uses in addition to new classes. The modifications and new code can be used as part of a new algorithm which will replace the Cascade algorithm. However, the current Cascade algorithm can still be used.\n\nRelevant presentations include: https://indico.cern.ch/event/297801 and https://indico.cern.ch/event/351559\n\nThe code has been updated for multithreading and updated with fillDescriptions() also.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 16, "closed_at": "1424240577", "comments": 11, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1419356227", "deletions": 1524, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "hlt-approved", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-rejected", "tests-rejected"], "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 7003, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 50, "state": "closed", "title": "L3 update", "updated_at": "1424240577", "user": "BenjaminRS"}

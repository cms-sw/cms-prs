This was leading to a DQM integrity error plot being mistakenly filled.\r\n\r\nWe have set these values so the bx labels are treated as the same in this scope and avoid incorrectly filling DQM integrity error plots.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe ECAL DQM code was run on an offending dataset and the fake integrity errors disappeared. We also confirmed the results with ECAL DAQ.\r\n\r\nBackport to CMSSW_12_0_X provided here: https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/35674\r\n\r\nSuggestion made in the backport PR here https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/35674#discussion_r730939024 was made after this PR was merged, quick fix in master done here https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/35725", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1634536118", "comments": 11, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1634137524", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "42c9ea8ae5ce2efb1d37fb5de0f26228b149f772", "merged_at": "1634536118", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "number": 35661, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Set equivalence of first/last bx labels used by different subsystems in ECAL DQM", "updated_at": "1634649448", "user": "alejands"}

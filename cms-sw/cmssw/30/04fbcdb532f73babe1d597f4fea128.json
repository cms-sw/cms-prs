This was leading to a DQM integrity error plot being mistakenly filled.\r\n\r\nWe have set these values so the bx labels are treated as the same in this scope and avoid incorrectly filling DQM integrity error plots.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe ECAL DQM code was run on an offending dataset and the fake integrity errors disappeared.

It was suggested to modify `V0EventSelector` in order to produce skimmed V0 collections based on their mass, to enhance the purity in terms of strange origin of the tracks analyzed via `StandaloneTrackMonitor`, based on the results shown [here](https://dbruschi.web.cern.ch/TrackingPOG_sorted/2024_physics_production/K0s/) and [here](https://dbruschi.web.cern.ch/TrackingPOG_sorted/2024_physics_production/Lambdas/).\r\n   * 199548dfdc867040529a6e9364abdaf9d743801a add missing `fillDescription` parameters and place early returns in case of missing input data in various plugins\r\n   * 514a64cae279aa91cfb6b836f4a57b0a0b5afd76 add `catch2` based tests for various plugins in the package\r\n\r\nThis update concerns only the Tracking Data/MC validation suite and is of no consequence on any DQM production sequence run in online or offline DQM.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRelies on the unit tests of this package: (existing) `scram b runtests_testTrackingDATAMC` and (newly added) `scram b runtests_testTrackingDQMAnalyzers`  both run fine.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

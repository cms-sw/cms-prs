This adds them in.  I'm still checking why this wasn't noticed in the checks for #11466 (switch matrix tests to eras).  I'm pretty sure it's because whenever L1 was run, L1Reco is also run which also adds them.  It's only when L1 is run without L1Reco.\n\nOnce this is submitted I'll run config diffs of with and without this change.\n\nEras in this config file are a bit messy.  After talking with some L1 experts I think it would be much better to flatten out the structure by getting rid of the cfi files in the `load` commands and applying the changes directly in SimL1Emulator_cff.  I'll leave this for another time though.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1444387698", "comments": 12, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1444362386", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["comparison-available", "l1-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "991434aecb8e40c632f6708dbe4e52262b39fe0c", "merged_at": "1444387698", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 11707, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add caloConfig and caloConfigSource to L1 step", "updated_at": "1444907732", "user": "mark-grimes"}

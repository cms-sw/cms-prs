The veto threshold is taken from the `auxi2` field of the `HcalTPChannelParameters` object for robust control of the veto threshold online and offline.\r\n\r\nSmall change in logic is incurred at L519 of HcalTrigPrimAlgo, where check_sat is now only defined by saturation in BX0 or BX1.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nThis is a backport of #44373 to target the 14_0_X release cycle.", "branch": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "changed_files": 7, "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1711540296", "deletions": 30, "labels": ["alca-approved", "l1-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "db-approved", "backport-ok"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "number": 44556, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[Backport to 14_0_X (#44337)]: Add Veto Threshold to HCAL TP Emulator", "updated_at": "1711616954", "user": "JHiltbrand"}

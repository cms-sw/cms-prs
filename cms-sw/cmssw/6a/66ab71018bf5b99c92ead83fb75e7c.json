The older producers are not thread safe and do not use the consumes features. At some point there was a push to switch to the newer producers (see [1]), but we think that some of the code was overlooked. This brings the \"new\" python files fully in sync and will be a big help to anyone who directly uses the jet correctors.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/FWMultithreadedConsumesJetCorrectorMigration\r\n\r\n@rappoccio ", "branch": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1485525129", "comments": 12, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1485183464", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "6d2bbcac38cf2c1da2a75fb5f3304c5d739b7e26", "merged_at": "1485525128", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "number": 17253, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Thread Safe Jet Correctors", "updated_at": "1485525129", "user": "aperloff"}

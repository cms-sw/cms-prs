The new plotting script fixes several issues with the final plotting currently provided by the all-in-one; however, the replacement is not done in this PR and will have to be done at a second time.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nPrivate validation was carried out using this branch and operating the new plotting macros. \r\nThe plots at this [link](http://musich.web.cern.ch/musich/display/ZmmRevised/) were obtained. For a comparison with the output of the current code, see please [here](http://musich.web.cern.ch/musich/display/ZmmRevised/control/). \r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nVerbatim backport of  #44994  to the 2024 data-taking release cycle.\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 3, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1716217795", "deletions": 18, "labels": ["alca-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "backport", "trk"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "number": 45002, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[14.0.X] Improvements for Tracker Alignment `DiMuonValidation`", "updated_at": "1716217990", "user": "mmusich"}

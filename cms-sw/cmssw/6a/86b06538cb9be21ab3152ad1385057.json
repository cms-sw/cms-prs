Currently it is correctily implemented only for L1Offset. For chains that includes CaloL1Fastjet, zsp corrections are missed and this is 20% of jet energy scale.\r\nConcerning rebase/update, I see that Configuration is completely changed. Thus, this is not a matter of rebase. I sent message to JetMET conveners and ask how to proceed.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1492952648", "comments": 56, "commits": 9, "created_at": "1490795301", "deletions": 44, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "93dc1eb92ad4ddb89a711c1919949e48fc65fb04", "merged_at": "1492952648", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_1_X", "number": 18121, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix for JPTFastjet correction chains", "updated_at": "1492952648", "user": "kodolova"}

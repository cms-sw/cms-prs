A common TMVA evaluator should help reduce the likelihood of such bugs.\nAutomatically ported from CMSSW_7_5_X #9673 (original by @cms-btv-pog).\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 15, "closed_at": "1435128095", "comments": 9, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1435042751", "deletions": 300, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "8a2782b3839405a9eb2e99d6d4f431cedf20e15d", "merged_at": "1435128095", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 9794, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Switching b-taggers to a common TMVAEvaluator class", "updated_at": "1435322752", "user": "cmsbuild"}

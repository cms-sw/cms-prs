This is the last one in geometry packages.\r\n\r\nConverted the test module CSCDetIdAnalyzer from a legacy type module to a ```one``` type module. A trivial 2 line change.\r\n\r\nNote that I migrated this one rather than deleting it, because other than being legacy it looks like the module might still work and there has been activity to maintain this module as recently as 2022. As far as I can tell, this module has always been excluded from compilation in the BuildFile. Compilation has been broken since January 2023 because it is legacy. If you would prefer I delete the module, let me know and I will gladly do that instead.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nIf I temporarily add it into the BuildFile only as a test, then it compiles successfully with the change. There are no tests to run this module and I didn't think it worth the effort to add new ones.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1706719646", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["geometry-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "number": 43829, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Migrate last geometry legacy type module", "updated_at": "1706719945", "user": "wddgit"}

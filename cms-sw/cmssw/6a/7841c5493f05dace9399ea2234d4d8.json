As such it includes:\r\n- new Standalone Muon seeding module from L1TkMuons\r\n- streamlined Tracker Muons reconstruction performing the Inside-Out pass first\r\n\r\nAs part of the integration, the `phase2L2AndL3Muons` procModifiers has been removed. The other related procModifer `phase2L3MuonsOIFirst` remains as a quick way to assess the performance of the Outside-In first approach in Tracker Muon reconstruction. The latter procModifier is also enabled by default in `.778` workflows (as before)\r\n\r\nSlight differences in timing and HLT Muons' physics performance are expected, with slightly higher Standalone performance in the barrel and slightly lower in the endcaps, as seen in the PR that implemented these changes #46897 first. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nThe PR was tested locally on the standard test suite and a few `.778` workflows, such as `29704.778`", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 15, "comments": 12, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1749045065", "deletions": 241, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "hlt-pending", "operations-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "tests-started", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-approved", "xpog-pending", "ngt"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 48246, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[NGT] Update default Phase 2 HLT Muon sequence  to use new Standalone seeding module and streamlined Tracker Muon reconstruction", "updated_at": "1749449318", "user": "Parsifal-2045"}

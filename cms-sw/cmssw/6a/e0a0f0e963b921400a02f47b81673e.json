The new rule explicitly tells ROOT about the dependencies between member data.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCompared reading a file containing a v12 version of HitPattern in both ROOT 6.12 and ROOT 6.14 versions of CMSSW_10_6. Dumped the values of the various functions of HitPattern and compared the results from both versions of ROOT. With this change, the values are identical.\r\n\r\nAdded a unit test which uses values from one of the previously failing v12 data objects.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 65, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1552836115", "deletions": 70, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "requires-external", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 26205, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 4, "state": "open", "title": "Fix v12 IO rule for HitPattern", "updated_at": "1553216466", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

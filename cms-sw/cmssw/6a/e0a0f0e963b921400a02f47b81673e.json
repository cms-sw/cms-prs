The new rule explicitly tells ROOT about the dependencies between member data.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCompared reading a file containing a v12 version of HitPattern in both ROOT 6.12 and ROOT 6.14 versions of CMSSW_10_6. Dumped the values of the various functions of HitPattern and compared the results from both versions of ROOT. With this change, the values are identical.\r\n\r\nAdded a unit test which uses values from one of the previously failing v12 data objects.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1553261639", "comments": 72, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1552836115", "deletions": 70, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "requires-external", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "13dccc09eeffc3aa18aa6b471da1f2724aab8bfa", "merged_at": "1553261639", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 26205, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 4, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix v12 IO rule for HitPattern", "updated_at": "1553339126", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

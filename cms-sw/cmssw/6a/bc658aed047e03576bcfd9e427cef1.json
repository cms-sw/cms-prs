The module `TrackerTrackHitFilter` indeed requires at construction time the following conditions:\r\n\r\n```\r\n----- Begin Fatal Exception 21-Feb-2023 12:46:22 CET-----------------------\r\nAn exception of category 'NoRecord' occurred while\r\n   [0] Processing  Event run: 1 lumi: 67 event: 6602 stream: 0\r\n   [1] Running path 'p2'\r\n   [2] Prefetching for module TrackerTrackHitFilter/'TrackerTrackHitFilter'\r\n   [3] Prefetching for EventSetup module SiStripQualityESProducer/'siStripQualityESProducer'\r\n   [4] Calling method for EventSetup module SiStripConnectivity/'sistripconn'\r\n   [5] While getting dependent Record from Record SiStripDetCablingRcd\r\nException Message:\r\nNo \"SiStripFedCablingRcd\" record found in the EventSetup.\r\n\r\n Please add an ESSource or ESProducer that delivers such a record.\r\n----- End Fatal Exception -------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\nAs it seems that adding Phase-0 SiStrip conditions (either in GT or by dedicated `ESSource`) would be a wrong design choice, the goal of this PR is allow `TrackerTrackHitFilter` to run without Phase-0 SiStrip conditions, by means of adding a new parameter `isPhase2` that governs if the `SiStripClusterInfo` object used in `TrackerTrackHitFilter` should be constructed or not with an `esConsumes` call.  \r\nThis is achieved by using `std::optional` to declare the `SiStripClusterInfo` data member and construct it only if the workflow is not meant for Phase-2.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nrun dedicated private tests.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

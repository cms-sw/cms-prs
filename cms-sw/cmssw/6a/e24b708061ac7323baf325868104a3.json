Arbitrary estimated couplings and a threshold are given as input parameters. Charges of marginal channels in a cluster are corrected wrt the couplings and the ones below the given threshold are set to zero. Clusters will be pruned if all channels of a row or column are zero and the cluster position will be recalculated.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe code has been validated using two particle gun samples of 100 GeV muons at eta 0, one with no xtalk and one with 10% xtalk between pixels of odd rows and the next row.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1565280424", "comments": 26, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1563966007", "deletions": 65, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "hold", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-approved", "upgrade-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27593, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 9, "state": "closed", "title": "Correcting Cross-Talk Effect in The Phase-2 Inner Tracker Detector", "updated_at": "1565280424", "user": "Arash-Jofrehei"}

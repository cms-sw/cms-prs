An ESProducer is run at HLT to make a reproducible choice of which payload to use. This new client is monitoring the values of the two payloads as well as plotting which one of the two is chosen by the ESProducer logic.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nI have run the DQM/Integration/python/clients/onlinebeammonitor_dqm_sourceclient-live_cfg.py with unitTest=True option.\r\nThe plots looks right.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nA backporting to 11_1_X will be prepared. It is needed for the next MWGR\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1603878447", "comments": 48, "commits": 10, "created_at": "1603367808", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "4ad329a9cbbebcc8aed8bf9f52db3fc252531e4e", "merged_at": "1603878447", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 31904, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 25, "state": "closed", "title": " added a new client to monitor the beamspot choice at HLT", "updated_at": "1603878447", "user": "gennai"}

This is not in the firmware for Run-3. We only read out the first two CLCTs/LCTs.\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested with ME2/1 B904 data from a data run two weeks ago. Results for CLCTs and LCTs look good. About 0.63% CLCTs too many in emulator for ME2/1.\r\n\r\nThere is an issue with ME2/1 CLCTs with quality == 7 in the data. First reported here:  http://cmsonline.cern.ch/cms-elog/1127545. Those CLCTs are invalid. This PR is not intended to fix that issue. But the issue persists in most recent B904 tests. It concerns 6 in ~10k CLCTs.\r\n\r\n[CSC_dataVsEmul_B904_Cosmic_Run_211105_132717.pdf](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/files/7556873/CSC_dataVsEmul_B904_Cosmic_Run_211105_132717.pdf)\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n@giovanni-mocellin @tahuang1991 ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 4, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1637168796", "deletions": 42, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_2_X", "number": 36156, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Delete obsolete calls to \"isDuplicateLCT\" in the L1T CSC DQM", "updated_at": "1637180588", "user": "dildick"}

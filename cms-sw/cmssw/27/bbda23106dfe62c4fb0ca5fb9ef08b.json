This is not in the firmware for Run-3. We only read out the first two CLCTs/LCTs.\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested with ME2/1 B904 data from a data run two weeks ago. Results for CLCTs and LCTs look good. About 0.63% CLCTs too many in emulator for ME2/1.\r\n\r\nThere is an issue with ME2/1 CLCTs with quality == 7 in the data. First reported here:  http://cmsonline.cern.ch/cms-elog/1127545. Those CLCTs are invalid. The issue persists in most recent B904 tests. It concerns 6 in ~10k CLCTs.\r\n\r\n[CSC_dataVsEmul_B904_Cosmic_Run_211105_132717.pdf](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/files/7556873/CSC_dataVsEmul_B904_Cosmic_Run_211105_132717.pdf)\r\n\r\nI also re-analyzed the data run with 115k events from this July 1st 2021 with the ME1/1 B904 test stand. I notice that the CLCT bending, slope and Run-2 pattern number do not match at all between data and emulation. In my analysis for PR https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/34417 several months ago with an older version of the unpacker I did not see this. The agreement was much better. The disagreement is not seen for LCT bending, slope and Run-2 pattern number. Perhaps it's an issue with the unpacker for ME1/1. \r\n\r\n[CSC_dataVsEmul_B904_Cosmic_Run_210701_135109.pdf](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/files/7558433/CSC_dataVsEmul_B904_Cosmic_Run_210701_135109.pdf)\r\n\r\nThis PR does not intend to fix the issues mentioned above.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n@giovanni-mocellin @tahuang1991 ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1637248896", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1637168796", "deletions": 42, "labels": ["dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "64bdd3005d6d01f5fb63fb2f76f37d11530fb554", "merged_at": "1637248895", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_2_X", "number": 36156, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Delete obsolete calls to \"isDuplicateLCT\" in the L1T CSC DQM", "updated_at": "1637248896", "user": "dildick"}

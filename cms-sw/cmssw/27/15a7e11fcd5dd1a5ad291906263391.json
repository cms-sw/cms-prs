These tau-Ids was superseded by deepTauID v2 and are not present in official workflows.\r\n\r\nIn addition two outdated and unused modules are also removed.\r\n\r\nNo changes are expected.\r\n\r\nThis PR is accompanied by another PR to cms-data removing model files of removed DNN-based tau-Ids (https://github.com/cms-data/RecoTauTag-TrainingFiles/pull/9) or its updated version https://github.com/cms-data/RecoTauTag-TrainingFiles/pull/10.\r\n\r\nThis is backport of #38063.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nLimited matrix tests successful in original PR (#38063). Not repeated here as differences between master and 12_4_X are minimal (can be done on request).\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nBackport of #38063.\r\n\r\nRemoval of outdated code and (more importantly) reduction of size of cms-distr thanks to removal of old model files when https://github.com/cms-data/RecoTauTag-TrainingFiles/pull/9 merged. Finally it enables adding to cms-distr of 12_4_X new model files of newest deepTauID v2p5 requested in https://github.com/cms-data/RecoTauTag-TrainingFiles/pull/10.", "branch": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "changed_files": 5, "comments": 20, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1654071588", "deletions": 1181, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 38164, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Remove depreciated DNN-based tau-Ids [12_4_X]", "updated_at": "1654777522", "user": "mbluj"}

For pileup this was happening in the MixingModule in stage 1 premixing and for signal in the MixingModule in stage 2 premixing. Instead, killing of transiently bad components was deferred to the last step in the DataMixer where signal and pileup digis are mixed. With this commit both permanently and transiently bad pixel components are killed in one place, in the DataMixer. This way premixed pileup library can be produced even before the list of bad components has been finalized and can later be reused (within the same production campaign) even with different bad component scenarios. The proposed change was presented in the Pixel Offline Meeting on Mar. 5, 2024 and the presentation can be found [here](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1383674/#32-possible-changes-in-simulat).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested before and after the change using wf 250202.181 to confirm that permanently dead components are killed in both cases. This is a draft PR to see whether it passes all the tests.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nBackport to CMSSW_14_0_X is foreseen.\r\n\r\n@sroychow \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1709653932", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["simulation-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 44320, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Kill both permanently and transiently bad pixel components in DataMixer", "updated_at": "1709653956", "user": "ferencek"}

It was checked that all newly added dependencies are actually required by the package with `git grep`.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 36, "closed_at": "1595949028", "comments": 16, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1595426547", "deletions": 145, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "core-approved", "db-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved", "xpog-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "6c6c9d97138332e441b891b4644b59665ee5553e", "merged_at": "1595949028", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 30873, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Clean BuildFiles in PhysicsTools and some other subsystems", "updated_at": "1595949029", "user": "guitargeek"}

Consequently, eta and phi of such candidates are reset to 0 which can lead to spurious association of these candidates to jets whose axes point in the vicinity of (eta,phi)=(0,0). To reject such spurious associations, the candidate momentum is required to be greater than 0.\r\n\r\nThis change is completely transparent to all existing b-tagging algorithms and all monitored quantities. It manifests itself only in non-default setups where Puppi candidates are set as input for b tagging.", "branch": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1489391258", "comments": 10, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1487972602", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "95d3b850d074a28d48169244ecbb4d9be2779496", "merged_at": "1489391258", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "number": 17626, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Reject 0 pt Puppi candidates in jet-track association", "updated_at": "1489567890", "user": "ferencek"}

This can cause matches to be missed. Since the IB unit tests are now run with a symbolic link to the src directory,\nthe FWCore/PythonParameterSet unit test was failing due to this issue.  This PR should fix the test.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1448361084", "comments": 14, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1447959098", "deletions": 90, "labels": ["comparison-available", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "04e0f5a87d179eba13259c1499f44886c340ed46", "merged_at": "1448361084", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 12508, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 4, "state": "closed", "title": "FileInPath must handle symbolic links properly", "updated_at": "1448399529", "user": "wmtan"}

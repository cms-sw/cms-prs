This will allow making some preliminary validation, even if also this has to be considered as a work in progress and not as a final validation suite for the full `HGCAL` reconstruction.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nUsual limited `runTheMatrix`\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 8, "closed_at": "1581085834", "comments": 15, "commits": 11, "created_at": "1580915495", "deletions": 131, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "61f6cf46c6860808d0aa16e4cd358b99eb0a8c38", "merged_at": "1581085834", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 28872, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "HGCAL Validation technical changes", "updated_at": "1581085834", "user": "rovere"}

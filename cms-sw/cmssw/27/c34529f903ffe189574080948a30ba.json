The flag lives on the high bit of the firstStrip_ private data member of the SiStripCluster.  Configurable thresholds in the sensor occupancy and strip width are used to discriminate between un- and merged candidates.  The cluster refiner is turned off as configured for this PR. \n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_3_X", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1415768935", "comments": 2, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1415764008", "deletions": 7, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_3_X", "number": 6348, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "Flag candidate merged clusters for relaxed CPE errors", "updated_at": "1416851855", "user": "wmtford"}

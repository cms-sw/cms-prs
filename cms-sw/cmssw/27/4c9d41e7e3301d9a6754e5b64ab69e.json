This completes information needed to build tau quantities based on energy fractions of its constituents. Other changes introduced by the PR are use of the energy fractions:\r\n* updates of tauID against-mu simple: usage of previously added energy fractions for charged hadrons and code reorganisation to use new tauID dataformat + fillDescription;\r\n* anti-e MVA6 and deepTauID (both using energy fractions of charged hadrons and gammas) added to the tauReco-at-MiniAOD workflow;\r\n* recently moderinised tauID against-e-in-deadECal added back to the tauReco-at-MiniAOD workflow;\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nMatrix tests (`runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos`) successful.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 9, "closed_at": "1598364539", "comments": 64, "commits": 9, "created_at": "1594115896", "deletions": 124, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved", "xpog-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "5462bd140c9ce9f527638282036664254e536d0f", "merged_at": "1598364539", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 30571, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "Updates for TauReco at miniAOD", "updated_at": "1598364539", "user": "mbluj"}

Specifically, a consuming module may get run when only one of the products has been put in place, that can lead to deference of a Ref to fail on \"missing product\".\r\n\r\nAll consuming modules call the `prefetchAsync_()`, which for `PuttableProductResolver` already creates a task to release the dependent modules (`m_waitingTasks`), and inserts that into the Worker's `WaitingTaskList` (that is released after the Worker finishes). I think we could just rely on that ~~, and therefore this PR removes the override of `putProduct()` from `PuttableProductResolver`~~. This assumption turned out to be wrong, because there is also another use case for `PuttableProductResolver`: `PuttableSourceBase` sources (and `TestProcessor`, where it is also used like for sources).\r\n\r\nAs a simple way forward to fulfill the requirements of both use cases, this PR makes `PuttableProductResolver` to directly use the `Worker`'s `WaitingTaskList` in prefetching, if a `Worker` has been associated to the `PuttableProductResolver`. If no `Worker` has been associated, the `PuttableProductResolver` assumes it is from a Source (or similar), and the product is available for any consuming module without any further waiting in the prefetching.

Specifically, a consuming module may get run when only one of the products has been put in place, that can lead to deference of a Ref to fail on \"missing product\".\r\n\r\nAll consuming modules call the `prefetchAsync_()`, which for `PuttableProductResolver` already creates a task to release the dependent modules (`m_waitingTasks`), and inserts that into the Worker's `WaitingTaskList` (that is released after the Worker finishes). I think we could just rely on that, and therefore this PR removes the override of `putProduct()` from `PuttableProductResolver`.\r\n\r\nResolves #39064 .\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe reproducer I mentioned in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/39064#issuecomment-1228755900 succeeds with this change.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 0, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1661796956", "deletions": 9, "labels": ["core-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_6_X", "number": 39245, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Release dependent modules only after the worker has finished for scheduled modules", "updated_at": "1661796982", "user": "makortel"}

This PR aims to integrate this in the release.\r\n\r\nThe plugin itself is rather simple: it's a (templated) producer that adds to the event the multiplicity value of a given EDM collection.\r\n\r\nIt is used in the current Phase-2 HLT to get the multiplicity of pixel clusters; that value, in turn, is used as PU-proxy input to the PUPPI producer in Phase-2 HLT studies (see https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/32341 for the relevant update to PUPPI).\r\n\r\nAt the moment, the only application of this is the HLT Phase-2 menu in the context of Jets/MET reconstruction, so I'm tentatively adding this plugin to `HLTrigger/JetMET`.\r\n\r\nAttn: @fwyzard @trtomei\r\n\r\nPS. If experts know of an existing CMSSW producer that already serves this same purpose, that would simplify things (and make this PR unnecessary).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nPrivate tests in the context of the HLT Phase-2 TDR (i.e. in `11_1_X`).\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nNot a backport.\r\n\r\nWill need to be backported to `11_1_X` (release for the HLT Phase-2 TDR).", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1616072769", "comments": 28, "commits": 8, "created_at": "1615994440", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["allow-missirol", "code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "hlt-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "339a37b857d78923afc915d6474336a705b1fd4e", "merged_at": "1616072769", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 33204, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 12, "state": "closed", "title": "adding MultiplicityValueProducers (HLT Phase-2 TDR)", "updated_at": "1616072770", "user": "missirol"}

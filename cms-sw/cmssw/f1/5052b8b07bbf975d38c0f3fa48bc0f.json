Description from an author of the update (@aspiezia):\r\n\r\nThe following changes have been made:\r\n* Clean the amount of DQM plots. Now only decayMode and iso efficiencies are shown for RealData/QCD; decayMode and electron discriminators efficiencies for RealElectrons/ZEE; decayMode and muon discriminators efficiencies for RealMuons/ZMM.\r\n* A summary plot showing the inclusive efficiency for all the discriminators is added.\r\n* The plots for the number of taus of each event are now correctly initizialized (before it was not the case).\r\n\r\nFYI, @swozniewski\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 13, "comments": 22, "commits": 8, "created_at": "1536933501", "deletions": 44, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_3_X", "number": 24547, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Tau offline DQM update", "updated_at": "1538030013", "user": "mbluj"}

I think that many files under\nhttps://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/tree/CMSSW_7_1_0_pre7/Configuration/Skimming/test/tier1\nneed to be modified.\n\nI am not very familiar with files in Configuration/Skimming. Is it ok for me to make the changes in Configuration/Skimming and pull requests?\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1399487983", "comments": 16, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1399064670", "deletions": 24, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "operations-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "8539edad1b891b5e78f818477a17cb64077ccf94", "merged_at": "1399487983", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_1_0_pre8", "number": 3650, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "remove tcMet from the event contents of RECO and AOD", "updated_at": "1404984964", "user": "TaiSakuma"}

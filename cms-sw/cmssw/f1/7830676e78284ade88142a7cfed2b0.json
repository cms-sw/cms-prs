Most of this was already available in CLANG IB (kudos to Giulio), but there was an issue where `Vec4F` and `Vec2D` were lowered to the same type. Most of this can be pulled out once Clang improves `vector_size` implementation.\n\nThe biggest issue is `constexpr` in the test. The test was disabled on Clang, but most likely will fail with GCC in future. C++ standard was updated and freedom to add `constexpr` to random functions in standard library were removed. Thus `constexpr double a = std::cos()` is not a valid code.\n\nhttp://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3788.html#2013\n\nBuild tested with GCC 4.9.1 and Clang pre-3.6 (65d8b4c) in DEVEL IB. \n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1421449618", "comments": 6, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1421413021", "deletions": 14, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "1de412327656749f421dd9b04e8efc9371b0d816", "merged_at": "1421449618", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 7223, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "Resolve Clang issues in DataFormats/Math", "updated_at": "1421450419", "user": "davidlt"}

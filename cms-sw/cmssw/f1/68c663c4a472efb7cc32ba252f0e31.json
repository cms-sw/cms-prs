This is necessary as part of trying to speed up HGCal digitization, where calling HepJamesRandom becomes very expensive. This achieves a factor of ~3 speed up in the RNG over HepJamesRandom.\n\nImplementation taken from:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xorshift#xorshift.2B\n\nPlease let me know if there are any unit tests or standard tests I should perform.\n\nAutomatically ported from CMSSW_8_1_X #13921 (original by @lgray).\nAutomatically ported from CMSSW_9_0_X #16649 (original by @lgray).\nPlease wait for a new IB (12 to 24H) before requesting to test this PR.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 21, "closed_at": "1493220413", "comments": 4, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1488454697", "deletions": 18, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "core-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_9_1_X", "number": 17736, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "XorShift128Plus Random Engine for RandomNumberGeneratorService", "updated_at": "1493220413", "user": "cmsbuild"}

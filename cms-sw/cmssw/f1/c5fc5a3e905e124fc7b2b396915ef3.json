The payloads whose the XML dump is more frequent are belonging to this category. For the moment, only the RunInfo condFormat class has been added. Further addition will be addressed with specific PR by the owners of the concerned CondFormats. Only a one-line change PR is required for any addition. \r\n- Smoothen the XML conversion for payload classes NOT present in the built-in library.  A single plugin library is generated locally by the command,  per payload type. Once generated, the plugin library is kept for further usage, speeding up considerably the execution of multiple command requests.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 11, "closed_at": "1503980575", "comments": 36, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1503301774", "deletions": 251, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "db-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "338287d356c36a70e2b441f0e88e34a7596b1bc0", "merged_at": "1503980575", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_3_X", "number": 20215, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "Improvements for conddb dump command", "updated_at": "1503980575", "user": "ggovi"}

This PR fixes (a), and works around (b) by re-computing the relevant iEtSums values from the other (non-iEtSum) ZDC TPs, i.e. those with $|i\\eta| = 42$ and $i\\phi \\neq 99$.\r\n>\r\n>The PR includes a few additional changes, as detailed below (see the list of commits).\r\n> - Cleanup of the `L1Trigger/L1TZDC` package, removing several files which are unused and, imho, not really useful anymore.\r\n> - Fixes for the emulation of the ZDC L1T EtSums as described above, plus renaming the `L1TZDC{Producer,Analyzer}` plugins to `L1TZDCEtSums{Producer,Analyzer}` for clarity.\r\n> - Addition of `L1TEtSumsPrinter`, a simple `EDAnalyzer` to print out the content of `l1t:EtSum` objects.\r\n> - Addition of a unit test for `L1TZDCEtSumsProducer`, including a check on the values of the emulated L1T ZDC EtSums for a few events of 2024 PbPb data.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe new unit test passes.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

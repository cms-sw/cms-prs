This is to match what is in the firmware on detector. Also, on detector the peak-finder is only run when PFA2 is enabled, which has been implemented in this modification.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nA basic technical test was performed: runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

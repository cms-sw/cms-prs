In this fix the score of the MVA ID (mvaIDMuon) is computed on the fly when producing the nanoAOD. In the current implementation this is read from the miniAOD which has a non final version of the training. With this fix we make sure the training that has been published in CMS-PAS-MUO-22-001 enters the following nanoAOD versions. Note: the WP variables (mvaIDMuon_wpTight and mvaIDMuon_wpMedium ) were computed in nanoAOD already.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nPassed basic tests in the integration build system\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nThis is a backport from PR [43976](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/43976), needed so this fix enters in NanoAODv14.\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1709643243", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1709540135", "deletions": 8, "labels": ["fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "xpog-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "f9528091604efe7b5c527b4f49993e4f3226273d", "merged_at": "1709643243", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "number": 44294, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix on mvaID for muons (backport)", "updated_at": "1709643244", "user": "cramonal"}

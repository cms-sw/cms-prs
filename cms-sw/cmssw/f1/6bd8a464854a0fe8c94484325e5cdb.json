Before this PR track 4 was saved but there was no way to link it to track 1, now it stores the Geant4 Id of track 2.\r\n\r\nThis is a follow-up of #47883 that eventually will allow us to recover the `simCluster`s that are currently discarded.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nLooked at the output files of the `SimGeneral/Debugging/python/caloParticleDebugger_cfg.py`, the only expected change is in the value returned by the method `getPrimaryOrLastStoredID()` of the simTrack. \r\n\r\nFYI @rovere @fabiocos \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 9, "comments": 7, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1758727501", "deletions": 17, "labels": ["simulation-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_0_X", "number": 48986, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Fix `idLastStoredAncestor` to point to a track parent when the full graph is not saved", "updated_at": "1758778075", "user": "AuroraPerego"}

The unit tests of the package are updated accordingly. I profit of this PR to introduce few improvements in `GeneralPurposeVertexAnalyzer`  via commit a3a73717bb77969d091d79377f8af56547cbe42e. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n`scram b runtests_Genericall` runs fine.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

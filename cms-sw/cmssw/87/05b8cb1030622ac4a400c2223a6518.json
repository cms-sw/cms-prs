This causes segmentation violation when calling JetResolutionObject::getRecord(). As not seen in XML dump, the formula is obtained through the formula string. Later found that Definition::nBins() is actually check from the bin-name strings. This PR changes Definition::nVariables() accordingly. Also make new function overloading on createVector to access through name strings. Minimum changes to get around the crashes.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested locally with getPayLoadData.py on modified PI to make sure no seg. fault. Python binding parts are not touched.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nNot a backport and no backport is expected.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 2, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1688632844", "deletions": 7, "labels": ["db-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_2_X", "number": 42199, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "open", "title": "Fixing crash when accessing JetResolutionObject in CondDB", "updated_at": "1688722298", "user": "yuanchao"}

It also unifies the prefix and rules of protocols by converting the prefix to a rule. Therefore, codes handling prefix and rules are the same.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 53, "closed_at": "1691606040", "comments": 3, "commits": 35, "created_at": "1691605912", "deletions": 227, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "dqm-pending", "hlt-pending", "core-pending", "alca-pending", "db-pending", "generators-pending", "operations-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-approved", "heterogeneous-pending", "tracking", "trk"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_3_X", "number": 42529, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix chaining in rules and unify prefix and rules of protocols", "updated_at": "1691607333", "user": "nhduongvn"}

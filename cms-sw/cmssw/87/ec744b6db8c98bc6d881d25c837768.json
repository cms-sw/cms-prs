As before, this has to be corrected back at the analysis level.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1516872767", "deletions": 10, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-started", "upgrade-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_1_X", "number": 21957, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "update parameters for HGC timing to TDR inputs", "updated_at": "1516892218", "user": "amartelli"}

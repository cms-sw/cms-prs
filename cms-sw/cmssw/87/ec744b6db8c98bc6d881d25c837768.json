As before, this has to be corrected back at the analysis level.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1517952581", "comments": 17, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1516872767", "deletions": 10, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "cb12b1e5fb66f1343de311a25346ea9ed2a3173b", "merged_at": "1517952581", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_1_X", "number": 21957, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "update parameters for HGC timing to TDR inputs", "updated_at": "1517952581", "user": "amartelli"}

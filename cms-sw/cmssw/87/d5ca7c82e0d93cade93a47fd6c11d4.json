These classes are incompatible with new Geant4 10.6, because original authors overwrite too many virtual methods of classes. This broke  GEANT4 IB (https://cmssdt.cern.ch/SDT/cgi-bin/buildlogs/slc7_amd64_gcc820/CMSSW_11_1_GEANT4_X_2020-01-27-1100/SimG4Core/CustomPhysics). The reason: only public methods of Geant4 classes are stable between versions 10.0 and 10.6, private and protected method signatures potentially may be changed. \r\n\r\nThis PR includes general clean-up, which means removal all unnecessary things. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": "1580371232", "comments": 34, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1580236123", "deletions": 1190, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "a4239e576becc9c78cd8f0f763ec9d091429a428", "merged_at": "1580371232", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 28814, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Clean-up SIMP particles simulation", "updated_at": "1580371232", "user": "civanch"}

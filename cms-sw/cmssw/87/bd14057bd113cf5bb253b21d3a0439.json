Test files have been added to cms-data in these two PRs:\r\n* https://github.com/cms-data/DataFormats-L1Scouting/pull/2\r\n* https://github.com/cms-data/DataFormats-L1ScoutingRawData/pull/2\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I've taken the opportunity to introduce minor changes in other modules, most notably:\r\n* Using an approximate value for the phi LSB of caloL2 trigger objects to match the current usage by caloL2 trigger emulator.\r\n* New set of ScoutingDataSourceIDs for TCP/IP-based readout of calo primitives. Calo Unpacker  will be reformated in a future PR.\r\n* Fixing a bug in `OrbitCollection` data format\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nValidated files produced with this new version files against a set of reference data.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 10, "comments": 2, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1708014496", "deletions": 58, "labels": ["daq-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 43984, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Update L1Scouting Data Format tests and minor code fixes ", "updated_at": "1708015406", "user": "Mmiglio"}

Null taus are jets seeding tau candidates, which actually do not fulfil any good tau reconstruction criterion. In the past these had been kept in the reconstruction for debugging purposes, since it allows a 1:1 correspondence of reconstructed tau candidates with seeding jets. In the meantime this should be switched to False when running in standard reconstruction. For more details refer to @mbluj. \r\n\r\nNB: \r\nwe have split this change off from https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/17620 for clarity reasons. See also discussion in the conversation there.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nRoger \nAutomatically ported from CMSSW_9_0_X #17643 (original by @cms-tau-pog).\nPlease wait for a new IB (12 to 24H) before requesting to test this PR.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 22, "closed_at": "1488870713", "comments": 9, "commits": 8, "created_at": "1488454215", "deletions": 96, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-rejected", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_9_1_X", "number": 17706, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Switching off reconstruction of so called \"NullTaus\"", "updated_at": "1510909333", "user": "cmsbuild"}

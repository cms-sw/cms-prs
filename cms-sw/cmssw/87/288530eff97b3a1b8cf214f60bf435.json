It does not replace TICL v4 in release yet.\r\nIt features:\r\n\r\n- A `MultiVectorManager` to handle transparently more collections of the same type as if it was only one. This is very useful when consuming the results coming from more iterations or linking algorithms\r\n- Move HGCAL time to local time.\r\n- Improved TICLCandidate reconstruction and treatment of timing information from MTD, hence improving the matching with tracks.\r\n- Created a process modifier for `ticl_v5` that replaces `ticl_v3`\r\n- Split CLUE3D parameters in different areas of the detector\r\n- Tuning of CLUE3D parameters\r\n- Introduced plug-in system for trackster-trackster linking\r\n- Introduced new skeletons trackster-trackster linking algorithm\r\n- Introduced FastJet trackster-trackster linking\r\n- Introduced Passthrough trackster-trackster linking\r\n- Introduced MTD information SoA\r\n- Introduced local time in MC truth information for SimTracksters and SimTICLCandidate\r\n- Introduced TICL Graph for holding connections between tracksters needed for upcoming GNN and Leiden algorithms\r\n- Removed CLUE3DLow step\r\n- Removed TICL v3.\r\n- Removed Multiclusters\r\n\r\nMore info at https://indico.cern.ch/event/1394609/#8-hgcal\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nExecuted several phase 2 workflows with and without the process modifier and verified the TICL validation.\r\n\r\nPreliminary performance plots coming soon. \r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 105, "comments": 0, "commits": 63, "created_at": "1713532003", "deletions": 609, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "dqm-pending", "hlt-pending", "operations-pending", "visualization-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-pending", "tracking"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 44785, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "first release of TICLv5", "updated_at": "1713532050", "user": "felicepantaleo"}

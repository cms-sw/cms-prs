As L1T brings a partial L1 emulation in the DQM sequence, the two collide and gives a Schedule configuration exception. \r\n\r\nAs 1) PdmV claims that this workflow was used for a limited period in Summer 2016 and never asked fo production after that, and 2) L1T experts do not see any utility in it, I propose to simply remove it. \r\n\r\nFurther expansion of use of the L1 emulator for DQM should anyway drive IMO to consider adding the L1 item in the RECO+DQM step, to transparently manage the L1 emulation without ad hoc addition of pieces.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1538744422", "comments": 16, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1538636609", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "pdmv-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "1d2359216f23374b48313d5ec51d38ae6f769717", "merged_at": "1538744422", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_3_X", "number": 24799, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Remove workflow 136.7321 ", "updated_at": "1539001518", "user": "fabiocos"}

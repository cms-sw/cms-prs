All existing conversion code has not been changed. Just configuration files have been modified/added so to clone the necessary modules. Minor changes in DataFormats/EgammaCandidates/interface/Conversion.h and DataFormats/EgammaTrackReco/interface/ConversionTrack.h were required to include the provenance of the new collection and the associate tracks. This PR contains only the changes related to conversions and supersedes PR 25497. It depends on PR 25455 and the externals required by that. \r\n\r\nThis PR include changes in the following files: \r\nmodified:   Configuration/StandardSequences/python/Reconstruction_cff.py\r\n\tmodified:   DataFormats/EgammaCandidates/interface/Conversion.h\r\n\tmodified:   DataFormats/EgammaTrackReco/interface/ConversionTrack.h\r\n\tmodified:   DataFormats/EgammaTrackReco/src/classes_def.xml\r\n\tmodified:   RecoEgamma/Configuration/python/RecoEgamma_EventContent_cff.py\r\n\tmodified:   RecoEgamma/Configuration/python/RecoEgamma_cff.py\r\n\tmodified:   RecoEgamma/EgammaPhotonProducers/interface/ConversionProducer.h\r\n\tmodified:   RecoEgamma/EgammaPhotonProducers/interface/ConversionTrackProducer.h\r\n\tmodified:   RecoEgamma/EgammaPhotonProducers/python/allConversions_cfi.py\r\n\tnew file:   RecoEgamma/EgammaPhotonProducers/python/conversionOpenTrackSequence_cff.py\r\n\tmodified:   RecoEgamma/EgammaPhotonProducers/python/conversionTrackProducer_cfi.py\r\n\tmodified:   RecoEgamma/EgammaPhotonProducers/python/conversionTrackSequence_cff.py\r\n\tnew file:   RecoEgamma/EgammaPhotonProducers/python/gsfTracksOpenConversionSequence_cff.py\r\n\tmodified:   RecoEgamma/EgammaPhotonProducers/src/ConversionProducer.cc\r\n\tmodified:   RecoEgamma/EgammaPhotonProducers/src/ConversionTrackProducer.cc\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 15, "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1546875796", "deletions": 54, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_5_X", "number": 25595, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Conversions from low pt ele tracks released in PR 25455", "updated_at": "1546876321", "user": "nancymarinelli"}

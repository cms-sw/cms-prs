The Run-3 CSC local trigger will be notably different than then Run-1/2 trigger. CSC stubs will have a higher resolution in position (x2 to x4) and bending (x3). This is achieved by implementing a 12-bit comparator code data word (CCLUT algorithm). It is set by default to -1 for Run-1/2 CLCTs. For Run-3 it takes a value between 0 and 2^12 - 1. The halfstrip number of CLCT and LCT is given 2 extra bits, one for the 1/4 strip value and one for the 1/8 strip value. In addition, I added a new `ComparatorContainer` object to keep track of which comparators were used to build a CLCT. \r\n\r\nThis PR is a follow-up of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/28846. But the code is written such that the original functions retain their original meaning for the default arguments. The actual CCLUT algorithm will be implemented in a separate PR.\r\n\r\nMore information can be found here: \r\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/881406/contributions/3713334/attachments/1973349/3283422/CSC_NewPatterns_SD_20200121.pdf\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested with WF 22034.0.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n@barvic @tahuang1991 @ptcox \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1584390055", "comments": 16, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1584191124", "deletions": 39, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "1672da37d318255933e7a83f96856b437367100a", "merged_at": "1584390055", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 29205, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Run-3 CLCT and LCT data formats (CCLUT-3)", "updated_at": "1586530951", "user": "dildick"}

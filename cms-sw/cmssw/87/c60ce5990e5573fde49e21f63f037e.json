There is a mix of TrackerGeometry and TrackingGeometry (esp in Egamma) that I don't fully understand the logic of as there is presumably only one relevant derived type from TrackingGeometry (which is TrackerGeometry) for anything that is not a muon algorithm\r\n\r\nThis is a minimal change - I didn't attempt a cleanup in RecoEgamma.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 10, "closed_at": "1597978429", "comments": 12, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1597938039", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "hlt-approved", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "dfbb4ddab392670dd77cf3de300e0a0ec777a845", "merged_at": "1597978428", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 31196, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "change return type of geomTracker to derived class (TrackerGeometry vs TrackingGeometry)", "updated_at": "1597978429", "user": "davidlange6"}

I have added some command-line options to it using `argparse` (see `--help` for more info). Some examples below.\r\n>   ```bash\r\n>   hltPrintMenuVersions /dev/CMSSW_13_2_0/Fake2 -c 'cms_hlt_v3_r/convertMe!@cmsr'\r\n>   hltPrintMenuVersions /dev/CMSSW_13_2_0/Fake2 --db run3                        \r\n>   hltPrintMenuVersions /dev/CMSSW_10_0_0/Fake2 --db run2\r\n>   hltPrintMenuVersions /cdaq/special/PilotBeamTest2021/Circulating --db adg                        \r\n>   ```\r\n>\r\n> - Upon the release of a new HLT menu for data-taking (or MC production), TSG produces a spreadsheet which contains information on the content of the menu. The tools used to create this spreadsheet are added in this PR to `HLTrigger/Configuration/scripts/utils` (see the readme file in `scripts/utils` for further details).\r\n>\r\n>Unit tests for `hltPrintMenuVersions` and `hltMenuContentToCSVs` are included. (These new tests rely on connecting to ConfDB, so I fear they might occasionally fail due to connection glitches, based on what I remember from https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/37598#issuecomment-1326628334.)\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe new unit tests pass.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

E.g.:\r\nhttp://uaf-10.t2.ucsd.edu/~mmasciov/MIC/rescaleError100/MTV_TTbarPU50_rescaleError100_defaultIters_mkFitOnly/plots_highPurity/effandfakePtEtaPhi.pdf\r\n\r\nSimilarly to CKF tracks, a few % bias in track pT is introduced, due to a known feature related the description of the detector material in endcaps. E.g.:\r\nhttp://uaf-10.t2.ucsd.edu/~mmasciov/MIC/rescaleError100/MTV_TTbarPU50_rescaleError100_defaultIters_vsCKF/plots_highPurity/residualPt.pdf\r\n\r\nRelaxing the selection of overlap hits allows to increase the track hit multiplicity, with a reduction of fake tracks:\r\nhttp://uaf-10.t2.ucsd.edu/~mmasciov/MIC/rescaleError100/MTV_TTbarPU50_rescaleError100_extractedGeoms_overlapHitCuts_mkFitOnly/\r\n\r\nFor more details, please refer to presentations at TRK POG:\r\n(1) https://indico.cern.ch/event/1133724/#4-mkfit-status-report\r\n(2) https://indico.cern.ch/event/1142469/#5-mkfit-status-report\r\n\r\nFYI @mmusich @vmariani ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1650874630", "comments": 11, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1650024357", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "requires-external", "code-checks-approved", "tracking"], "merge_commit_sha": "2c3a99b7f7c15a542501fda60e3a4d605aab2de2", "merged_at": "1650874630", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 37580, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "MkFit TrackCandidate error rescale + relaxed selection for overlap hits", "updated_at": "1650874630", "user": "mmasciov"}

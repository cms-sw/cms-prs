E.g.:\r\nhttp://uaf-10.t2.ucsd.edu/~mmasciov/MIC/rescaleError100/MTV_TTbarPU50_rescaleError100_defaultIters_mkFitOnly/plots_highPurity/effandfakePtEtaPhi.pdf\r\n\r\nSimilarly to CKF tracks, a few % bias in track pT is introduced, due to a known feature related the description of the detector material in endcaps.

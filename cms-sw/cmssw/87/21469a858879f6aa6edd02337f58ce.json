This caused a crash under fully optimized clang because the compiler is allowed to assume that references do not point to 'null' memory. This allowed the clang compiler to remove the check for null in the dynamic_cast call.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1547231532", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_5_X", "number": 25629, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Fix incorrect address usage in VirtualJetProducer", "updated_at": "1547232089", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

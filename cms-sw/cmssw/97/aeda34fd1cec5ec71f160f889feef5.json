The latest menu for the webpage including RelVal campaigns and updated geometry section. \r\n2. The `html.py` script with a tweak in the name of a RelVal sample. \r\n3. The main validation script `hgcalPerformanceValidation.py` with a directory creation to make our life easier in the material budget study. \r\n4. The config script used for the material budget study including all detectors from vertex up to in front of muon stations. \r\n5. The `plot_hgcal_utils.py` script, since with the removal of the CALOECTSMiddle Volume, the CALOECTSFront contains now the EndcapTimingLayer, the Neutron Moderator and the Thermal Screen, which we wish to split. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nWe have used these scripts to perform the `12_1_0_pre2_Phase2_D76` campaign validation and the HGCAL V16 material budget study. \r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nThis is not a backport. \r\n\r\n@rovere @felicepantaleo @lecriste @ebrondol ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 3, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1631439022", "deletions": 38, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "geometry-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "number": 35239, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[HGCAL] Updates on validation scripts ", "updated_at": "1631512590", "user": "apsallid"}

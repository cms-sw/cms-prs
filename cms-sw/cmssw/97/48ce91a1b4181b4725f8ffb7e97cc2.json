This PR proposes a fix for it.\n\nAs not all PFCandidates have reference to a Track, `mappingTk` contains -1 elements, and accessing `reverseOrder` with `-1` gives junk (fortunately a large number in practice) that is then inserted to `mappingTk`. The edm::Association then throws an exception when such an element is accessed.\n\nTested in CMSSW_7_5_X_2015-06-06-2300 with wf 11325. I guess there are no visible effects as otherwise this would have been found already (and the associations are also not stored within MiniAOD, right?).\n\n@gpetruc @arizzi \n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1434434499", "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1434020766", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 9564, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix in Track-to-PackedCandidate association", "updated_at": "1434434499", "user": "makortel"}

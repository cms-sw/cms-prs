Now the module caches the PSet ID and gets the PSet\r\nfrom the Registry when needed and passes the PSet to the helpers\r\nwhen they need it.\r\n\r\nThe helpers also had virtual functions even though no other classes\r\ninherited from them. These were de-virtualized.\r\n\r\nTrackAnalyzer was not a unique name (a module with the same name\r\nexists) so the class was moved to the dqm namespace.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": "1496293057", "comments": 24, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1496147741", "deletions": 421, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "20842c51ebb9e74dd3c1b394548d6ea4b241e55e", "merged_at": "1496293057", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_2_X", "number": 19016, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Avoid making three copies of a large PSet in TrackingMonitor", "updated_at": "1497527243", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

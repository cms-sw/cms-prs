This is meant to fix several HLT crashes seen online in April 2023.\r\n\r\n#41470 amends a mistake introduced in #40655. The check on `size == 0` should not have been removed in #40655, mainly because, if `BXVector::size() == 0`, the call to `BXVector::isEmpty(0)` might lead to a crash (which is arguably a limit of the implementation of [`BXVector::isEmpty(int bx)`](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/0d6218db24f97d34933bda623816949d340262ba/DataFormats/L1Trigger/interface/BXVector.icc#L213)).\r\n\r\nDiscussed in #41475.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nNone beyond what was done for the integration of those PRs.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

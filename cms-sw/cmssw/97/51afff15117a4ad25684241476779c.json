Changes are observed for low-pT muon triggers, especially the Bs->mumu trigger HLT_DoubleMu4_3_Bs_v14, which goes from ~15 to ~22 Hz. We observe that the HLT efficiency for Bs->mumu candidates passing the analysis selection improves from ~75% to ~90%, so a good deal of the rate increase is coming from genuine Bs that BPH needs for analysis. \r\n\r\nFull rate results are here: https://jschulte.web.cern.ch/jschulte/rates/ \r\n\r\nfyi @missirol @khaosmos93 \r\n ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 24, "comments": 53, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1646765760", "deletions": 185, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "l1-pending", "hlt-pending", "analysis-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 37180, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 134, "state": "open", "title": "Refactore PropagateToMuon and add propagation to L3 muon filters at HLT", "updated_at": "1647876867", "user": "JanFSchulte"}

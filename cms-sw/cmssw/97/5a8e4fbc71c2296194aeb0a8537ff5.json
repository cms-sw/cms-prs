It will combine at most 8 adjacent ME0 pads into a cluster (ME0PadDigiCluster). Clusters will be sent to a CTP7 (which actually handles 3 ME0 super chambers). The CTP7 declusterizes them into single pads to be used as inputs for the ME0 pattern finding. This will be done in the ME0Motherboard in simulation.\r\n\r\nUnlike GEM, ME0PadDigiCluster will not be sent to the track-finder directly nor to the nearby CSC optical trigger motherboard. ME0TriggerDigis will only be sent to the track-finder. \r\n\r\nI also added the field \"partition\" to the ME0TriggerDigi dataformat. From the single pads in each layer it will be possible to the partition in the 3rd layer (which is likely going to be reference layer).\r\n\r\nMore information on the ME0 trigger system can be found here: https://indico.cern.ch/event/640240/contributions/2605361/attachments/1476748/2288198/MuonEndcap_SvenDildick_HLLHC_Trigger_Upgrade_20170614.pdf, slides 12-19\r\n\r\n@calabria FYI", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 72, "closed_at": "1498156247", "comments": 34, "commits": 14, "created_at": "1497543428", "deletions": 250, "labels": ["comparison-available", "l1-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-approved", "upgrade-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "01b8d5b090eca3a5f92ac5ead4084ea9a6cf768d", "merged_at": "1498156247", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_2_X", "number": 19254, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 11, "state": "closed", "title": "New feature in ME0 simulation: ME0PadDigiCluster", "updated_at": "1498480320", "user": "dildick"}

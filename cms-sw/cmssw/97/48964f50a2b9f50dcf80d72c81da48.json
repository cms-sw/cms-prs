All the code touched or written is done with main goal not to impact/conflict at all with the user from Tracker or others that will need to perform a material budget study. Detailed description of changes following the current \r\nstyle of the whole package: \r\n**1.** Added two files to declare/define HGCal materials. \r\n\r\nValidation/Geometry/data/hgcalMaterials.l0\r\nValidation/Geometry/data/hgcalMaterials.x0\r\n\r\n**2.** Added two files for the HGCal histos that will be produced. \r\n\r\nValidation/Geometry/interface/MaterialBudgetHGCalHistos.h\r\nValidation/Geometry/src/MaterialBudgetHGCalHistos.cc\r\n\r\n**3.** Added HGCal option\r\n\r\nValidation/Geometry/interface/MaterialBudgetAction.h\r\nValidation/Geometry/src/MaterialBudgetAction.cc\r\n\r\n**4.** Added HGCal map of materials alongside the tracker one. \r\n\r\nValidation/Geometry/interface/MaterialBudgetCategorizer.h\r\nValidation/Geometry/src/MaterialBudgetCategorizer.cc\r\n\r\n**5.** Added the reading of HGCal data. \r\n\r\nValidation/Geometry/interface/MaterialBudgetData.h\r\nValidation/Geometry/src/MaterialBudgetData.cc\r\n\r\n**6.** Plotting tools for all HGCal material analysis plots that are not in the \r\nusual plot_utils.py or MaterialBudget.py .  Whatever is needed and it is \r\nalready in the repository is imported in order to avoid code duplication. \r\n\r\nValidation/Geometry/python/plot_hgcal_utils.py\r\nValidation/Geometry/test/MaterialBudgetHGCal.py\r\n\r\n**7.** Added the main script of running the code: \r\n\r\nValidation/Geometry/test/runP_HGCal_cfg.py\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 13, "comments": 3, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1531218385", "deletions": 48, "labels": ["code-checks-pending", "comparison-pending", "dqm-pending", "geometry-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 23770, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "HGCal material budget analysis", "updated_at": "1531220792", "user": "apsallid"}

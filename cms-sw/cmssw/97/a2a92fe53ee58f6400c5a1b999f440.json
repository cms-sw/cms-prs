This generates a data file containing a ```std::vector<DetId>```  object with known content. Then it reads it. It verifies that when we read it we obtain values that match the known written values for all the data fields in the object. In particular all containers have content so all contained types are also read.\r\n\r\nIt also reads the old files in the DataFormats/DetId data repository which are listed in the shell script. The plan is that each time the data format of ```std::vector<DetId>``` is modified a file will added.\r\n\r\nNote that this is the last PR in a series of PRs implementing unit tests for RAW data formats.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis only adds a unit test in DataFormats/DetId which passes. It shouldn't affect anything else.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 7, "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1695747442", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["simulation-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_3_X", "number": 42877, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Add unit test for std::vector<DetId> raw data format", "updated_at": "1695914178", "user": "wddgit"}

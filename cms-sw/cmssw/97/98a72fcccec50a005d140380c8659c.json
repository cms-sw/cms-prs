Only the ROOT 5 branch unit test is broken,\nbut I'm adding it to the ROOT 5 and ROOT 6 branches\nfor consistency.\n\nThe dictionary loading in AutoLibraryLoader::enable()\nis required in ROOT 5 and not needed in ROOT 6 (that\npart actually does nothing in ROOT 6 so AutoLibraryLoader\nshould probably be renamed). The enable() function\ndoes other things, but those are not needed in this\ntest. The Ref's are function anyway because of the\nGetterOperate mechanism in FWLite that is provided\nwhen using the Event and related classes (but would\nnot be in bare ROOT mode). This unit test is really a\nfully compiled executable and not a macro so the\nheader finding parts of enable() are not needed either.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1428495422", "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1428429615", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["comparison-available", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "tests-rejected"], "merge_commit_sha": "0e3731e022517f80cb20a571e9754ff59510795a", "merged_at": "1428495422", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 8675, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix unit test", "updated_at": "1435259115", "user": "wddgit"}

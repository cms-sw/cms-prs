In order to load the 'extra' ESProducers only when appropriate, calls to `makeProcessModifier` are used in the `cfi` files to remove the modules from the `cms.Process` when the relevant modifiers are not enabled.\r\n\r\nMerely technical. No changes expected (in terms of physics results).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nA few selected wfs of `runTheMatrix.py` passed.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

An analyzer is added to Validation/RecoMuon/src, very similar to the one for standard muons. Also the necessary configuration files are added, and the sequences included in the global configuration. \r\nValidation for standard muon collection is left unchanged.\r\n\r\nSee presentation on MUO POG General meeting: [https://indico.cern.ch/event/1389920/#2-displaced-muon-in-the-valida](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1389920/#2-displaced-muon-in-the-valida)\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nNew offline DQM has been run on a real validation sample: workflow 12524.0 DisplacedSUSY with 5000 events.\r\nThe code runs smoothly and the new validation folder Muons/RecoDisplacedMuonV is in the DQM file with the correct plots. As an example, see Dxy plot of reco tracks for dSA [1] and dGl [2].\r\n\r\n[1] \r\n![Screenshot from 2024-03-08 09-31-05](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/assets/68101581/3aae02ea-77df-49a7-98dd-31114497486d)\r\n[2]\r\n![Screenshot from 2024-03-08 09-31-47](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/assets/68101581/e61d8cb3-c363-47f7-9027-49f10b3d407a)\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

At the least, I need to move the file in the data directory out of that directory. I went ahead and submitted this way because I wanted some feedback before requesting it be added to the proper data area.\r\n\r\nAdd a new unit test for the TriggerResults data format. This generates a data file containing a TriggerResults object with known content. Then it reads it. It verifies that when we read it we obtain values that match the known written values for all the data fields in the object. In particular all containers have content so all contained types are also read.\r\n\r\nIt also reads old data files in the DataFormats/Common data area. The plan is that each time the data format of TriggerResults is modified a new file will added to that area. The file names must have the format oldTestTriggerResults*.root where * is a wildcard matching anything. For example, we might use oldTestTriggerResults_13_1_X.root\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis only adds a unit test in DataFormats/Common which passes. It shouldn't affect anything else.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 7, "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1682347615", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["core-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_1_X", "number": 41395, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "open", "title": "Add unit test for TriggerResults format", "updated_at": "1682451690", "user": "wddgit"}

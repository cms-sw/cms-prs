This generates a data file containing a TriggerResults object with known content. Then it reads it. It verifies that when we read it we obtain values that match the known written values for all the data fields in the object. In particular all containers have content so all contained types are also read.\r\n\r\nIt also reads the old files in the DataFormats/Common data repository which are listed in the shell script. The plan is that each time the data format of TriggerResults is modified a file will added.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis only adds a unit test in DataFormats/Common which passes. It shouldn't affect anything else.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 7, "comments": 14, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1682347615", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["core-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "requires-external", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_1_X", "number": 41395, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "open", "title": "Add unit test for TriggerResults format", "updated_at": "1682452847", "user": "wddgit"}

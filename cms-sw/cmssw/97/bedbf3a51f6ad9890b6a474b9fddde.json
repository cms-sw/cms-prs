Allows matching with stage 2 L1 muon candidates\n2. Implements a \"by quality\" sorting logic in the matching code\n3. Adds further output that simplifies the computation of results for trigger efficiency and SFs,  given the issues described in [[1](https://indico.cern.ch/event/560227/contributions/2283979/attachments/1327133/1992714/2016_08_25_EMTF_WGM.pdf),[2](https://indico.cern.ch/event/568217/contributions/2296959/attachments/1333069/2004449/TnP_Trigger_SWunsch_07092016.pdf)]\n\nthe main user of the updated classes is Muon POG tag and probe.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": "1479108464", "comments": 8, "commits": 19, "created_at": "1475128376", "deletions": 69, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "828bc108516653dba45f6ddd4dc6f9b4cbd88cd2", "merged_at": "1479108464", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 16029, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add stage2 L1 trigger matching + features 80X", "updated_at": "1479108464", "user": "battibass"}

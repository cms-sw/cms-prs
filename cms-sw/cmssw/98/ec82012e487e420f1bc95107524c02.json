Since the  decay is not implemented in Pythia, an external generator must be used.\r\nThis PR introduces a custom plugin that forces a particle (used here for the ) to decay using kinematic information read from an external ROOT file. The decay is generated in the particles center-of-mass frame by an external event generator (in this case, Pluto).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nI successfully compiled the code in CMSSW_14_0_19 without any issues and privately produced a small MC sample for validation.\r\n\r\nBackport of #50156 to CMSSW_14_0_X\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 4, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1771248536", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "new-package-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "number": 50152, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Add custom plugin to force particle decays using products defined in an external file", "updated_at": "1771262033", "user": "Ma128-bit"}

The changes adding the full5x5 variables to the pat::Electron AND photon classes were nevertheless intentionally kept out of 71x, resulting in these variables being nowhere accessible for photons in 72x MiniAOD.  (Well they could be recomputed from the rechits, but this is a nasty regression compared to 70x from an end user point of view.)\n\n@lgray @arizzi @gpetruc \n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_2_X", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1413973698", "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1413880705", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "cf4902a3b353bc89b26713433ab80d0d6028e78f", "merged_at": "1413973698", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_2_X", "number": 5906, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "add full5x5 shower variables to reco::Photon", "updated_at": "1413973698", "user": "bendavid"}

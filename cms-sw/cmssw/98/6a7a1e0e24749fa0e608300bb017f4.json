Nothing uses this file in CMSSW. It hasn't been edited other than things like code-format since 2013.\r\n\r\nThis file was noticed because it caused PR #40427 to fail PR testing, the header checks. It uses deprecated EventSetup functions removed by that PR. Note those functions were modified to always throw an exception about 1 year ago. Anything using this file that exists outside of the CMSSW repository would have been broken then.\r\n\r\nThe alternative to deleting this file would be to modify it to use the EventSetup functions that use a token. It appears to be unlikely this is worth the developer time to implement as this appears to be dead code. Also note that the file would remain in the git history and could be restored if it is ever needed.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nNo validation necessary. This only deletes an unused header.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1672933594", "deletions": 96, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "number": 40431, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Removed unused file", "updated_at": "1672933908", "user": "wddgit"}

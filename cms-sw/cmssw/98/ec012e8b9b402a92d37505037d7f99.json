In miniAOD, association is accessible via `associatedPackedPFCandidates()` of a pat electron/photon (e.g. [here](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/4883b2eac701c829419f974811c1cd2f6550bd56/DataFormats/PatCandidates/interface/Photon.h#L314)), the AOD-2-miniAOD process transfers the association between objects.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the transfer does not work correctly for 2018 PbPb data, i.e. `run2_miniAOD_pp_on_AA_103X` process. This is understood as packedPFcandidates in this workflow is made from an intermediate, \"cleaned\" PF collection (introduced via [PR](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/31668)) and while references in `particleBasedIsolation` are still the ones from original PF collection. The `associatedPackedPFCandidates` collection created in current workflow is not correct.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the problem by producing a map between original (old) and the cleaned (new) PF candidate references and updating the references in `particleBasedIsolation` from old to new ones.\r\n\r\n**Validation**\r\nTests pass wf 140.5611 and give correct output.\r\n\r\n@mandrenguyen", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 13, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1647531006", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-rejected"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 37262, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 4, "state": "open", "title": "Associated PF for Egamma in 2018 PbPb miniAOD", "updated_at": "1648651819", "user": "ttrk"}

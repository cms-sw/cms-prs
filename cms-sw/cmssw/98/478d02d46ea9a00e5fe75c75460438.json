This is done using utility classes in `EventFilter/Utilities`, which have been enhanced for this scope.\r\n* The DQM module `DQMProvInfo` (run by central online DQM) retrieves the BST data format. From this information, the Physics Declared bit is computed, and added into the report summary profile.\r\n* A `MonitorElement` in `DQMEventInfo` is now able to show the HLT path selection in the DQM input source `DQMStreamerReader`.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 17, "closed_at": "1492088804", "comments": 34, "commits": 15, "created_at": "1490705507", "deletions": 428, "labels": ["comparison-available", "daq-pending", "dqm-pending", "l1-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "b767924e38a6b75340e6e120ece95b648bd11d2d", "merged_at": "1492088804", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_1_X", "number": 18108, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 11, "state": "closed", "title": "Add a new Data Format for BST record from TCDS raw, and use it to revive beam information, physics declared bit, and HLT event selection for online DQM", "updated_at": "1492088804", "user": "diguida"}

Added elements are the 6 fine grain bits occupancy readout at uHTR/layer1 and their comparison, and the single LLP feature bit output expected vs emulated.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nValidated by running offline DQM on past commissioning runs, expected plots are produced. It has also been included in the online DQM production release based on 12_6_3 (https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/40737 to 12_6_X) and tested online during MWGR on 9 Feb.

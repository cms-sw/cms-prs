Added elements are the 6 fine grain bits occupancy readout at uHTR/layer1 and their comparison, and the single LLP feature bit output expected vs emulated.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nValidated by running offline DQM on past commissioning runs, expected plots are produced. It has also been included in the online DQM production release based on 12_6_3 (https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/40737 to 12_6_X) and tested online during MWGR on 9 Feb. Test went fine and PR has been made and merged to master (13_1_X) to make it permanent.\r\n\r\nThis is a backport of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/40751 to 13_0_X in order to be used during this year's data taking.\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1676393113", "deletions": 45, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "number": 40768, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[backport] HCAL Fb DQM monitoring at layer1", "updated_at": "1676393447", "user": "hftsoi"}

Specifically, \r\n1. Corrects the links in the summary webpage for the layercluster efficiency/merge rate/fake rate/duplicates, which are broken due to updates in `hgcalPlots.py` . \r\n2. Adds a geometry section containing material budget plots for HGCAL as well as from the vertex up to in front of muon stations. \r\n3. Updates the `html.py` to use the `allticlmulticluster` option among other updates for a nicer webpage environment regarding the material budget comparison plots. \r\n4. A flag is added in the main script to avoid overwriting the main index.html file of the webpage when experimenting or using it for other studies.  \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nWe have used these scripts to create the most recent campaign validation reports including the D76 phase 2 campaign for which we studied also material budget plots. \r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nThis is not a backport. \r\n\r\n@rovere @felicepantaleo @lecriste @ebrondol ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1615418242", "comments": 7, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1615383208", "deletions": 81, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "3e319e2c42e9a16633a76b81d4ca75e92ee3c4ae", "merged_at": "1615418241", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 33131, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "[HGCAL] Updates on the RelVal campaign scripts", "updated_at": "1615418242", "user": "apsallid"}

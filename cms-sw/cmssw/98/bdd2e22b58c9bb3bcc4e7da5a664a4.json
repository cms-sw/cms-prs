After the integration of [CMSHLT-2288](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSHLT-2288), those customisations are not needed anymore. In `12_3_X`, it was preferred to keep the functions around to minimise the chance of breaking workflows not maintained by HLT. The functions are considered deprecated, and a warning is issued accordingly (cc: @fwyzard).\r\n\r\n[*] This implies that this PR is not an exact backport of #37862.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTSG tests.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\n#37862\r\n\r\nDevelopment of HLT menus for Run-3 startup.", "branch": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "changed_files": 12, "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1652100086", "deletions": 4513, "labels": ["hlt-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "backport"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 37865, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "HLT menu development for `12_3_X` + deprecation of `customizeHLTforPatatrack` functions", "updated_at": "1652114375", "user": "missirol"}

After the integration of [CMSHLT-2288](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSHLT-2288), those customisations are not needed anymore. In `12_3_X`, it was preferred to keep the functions around to minimise the chance of breaking workflows not maintained by HLT. The functions are considered deprecated, and a warning is issued accordingly (cc: @fwyzard).\r\n\r\n[*] This implies that this PR is not an exact backport of #37862.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTSG tests.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\n#37862\r\n\r\nDevelopment of HLT menus for Run-3 startup.", "branch": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "changed_files": 12, "closed_at": "1652138659", "comments": 6, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1652100086", "deletions": 4513, "labels": ["hlt-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "backport-ok"], "merge_commit_sha": "72d598f1c1d780364cf704cb985c9d3b49f97ff0", "merged_at": "1652138659", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 37865, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "HLT menu development for `12_3_X` + deprecation of `customizeHLTforPatatrack` functions", "updated_at": "1652138659", "user": "missirol"}

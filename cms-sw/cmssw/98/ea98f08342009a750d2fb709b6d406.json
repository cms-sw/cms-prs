It is evident that such a possibility never happend, otherwise the code would have crashed there. However, to complete the fix initiated in #40498 another protection is added in the same file.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, a further protection is added to CommonTools/Statistics/src/LinearFit.cc, so that the code won't enter an infinite loop in case the ndat passed as argument is negative. Also this case evidently never happened so far, but since I noticed I put a protection also for it.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nIt compiles.\r\nNo differences exected anywhere", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1674475173", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "tracking"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "number": 40592, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Protection for n<=1 in RZLine.h", "updated_at": "1674563436", "user": "perrotta"}

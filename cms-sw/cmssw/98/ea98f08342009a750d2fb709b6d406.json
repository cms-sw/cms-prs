It is evident that such a possibility never happend, otherwise the code would have crashed there. However, to complete the fix initiated in #40498 another protection is added in the same file.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, a further protection is added to CommonTools/Statistics/src/LinearFit.cc, so that the code won't enter an infinite loop in case the ndat passed as argument is negative. Also this case evidently never happened so far, but since I noticed I put a protection also for it.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nIt compiles.\r\nNo differences exected anywhere", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1674639875", "comments": 15, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1674475173", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "requires-external", "code-checks-approved", "tracking"], "merge_commit_sha": "36656a3e23e0b60b6f6e2a0c3e3202c2109af037", "merged_at": "1674639875", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "number": 40592, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Protection for n<=1 in RZLine.h", "updated_at": "1674639876", "user": "perrotta"}

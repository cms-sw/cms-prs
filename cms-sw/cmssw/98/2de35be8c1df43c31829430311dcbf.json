The included variables are necessary to run b-tagging with ParticleNet, and has also been identified as helpful for additional analyses groups.\r\n- A couple of changes to HLTScoutingPFProducer.cc to bring the overall scouting data size down. These include:\r\n   - Reduced precision of vertex and jet quantities.\r\n   - Configurable option (`doCandIndsForJets`) which dictates if the output should contain the indices of the PF constituents of the jet.\r\n- Reduced precision of the vertex  quantities in the primary vertex producer.\r\n- Pt cut (default value of 0.3) for tracks in the track producer.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI ran `scram b runtests` as well as runTheMatrix. On lxplus runTheMatrix came back with 9 fails but all due to `DAS_ERROR`.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1644280825", "comments": 47, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1643615598", "deletions": 135, "labels": ["core-approved", "hlt-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "59434253c814848b0abe14bb49b6199cebc9fcd6", "merged_at": "1644280825", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 36840, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 58, "state": "closed", "title": "Update Scouting Run3 format", "updated_at": "1644280825", "user": "alintulu"}

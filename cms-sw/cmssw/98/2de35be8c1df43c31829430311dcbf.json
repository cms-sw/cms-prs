The included variables are necessary to run b-tagging with ParticleNet, and has also been identified as helpful for additional analyses groups.\r\n- A couple of changes to HLTScoutingPFProducer.cc to bring the overall scouting data size down. These include:\r\n   - Reduced precision of vertex and jet quantities.\r\n   - Configurable option (`doCandIndsForJets`) which dictates if the output should contain the indices of the PF constituents of the jet.\r\n- Reduced precision of the vertex  quantities in the primary vertex producer.\r\n- Pt cut (default value of 0.3) for tracks in the track producer.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI ran `scram b runtests` as well as runTheMatrix. On lxplus runTheMatrix came back with 9 fails but all due to `DAS_ERROR`.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "comments": 22, "commits": 9, "created_at": "1643615598", "deletions": 101, "labels": ["hlt-pending", "core-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 36840, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 41, "state": "open", "title": "Update Scouting Run3 format", "updated_at": "1643792942", "user": "alintulu"}

This refactoring is to simplify structure of deep-tau code after keeping only one type of deep-tau discriminators. This should be regarded as first step for changes to enable running of deepTauID with SONIC service.\r\n\r\nChanges in the code are minor: they consist moving and combining methods of the removed base and `DeepTauId` classes.\r\n\r\nChanges in outputs are not expected.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCustom tests with deepTauID production as well as matrix tests (`runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos`) passed successfully.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1685618225", "deletions": 429, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_2_X", "number": 41841, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Combine DeepTauBase with DeepTauId class", "updated_at": "1685623289", "user": "mbluj"}

The RecoEcal files create a new collection of supercluster based on a corrected rechit collection. The RecoEgamma/ElectronPhotonProducers and RecoEgamma/ElectronElectronProducers files replace the superclusters in existing electrons and photons with the corrected ones. The RecoParticleFlow, RecoEgamma/EgammaIsolationAlgos and RecoEgamma/ElectronIdentification files link the properties of the old electrons and photons to the new ones. The files in RecoEgamma/EgammaTools control the modifications. We have an example of the whole sequence in RecoEgamma/EgammaTools/test/miniaod_PAT.py where the processes to be loaded and customization to be used can be found.\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 53, "closed_at": "1485879521", "comments": 89, "commits": 79, "created_at": "1485444362", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 17296, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 25, "state": "closed", "title": "Mitigation of the ECAL gain switch problem for re-miniAOD", "updated_at": "1485879521", "user": "rafaellopesdesa"}

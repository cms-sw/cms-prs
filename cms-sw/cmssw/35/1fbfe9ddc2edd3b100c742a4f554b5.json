This monitoring is now running also in case of fake primary vertex, allowing the code to run also on particle guns output, where the usual vertex selection fails;\r\n- the local reconstruction monitoring is optimised by adding a ```break``` statement in the loop to match simulated and reconstructed hits inside a cluster. The time taken should be significantly cut, especially on events with PU;\r\n- several debugging printout is added or polished, also in cluster reconstruction classes.\r\n\r\nThe memory addition to histogram output has been measured to be about 6 KiB.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTest MTD validation configuration runs smoothly and provide the desired histograms. As a side note ```SimTrack``` producing hits in ETL are not saved, as outside the tracker volume. This issue should be addressed in a separate development.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 9, "comments": 0, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1653401714", "deletions": 58, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 38064, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "MTD validation: update track-MTD matching efficiency monitoring", "updated_at": "1653401736", "user": "fabiocos"}

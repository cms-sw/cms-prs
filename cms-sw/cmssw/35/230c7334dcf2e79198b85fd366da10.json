It does not implement any tests for CMSSW plugins (yet).\r\nIt does not aim to be merged in its current form.\r\n\r\nThe package `HeterogeneousCore/CUDATestDevice` implements a library that defines and exports CUDA device-only functions, and a test that uses them.\r\n\r\nThe package `HeterogeneousCore/CUDATestKernel` implements a library that imports device functions from `HeterogeneousCore/CUDATestDevice` to define and export CUDA kernels, and a test that uses them.\r\n\r\nThe package `HeterogeneousCore/CUDATestWrapper` implements a library that imports kernels from `HeterogeneousCore/CUDATestKernel` to define and export host-only wrappers around them, usable by non-CUDA libraries, plugins and applications, and implements a test that uses them.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe new unit tests compile and pass.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 15, "comments": 19, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1674578029", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "new-package-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "number": 40605, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Add a test for CUDA library build rules", "updated_at": "1674632465", "user": "fwyzard"}

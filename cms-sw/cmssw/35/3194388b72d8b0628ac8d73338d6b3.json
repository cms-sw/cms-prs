It was updated in Jun (https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/38418) to better support DatasetPaths.\r\n\r\nIn doing so a bug was introduced in that if a path is after a dataset path, the wrong L1 and prescale module will be identified.\r\n\r\nAdditionally the logic was improved to only consider the first seed module and also to disregard ignored modules. This fixes problems in some paths which have additional L1 seed modules which are ignored as they want to use this data later in the path.\r\n\r\nCredit goes to Adelina Lintuluoto (@alintulu) for spotting this issue in the hilton tests.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nvalidation in : https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/39779\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

Automatic loading of missing dictionaries is not working properly.\nAutoloading is not normally needed because the dictionary for a class is normally in the same package as the code for the class.   This is not true for DataFormats/StdDictionaries and DataFormats/WrappedStdDictionaries.   StdDictionaries is already always loaded.  This request does the same for WrappedStdDictionaries.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_ROOT6_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1386481460", "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1386478187", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["core-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "5bc35ebf7ab75b99301fc7b19d77b6cf708cb99d", "merged_at": "1386481460", "merged_by": "ktf", "number": 1720, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add link dependencies on WrappedStdDictionaries", "updated_at": "1402737894", "user": "wmtan"}

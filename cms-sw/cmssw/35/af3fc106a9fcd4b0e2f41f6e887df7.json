Fix the pulse shape used for MC to be number 105\n2. If method 2 fails (nan issue) or not used (e.g., tstrig < ts4Min), it falls back now to Method 0\n3. Add an option to control number of fit iterations\n4. Separate out the hbheNegativeFlagSetter from the puCorrMethod switch. It was switched off when Method 1 was disabled. This hbheNegaviteFlagSetter is controlled by setNegativeFlags_ anyway.\n5.

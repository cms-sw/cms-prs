One that was unused was removed. The other was easily replaced by a variable on the stack.\nThe two remaining mutable data members are more difficult to replace, and will be left alone for now.\nTested with checkdeps -a and the relval matrix.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1384168607", "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1383768659", "deletions": 33, "labels": ["fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "2f445b13c9d9eaa051c9f6f4227ad28ade0165b7", "merged_at": "1384168607", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_0_0_pre9", "number": 1358, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Remove or replace two mutable data members from SteppingHelixPropagator", "updated_at": "1406907577", "user": "wmtan"}

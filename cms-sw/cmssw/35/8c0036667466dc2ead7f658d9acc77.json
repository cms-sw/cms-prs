Also, the same checks were performed in the MinimumBias dataset produced for 1000 events. Please, see slides 1-9 from here [1].\r\n\r\nNo significant changes were observed in event and track variables while removing the No-Looper condition except the Hit count distribution. \r\n\r\nAn issue had been raised already regarding disabling looper reconstruction for HeavyIons. Please look here [2] for detail. \r\n\r\n \r\nLink for the HI Trackin POG: \r\n[1] https://indico.cern.ch/event/1153062/contributions/4841907/attachments/2429416/4159748/NoLooper_HITracking.pdf \r\n\r\nLink for the issue:\r\n[2] https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/35758\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRun time observations and a detailed study of each track variable have been performed with enabling and disabling trackingNoLoopers. We have also performed a detailed comparison of tracking efficiency, fake, multiple, and nonprimary reconstruction fractions for central, peripheral, and minimum bias events with enabling and disabling trackingNoLoopers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n\r\ncc: @mandrenguyen, @abaty, @CesarBernardes", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 4, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1651807418", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["operations-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 37833, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Disabled looper reconstruction in HI Era for Run 3", "updated_at": "1651808294", "user": "sayanchatterjee38"}

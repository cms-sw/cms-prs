It should replaced with a better and more general implementation, and the use of the host collection should be removed.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nFull 2024 HLT menu works with these changes, both on CPU and on GPU.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

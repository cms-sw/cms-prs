So removing this dependence would mean a retraining is mandatory. Given the very tight timescales, it is very unlikely that we will be able to retrain the models in time and we expect to rely on the existing models already merged into cms-data. It _may_ be possible for the 10_5_X cycle, but almost certainly not the 10_2_X cycle, which need for data processing ~now. \r\n\r\n@perrotta @slava77 @mverzett @nancymarinelli \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1548530568", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_5_X", "number": 25773, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Move lowPtGsfElectronSequence back to highlevelreco (105X)", "updated_at": "1548531039", "user": "bainbrid"}

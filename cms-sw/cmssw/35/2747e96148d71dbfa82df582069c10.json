However, this is in fact never done in the simulation. This pull request addresses that for the CLCT processor. In another PR, I'll do the same for the ALCT processor. Note that the correlation of ALCT and CLCT still only considers the best/second best of ALCT and CLCT.\r\n\r\nEdit: I added an updated for the ALCT processor, simulating all ALCTs. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI made a few validation plots (see below) by re-emulating the ALCT/CLCT and LCT on 25000 events in the file block ```/ZeroBias/Run2018D-v1/RAW#5dd68d0d-5a62-4bfe-9065-cc0cd92e3f3e``` (```/store/data/Run2018D/ZeroBias/RAW/v1/000/324/022/00000/```). \r\n- For CLCTs: Black are the unpacked CLCTs. Red are the re-emulated CLCTs from RAW digis. \r\n- For LCTs: Black are the unpacked LCTs. Blue and red are the re-emulated LCTs from RAW digis.\r\n\r\nPlots look good. You will notice slightly bigger differences from the positive endcap (\"pAll\"). This is because we were testing newer firmware during the 2018D period on a few ME+1/1 chambers.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n@tahuang1991 ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 9, "closed_at": "1588920587", "comments": 22, "commits": 8, "created_at": "1587908587", "deletions": 134, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "41fc5b7baff5c4feb48e6a0c7f0d9e5f38abbda0", "merged_at": "1588920587", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 29562, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Simulate all ALCTs and CLCTs in the CSC trigger", "updated_at": "1592529368", "user": "dildick"}

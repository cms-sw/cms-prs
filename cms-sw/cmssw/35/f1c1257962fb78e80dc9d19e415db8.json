This follows from the ETL digitization model update of PR https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/43762.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nThe code compiles and runs.\r\nIt was validated on a RelValSinglePiFlatPt0p7To10 sample.  The efficiency of reco-sim cluster association is recovered. \r\n\r\n![testPR](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/assets/4562259/b2dad96b-8743-4e2c-b73b-ed245e954c4e)\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 4, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1713872987", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["simulation-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 44818, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[MTD] Mtd association maps: remove energy selection for ETL clusters", "updated_at": "1713876504", "user": "martinamalberti"}

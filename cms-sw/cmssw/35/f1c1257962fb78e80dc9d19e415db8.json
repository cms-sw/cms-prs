This follows from the ETL digitization model update of PR https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/43762.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nThe code compiles and runs.\r\nIt was validated on a RelValSinglePiFlatPt0p7To10 sample.  The efficiency of reco-sim cluster association is recovered. \r\n\r\n![testPR](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/assets/4562259/b2dad96b-8743-4e2c-b73b-ed245e954c4e)\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1715280179", "comments": 10, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1713872987", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["simulation-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "upgrade-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "df87b723ad7612f7c824c3c6d1ff2eab843a6028", "merged_at": "1715280179", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 44818, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "[MTD] Mtd association maps: remove energy selection for ETL clusters", "updated_at": "1715280180", "user": "martinamalberti"}

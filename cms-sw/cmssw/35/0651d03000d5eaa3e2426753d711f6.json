Changing this to (idx >= 0) fixes the problem so that all daughters are assigned a mother.  I've tested it out on a few samples and encountered no problems.  Please let me know (w.wulsin@cern.ch) if you have any questions.\n\nWells\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_2_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1409732934", "comments": 5, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1408527167", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "75f9e44adb96985374e406c68303f7bf8af50285", "merged_at": "1409732934", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_2_X", "number": 5008, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Gen particle pruner bug fix", "updated_at": "1409733934", "user": "wulsin"}

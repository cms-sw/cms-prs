The new bit manipulation gives the same results (as tested in the unit test) but avoids the undefined behavior.\r\n\r\nThis was found by UBSAN.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe code compiles and the new unit test succeeds. The unit test also shows that the UBSAN error goes away.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1563732839", "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1563566182", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "8bcb7f7596e5284baa554fc5007d60fbabc35e87", "merged_at": "1563732839", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27572, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Avoid unrepresentable int value in BitSet", "updated_at": "1563732839", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

Fixed code to preserve electron mass to prevent it from going to 0. CMS is not really sensitive to the electron mass, so the change to physics should be negligible. This should be percolated through the various active releases.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1689193021", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["fastsim-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-rejected"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_2_X", "number": 42250, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "preserving electron mass after FastSim Bremsstrahlung emmision", "updated_at": "1689193485", "user": "sbein"}

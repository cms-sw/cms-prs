The check on the eta range is now implemented as a function checking a vector of eta windows to handle the five cuts in a easier way.\r\n* New track finder index feature for muons in the uGT emulator needed for the update of the 2023 L1 menu as detailed in [CMSLITDPG-1075](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSLITDPG-1075)). Note that the missing muon index data is also included in the GtRecordDumper, needed to produce a test vector as input to the firmware validation. The bits assigned to muon index in the muon object are 36..42 (see Table 6 in the uGT firmware documentation - [scales_inputs_2_ugt.pdf](https://github.com/cms-l1-globaltrigger/mp7_ugt_legacy/blob/master/doc/scales_inputs_2_ugt/pdf/scales_inputs_2_ugt.pdf)).

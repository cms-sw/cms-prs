The check on the eta range is now implemented as a function checking a vector of eta windows to handle the five cuts in a easier way.\r\n* New track finder index feature for muons in the uGT emulator needed for the update of the 2023 L1 menu as detailed in [CMSLITDPG-1075](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSLITDPG-1075)). Note that the missing muon index data is also included in the GtRecordDumper, needed to produce a test vector as input to the firmware validation. The bits assigned to muon index in the muon object are 36..42 (see Table 6 in the uGT firmware documentation - [scales_inputs_2_ugt.pdf](https://github.com/cms-l1-globaltrigger/mp7_ugt_legacy/blob/master/doc/scales_inputs_2_ugt/pdf/scales_inputs_2_ugt.pdf)). Thank you @arnobaer and Herbert for the work!\r\n\r\nThese updates are needed for the deployment of the Run L1 menu [L1Menu_Collisions2023_v1_0_1](https://github.com/cms-l1-dpg/L1MenuRun3/tree/master/development/L1Menu_Collisions2023_v1_0_1) in view of the first stable beams at 13.6 TeV or soon after. \r\nBackport to CMSSW_13_0_X: https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/41313.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nBasic tests performed successfully starting from CMSSW_13_1_X_2023-04-06-1100\r\n> cmsrel CMSSW_13_1_X_2023-04-06-1100\r\n> cd CMSSW_13_1_X_2023-04-06-1100/src\r\n> cmsenv\r\n> git cms-addpkg L1Trigger/L1TGlobal \r\n> git cms-addpkg L1Trigger/Configuration\r\n> scram b distclean \r\n> git cms-checkdeps -a -A\r\n> scram b -j 8\r\n> scram b runtests \r\n> scram build code-checks\r\n> scram build code-format\r\n\r\nA cross-check of the countings of each trigger bit in the new firmware and in the updated emulator is ongoing before considering the PR ready.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 9, "comments": 11, "commits": 9, "created_at": "1681193313", "deletions": 208, "labels": ["l1-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_1_X", "number": 41312, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "open", "title": "Adding the new muon track finder index and three eta cuts features in the GT emulator", "updated_at": "1681833348", "user": "elfontan"}

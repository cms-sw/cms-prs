The appropriate training to be used is selected automatically. The idea is that the variable name will stay the same in the future, selecting a new training when appropriate.\r\n- For this reason the latest training (2018UL) is used as a default, but as new trainings will be available for run3 this should be updated accordingly.\r\n- No need to store working points as bools since these can be easily derived from the MVA value.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n- Tested in CMSSW_12_4_0_pre1; verified that the new variable is added correctly.\r\n- Adds 1 float per electron.\r\n\r\n@namapane pls follow", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 575, "comments": 34, "commits": 347, "created_at": "1648794267", "deletions": 43958, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-rejected", "xpog-pending", "egamma"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 37429, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 9, "state": "open", "title": "Adding HZZ electron MVA ID", "updated_at": "1654677649", "user": "asculac"}

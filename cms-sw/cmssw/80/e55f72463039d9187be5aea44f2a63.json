This segfault has been observed as far back as 5_3_X.\nPull request requested in 6_2_X by David Lange.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_6_2_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1394614412", "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1393966403", "deletions": 8, "labels": ["core-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "5d6de234f337895711cb9bf94beef46f9bf0d3a1", "merged_at": "1394614412", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_6_2_X", "number": 2720, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Avoid playback segfault on empty file list", "updated_at": "1394658982", "user": "wmtan"}

Histograms with more than around 1e7 entries in a bin will stop accumulation in that bin (because within numerical precision `x + 1. == x`).\r\nThis PR changes the booking of `StandaloneTrackMonitor` and `TrackTypeMonitor` plots, from using `book1D` to `book1DD` in order to use double precision in bin content accumulation.\r\nTo limit the amount of changes in the tracking monitor classes a new overloaded `book1DD` method is added to `DQMStore` in order to be able to use the `TH1D` constructor of the type that creates a 1-Dim histogram with variable bins of type `double`: \r\n`TH1D (const char *name, const char *title, Int_t nbinsx, const Float_t *xbins)`\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n`cmssw` compiles.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

This type is heavily used in PFEcalSuperCluster code.\r\n\r\nThe second part of the issue https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/38059 about the use of `vector<CalibratedPFCluster>` instead of `edm::PtrVector<>` is postponed to a later PR.  For the moment, the `CalibratedClusterPtrVector` has been changed from `vector<shared_ptr<CalibratedPFCluster>>` to `vector<CalibratedPFCluster>`.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nThis PR should not have any side effect. It would be interesting to trigger the profiling ON to check for any memory/timing improvement.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1673282603", "deletions": 81, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "number": 40460, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Refactoring CalibratedClusterPtr to CalibratedPFCluster", "updated_at": "1673640610", "user": "valsdav"}

These normalized chi2 values are used in many heavy ion analyses as part of the track selection.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis was checked using the config in /afs/cern.ch/user/a/abaty/work/public/forPeople/forChi2PR, which was used for testing the heavy ion miniAOD workflow.  Both new collections (for lostTracks and PackedPFCandidates) are present and contain reasonable values.\r\n\r\n@mandrenguyen \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1595654333", "comments": 65, "commits": 10, "created_at": "1594072811", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "589ccc5ae0dc273f1a90031cd069c91f71c9ad40", "merged_at": "1595654333", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 30566, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 17, "state": "closed", "title": "Addition of packedCandidates track chi2 information to pp_on_AA miniAOD", "updated_at": "1595654334", "user": "abaty"}

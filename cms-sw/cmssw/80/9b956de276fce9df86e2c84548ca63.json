This trivial pull request modifies the CMSSW_7_4_ROOT6_X files to be identical with those in CMSSW_7_4_X by adding or removing blank lines.  This may prevent some merge conflicts or merge errors in the future, and avoids spurious differences when comparing releases.\nPlease merge this totally trivial pull request as soon as convenient.\nTest it if you must, but please bypass L2 signatures.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_ROOT6_X", "changed_files": 51, "closed_at": "1426539982", "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1426539380", "deletions": 33, "labels": ["alca-pending", "analysis-pending", "comparison-pending", "core-pending", "db-pending", "dqm-pending", "fastsim-pending", "generators-pending", "hlt-pending", "l1-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending", "visualization-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "bec8ff99fc68657a5aa835a8ad3366fb311f240e", "merged_at": "1426539982", "merged_by": "davidlt", "number": 8335, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add or remove blank lines to make consistent with 7_4_X", "updated_at": "1426597446", "user": "wmtan"}

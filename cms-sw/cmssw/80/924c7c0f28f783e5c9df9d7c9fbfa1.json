It does so with the help of an intermediate data format, the TICLCandidate, by converting the TICL output (a list of tracksters) into TICLCandidates, and subsequently the TICLCandidates into regular PFCandidates. It also adds DQM plots for the such-produced PFCandidates.\r\n\r\nPresentations were given in a RECO/AT meeting, https://indico.cern.ch/event/841640/contributions/3539177/attachments/1896768/3129567/2019_08_23_reco.pdf, and in an HGCAL DPG meeting, https://indico.cern.ch/event/849004/contributions/3567562/attachments/1910534/3156782/2019_09_18_hgcal_dpg.pdf\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe workflow has been validated by enabling TICL as defined in RecoHGCal/TICL/python/ticl_iterations.py and checking the DQM output.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR: -\r\n\r\n @rovere @felicepantaleo @bendavid @hatakeyamak  (HGCal RECO and PF)\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 25, "closed_at": "1571844422", "comments": 61, "commits": 18, "created_at": "1570197640", "deletions": 11, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "5a7a18596c65bfd015bb369c5b6854e98443b608", "merged_at": "1571844421", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 28116, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 20, "state": "closed", "title": "TICL: Create PF candidates as output of TICL", "updated_at": "1571844422", "user": "steggema"}

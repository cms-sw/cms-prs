In ROOT 5. std::basic_string is used.\nIn the conditions code, the ROOT 5 name must be converted to the ROOT 6 name.  This was done before, but only for those cases where the ROOT 5 name was followed by a space.  This causes relval failures.\nThis pull request does the conversion in those cases where the ROOT 5 name is not followed by a space.\nPlease merge this promptly unless there is a problem.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_ROOT6_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1393355888", "comments": 0, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1393355703", "deletions": 0, "labels": [], "merge_commit_sha": "231a7ad8b9416d40fed677ef505888bce0e2f4fb", "merged_at": "1393355888", "merged_by": "davidlt", "number": 2638, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Use correct ROOT6 name in all cases", "updated_at": "1393356373", "user": "wmtan"}

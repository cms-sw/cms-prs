I tested with workflow ```4003.0``` without any errors.\r\n\r\nI also did an additional validation of the change in ```CMSSW_15_1_0``` with workflows ```4003.0``` and ```11650.0```.\r\n\r\nPasses unit tests.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

This led to crashes being untested until an early MW GR. The GT input unpacking was disabled.\n\nThis PR is the proper fix, which allows GT unpacker to be turned back on. This PR includes updates to our integration tests which check the unity of GT packing + unpacking. (As for Calo and GMT).\n\nThis PR supersedes #14291.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 26, "closed_at": "1462947357", "comments": 9, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1462191705", "deletions": 94, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "1d70f316b4ee1a5da7fc77e1b2c0970f79333b29", "merged_at": "1462947357", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 14323, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Updates to L1T packer needed to simultaneously pack GT inputs and GMT/Calo ouputs", "updated_at": "1462947357", "user": "mulhearn"}

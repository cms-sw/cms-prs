ME0 Pseudo-Digis are not yet produced / kept, but that will be for another PR.\n\nPlease test and sign.\nThanks\nPiet\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 14, "closed_at": "1432907820", "comments": 51, "commits": 58, "created_at": "1431013280", "deletions": 12, "labels": ["comparison-available", "geometry-approved", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved", "visualization-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "88f5deabd1c9c36827a943174059afe4e31d9751", "merged_at": "1432907820", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 8995, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "Ideal geometry2015 muon", "updated_at": "1432941172", "user": "pietverwilligen"}

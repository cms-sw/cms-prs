We can extend it test other options of `cmsTraceFunction`\r\n\r\n\r\nFYI @makortel ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1755093688", "comments": 15, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1754900442", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "ab50343a75a8e1ae33dd3dcbeafa91390b9c22d7", "merged_at": "1755093688", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 48714, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "[GDB] Added unit tests for gdb and running cmsTraceFunction", "updated_at": "1755093689", "user": "smuzaffar"}

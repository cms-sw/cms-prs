This PR extends the matching to recover such cases, by adding the possibility that electrons can be matched to gendressed particles. This issue has been reported here: \r\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/962278/contributions/4060711/attachments/2136665/3599026/electron_matching_nano_nov4.pdf\r\n\r\nand further discussed here: \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/cms-nanoAOD/cmssw/issues/552\r\n\r\nThe electron matching is performed as follows:\r\n\r\n+ Electrons are first matched to a collection of dressed electrons. This collection is identical to the GenDressedLepton collection that is stored in nanoAOD, but with a looser pt cut. If there's a match, the Electron_genPartFlav variable is set to 1 or 15, depending on the mother of the dressed lepton. Electron_genPartIdx is the index of the electron en GenPart that corresponds to the constituent of the matched dressed leptons with highest pt and abs(pdgId)==11.\r\n+ For the electrons not matched in the previous step, the logic is the same as in the previous implementation: electrons are matched to GenPart and then Electron_genPartIdx and Electron_genPartFlav are assigned according to this match. \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1617006335", "comments": 36, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1614010122", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved", "xpog-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "393780c5887592627fad0e66642d4d2a039ef2dc", "merged_at": "1617006335", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 32966, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Extension of electron matching in nanoAOD", "updated_at": "1617126177", "user": "sscruz"}

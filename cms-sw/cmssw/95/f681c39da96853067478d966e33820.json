After performing several tests, Tracker DPG concluded that it was related to the cut that is imposed for number of max. pixel clusters per event in Cosmic tracking, see [slides](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1455576/contributions/6165164/attachments/2940845/5166520/241004_Cosmic_rate.pdf). The average number of clusters in pixel has steadily increased and reaching ```300```(default value till now) is roughly correlated in time with the rate drop. We are increasing the threshold to ```1000``` in the configs for Cosmic tracking.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.\r\nNot a backport.

These new methods should not change the behavior of existing programs. Some error checking has been added to the `DDFilteredView` that could change the output of misbehaving programs.\r\n\r\nTracker migration to DD4hep requires some of these new utilities, so it would be helpful to merge this PR promptly.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nUnit tests ran successfully. These utilities will be exercised more fully by the upcoming magnetic field geometry builder PR.\r\n\r\n#### No backport.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1564037209", "comments": 33, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1563569964", "deletions": 7, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "4d147d72d5e05807c0ff4e66ec100ec6123bf693", "merged_at": "1564037209", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27574, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 15, "state": "closed", "title": "Enhancements to support the magnetic field geometry builder", "updated_at": "1564037209", "user": "cvuosalo"}

The modification is to enable triggering on the negative timing region that can target beam halo and satellite collisions, and allow for maximum timing to be specified in the positive timing side to enable some delayed jet triggers to be added to parking dataset.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nFrom the description of #41089:\r\n\r\n> I ran over HLTPhysics using Run2022G dataset and saw no change in the rates.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

For the cases where an iteration makes use of multiple MVA selectors (as in phase0), a similar logic is used as in MultiTrackValidator, i.e.\r\n- For the first MVA there is one histogram called \"MVA1\"\r\n- For the second MVA there are two histograms\r\n  * \"MVA2\" for tracks not selected as loose by the first MVA\r\n  * \"MVA2HP\" for tracks not selected as highPurity by the first MVA\r\n- Same for third MVA (and possibly onwards)\r\n\r\nI also removed two obsolete configuration parameters (OutputMEsInRootFile and OutputFileName) to not hit the 255 parameter limit (and needing to modify the entire TrackingMonitor_cfi).\r\n\r\nTested in CMSSW_9_2_3. Expecting new histograms in phase0 and phase1, and no changes in phase2.\r\n\r\n@rovere @VinInn @mtosi @hajohajo", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 12, "closed_at": "1499321940", "comments": 14, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1498740230", "deletions": 33, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "50c0c51a6d63265ac7c716c5ea8134bb85ddea95", "merged_at": "1499321940", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_3_X", "number": 19481, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add track selection MVA plots to tracking DQM", "updated_at": "1499321940", "user": "makortel"}

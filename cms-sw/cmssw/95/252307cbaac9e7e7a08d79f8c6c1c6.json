This affects the behavior of the current tracker DQM trend plots. They are no longer correctly updated to accommodate an expanded histogram axis to show trends vs lumi section for longer runs for example, since the histograms can no longer be rebinned. This fix updates the use of the SetBit(kCanRebin) option to SetCanExtend(TH1::kAllAxes) as recommended for ROOT6 in the Tracker DQM code and is needed quite urgently to restore the correct behavior for the trend plots. Also, the code for DQMRootSource (DQMServices/FwkIO/plugins/DQMRootSource.cc) is updated for the merging of rebinnable histograms during harvesting to be compatible with the new ROOT6 behavior (the old TestBit(TH1::kCanRebin) is replaced with the new CanExtendAllAxes()).\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 8, "closed_at": "1433957691", "comments": 12, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1433228403", "deletions": 38, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "89e5095f5b4f0b9f5d5ec8cbcc7de259b6cb72d8", "merged_at": "1433957691", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 9400, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix to allow histogram rebinning to work again for Tracker DQM trend plots in ROOT6", "updated_at": "1433957691", "user": "vdutta"}

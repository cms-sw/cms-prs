These are the last 4 output modules using the legacy base class in CMSSW. Soon after this is approved and merged I will submit another PR deleting the legacy OutputModule base class entirely. Note that these 4 output modules are only used in tests.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nExisting unit tests run and pass. I manually ran 3 of these with some added print commands inserted to verify they were running properly and compared the output before and after the changes. IOExerciser is a module available for benchmarking tests, but was already broken . Probably it is easily fixable, but I didn't spend the time as nothing in CMSSW appears to be using it anyway. I migrated it and don't think the migration made its existing problems better or worse. (Maybe it is just calling selectEvents too early ...).\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1588399011", "comments": 22, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1588354148", "deletions": 15, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "3b7d90b198ab769a94b0193b3ff7938f5000357e", "merged_at": "1588399011", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 29615, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 4, "state": "closed", "title": "Migrate legacy output modules to be 'one' types", "updated_at": "1588399011", "user": "wddgit"}

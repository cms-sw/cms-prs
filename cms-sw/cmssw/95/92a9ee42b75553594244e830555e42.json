All affected files will be identical in the two releases after this PR is merged.  Changes were successfully tested with the short relval matrix and unit test.\nThe changes are:\n1) An extra include needed for ROOT6.\n2) Code featured out by conditional compilation was changed to a comments.\n3) A \"long long\" was replaced by a more descriptive typedef.\n4) Macro exit codes used only in unit tests  changed from 1 to 0.  0 is correct. Tests still pass.\n5) an unnecessary forward declaration was removed.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1426623257", "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1426620472", "deletions": 23, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "core-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "ff9d1ec2bd40f3d8befff5534cd903f6b0f0262a", "merged_at": "1426623257", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 8361, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Port back from ROOT6 IB for commonality (Core)", "updated_at": "1426703922", "user": "wmtan"}

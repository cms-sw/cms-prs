Since there is a chance that we will not be able to switch to the new modules soon (it depends on the storage manager), this is a quick short-term fix to prevent the menu from crashing. The new modules will be modified to avoid the use of hard-coded numbers (it's a bit tricky because these are in static functions and thus do not have access to most class members).\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1461649223", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1461321744", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "hlt-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "e5c7f22015ece46d86d5404cc6cb217b3d8b540b", "merged_at": "1461649223", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 14204, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Short term fix for number of HLT paths", "updated_at": "1461649223", "user": "avetisya"}

The tests that previously used the `GENERATE_SOA_VIEW` macro have been updated to utilize the `View` constructor by columns, introduced in [#47306](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/47306). Additionally, a heterogeneous `deepCopy` method has been added to both `PortableHostCollection` and `PortableDeviceCollection`, allowing users to copy data from potentially different memory buffers across various devices, and consolidating the columns into a single contiguous memory buffer. This new feature leverages the `Descriptor` and `ConstDescriptor` structs, also introduced in this PR within `SoALayout.h`, which provide an interface to iterate over the SoA columns without relying on their names. This approach was implemented to keep the SoA backend independent from alpaka.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe added unit test passes.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 44, "comments": 12, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1748592814", "deletions": 1304, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "alca-pending", "db-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-approved", "heterogeneous-pending", "ngt", "allow-leobeltra"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 48216, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Merged SoAView into SoALayout and added heterogeneous deepCopy for PortableCollections", "updated_at": "1748876061", "user": "leobeltra"}

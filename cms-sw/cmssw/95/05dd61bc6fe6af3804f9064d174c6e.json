The tests that previously used the `GENERATE_SOA_VIEW` macro have been updated to utilize the `View` constructor by columns, introduced in [#47306](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/47306). Additionally, a heterogeneous `deepCopy` method has been added to both `PortableHostCollection` and `PortableDeviceCollection`, allowing users to copy data from potentially different memory buffers across various devices, and consolidating the columns into a single contiguous memory buffer. This new feature leverages the `Descriptor` and `ConstDescriptor` structs, also introduced in this PR within `SoALayout.h`, which provide an interface to iterate over the SoA columns without relying on their names. This approach was implemented to keep the SoA backend independent from alpaka.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe added unit test passes.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 44, "closed_at": "1750955287", "comments": 62, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1748592814", "deletions": 1305, "labels": ["alca-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "db-approved", "orp-approved", "upgrade-approved", "code-checks-approved", "heterogeneous-approved", "tests-ib-failure", "ngt", "allow-leobeltra"], "merge_commit_sha": "f73d140cac66adb60909de86cccb6f881a887dc6", "merged_at": "1750955287", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 48216, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 16, "state": "closed", "title": "Merged SoAView into SoALayout and added heterogeneous deepCopy for PortableCollections", "updated_at": "1750955288", "user": "leobeltra"}

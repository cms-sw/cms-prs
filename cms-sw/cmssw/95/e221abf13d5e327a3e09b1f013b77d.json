If you change this 3.8 to 3 we allow photons up to eta 3 but in the HF we make neutral hadrons which are much close to the jets in the HF than photons.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1402393291", "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1402389133", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "ef4f2aeb561ff0a3f9a77a90c8d9a16b287da5ec", "merged_at": "1402393291", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "number": 4181, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Change tracker eta boundary for PF linking", "updated_at": "1402896766", "user": "mark-grimes"}

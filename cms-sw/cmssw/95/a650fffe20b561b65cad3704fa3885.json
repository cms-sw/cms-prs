A position dependence of the amplitude measured in the sensors at the two extremities of the crystal is introduced, with values from tunable parameters, currently from BTL test beam studies.\r\n\r\nThe BTL digitization validation is updated accordingly to monitor this effect.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe code has been used to produce the results shown in the presentation above", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": "1679301202", "comments": 15, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1678466782", "deletions": 49, "labels": ["dqm-approved", "simulation-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "upgrade-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "ce98e5b46b37a62113837011a36ed3d2a3124287", "merged_at": "1679301202", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_13_1_X", "number": 41027, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "MTD digitization: add position dependence to BTL amplitudes", "updated_at": "1679301202", "user": "fabiocos"}

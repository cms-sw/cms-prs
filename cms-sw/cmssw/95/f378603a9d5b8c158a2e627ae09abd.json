This compiles fine and looks OK to me, but is untested since I have no convenient way to do it. I avoid the necessity of modifying 14 associated config files by hard-coding the InputTags for sim and real wire and strip digis required by the consumes interface. (The existing configs only contain InputTags for rechits, segments, trand-alone muons, global muons, tracks.)\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1380095108", "comments": 5, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1379055717", "deletions": 25, "labels": ["operations-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "61f8ce1a5d4fa1b158f7b37f827a70033e8ce7fc", "merged_at": "1380095108", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_0_0_pre5", "number": 820, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Migration to consumes -- CSCSkim", "updated_at": "1380095108", "user": "ptcox"}

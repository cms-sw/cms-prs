However many times it seems that these are only passing accidentally due to small numbers of events in the matrix tests. I have tried to make this more robust by switching from bare C++ pointers to edm::Ptrs. The matrix tests have succeeded again, but hopefully not only accidentally this time. \n\nIf there are better suggestions for testing more DQM events please let me know!\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_2_X", "changed_files": 10, "closed_at": "1407073495", "comments": 4, "commits": 14, "created_at": "1406298866", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "new-package-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "5119e088714453859a095da1d90e1ef81601d64b", "merged_at": "1407073495", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_2_X", "number": 4793, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "B2G HLT DQM Request, Take 2", "updated_at": "1416853424", "user": "rappoccio"}

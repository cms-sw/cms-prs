In addition, I added alternative makers without `ConsumesCollector` for `TrackingParticleSelector` and `GenParticleCustomSelector`. Strictly speaking these are not needed for this PR, but I had them done already before decided to switch the migration strategy (and they simplify a bit the interfaces, e.g. now it is clear from `MTVHistoProducerAlgo` interface that it does not read anything from the event).\r\n\r\nTested in CMSSW_10_0_X_2017-12-23-1100, no changes expected in results.\r\n\r\nFYI @VinInn @rovere @hajohajo @fwyzard ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 12, "comments": 18, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1514722851", "deletions": 946, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "code-checks-pending", "comparison-pending", "dqm-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_0_X", "number": 21794, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "open", "title": "Migrate MultiTrackValidator to concurrent DQM", "updated_at": "1516268707", "user": "makortel"}

This PR modifies the current CCLUT implementation in CSC TP producer and EMTF emulator to split the cases for TMBs and OTMBs. \r\n\r\nAfter these changes, the CCLUT algorithm can be enabled for CSC stations/rings with OTMBs or TMBs with the specific flags `runCCLUT_OTMB` and `runCCLUT_TMB` respectively. Currently, both of the flags are set to `False`, so we expect no change in trigger performance. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nValidated with `runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos` and no changes are observed.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n\r\nFYI @dildick \r\n\r\nBefore submitting your pull requests, make sure you followed this checklist:\r\n- verify that the PR is really intended for the chosen branch\r\n- verify that changes follow [CMS Naming, Coding, And Style Rules](http://cms-sw.github.io/cms_coding_rules.html)\r\n- verify that the PR passes the basic test procedure suggested in the [CMSSW PR instructions](https://cms-sw.github.io/PRWorkflow.html)\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 12, "comments": 5, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1634062701", "deletions": 25, "labels": ["l1-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "number": 35632, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "EMTF emulator and CSC TP producer changes for the new CCLUT implementation", "updated_at": "1634569322", "user": "eyigitba"}

This existing infrastructure was introduced in previously merged PR: https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/37964.  The new models have different input features, requiring a more robust approach to determining the shapes of tensors to be sent to the model hosting servers.  I introduce a scheme to read the preprocessing json files for the models to determine how many of the features are particle flow candidates (pf), secondary vertices (sv), or the newly introduced lost tracks (lt).\r\n\r\nTagging @kpedro88 @yongbinfeng @violatingcp  \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nOutputs of models have been checked locally to match with non-SONIC version of models.  I also followed the pre-PR instructions here: https://cms-sw.github.io/PRWorkflow.html.  Some tests failed due to xrootd issues, which are not related to this PR as far as I can tell.\r\n\r\nThere will be dependency on a PR in the RecoBTag-Combined repository.  Once I make that PR, I will comment on this one\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "comments": 0, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1698428669", "deletions": 11, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_3_X", "number": 43138, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Updating SONIC ParticleNet Producer and Config Files", "updated_at": "1698428688", "user": "wpmccormack"}

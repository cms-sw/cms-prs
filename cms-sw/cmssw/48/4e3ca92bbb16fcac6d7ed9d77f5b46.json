The existing code indeed could destruct the `task_group` while it was still being used in an `task_arena::enqueue()`'d task. This PR fixes the synchronization problem in the test.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested on `el8_ppc64le_gcc11` on top of `CMSSW_13_0_0_pre4` on a Power 9 node.", "branch": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1677221418", "comments": 14, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1677189349", "deletions": 14, "labels": ["fully-signed", "tests-approved", "bug-fix", "orp-approved", "backport-ok", "heterogeneous-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "40a449d61e0a3c84914c25c374d88275cc9e158f", "merged_at": "1677221418", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "number": 40864, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix synchronization in ContextState test [13.0.x]", "updated_at": "1677221418", "user": "fwyzard"}

This PR introduces an updated tracker alignment [1] and a purely technical payload [2]. It re-synchronizes `auto:phase1_2021_realistic` with the GT used for the Run-3 studies, `106X_mcRun3_2021_realistic_v3`.\r\n\r\nIt would be useful to have this PR merged to avoid spurious differences in comparison tests in future PRs that affect `phase1_2021_realistic` conditions, for example, the eventual 10_6_X backport of #27644.\r\n\r\nGT diff with respect to current autoCond:\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/106X_upgrade2021_realistic_v8/106X_upgrade2021_realistic_v9\r\n\r\nGT diff with respect to GT for Run-3 studies:\r\nhttps://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/106X_mcRun3_2021_realistic_v3/106X_upgrade2021_realistic_v9\r\n\r\nThe tag difference above corresponds to payloads that were introduced by PR #27203 and ignored for Run-3 scenarios in a subsequent commit to that PR.\r\n\r\n[1] https://indico.cern.ch/event/831067/contributions/3485251/attachments/1871918/3080764/Run3Alignment_AlcaDB017_AdeWit.pdf \r\n[2] https://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/106X_upgrade2021_realistic_v8/106X_upgrade2021_realistic_v9\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nPayload validation can be found in [1] and [2]. In addition, `runTheMatrix.py -l 11624.0` was executed as a technical test.\r\n\r\n[1] https://indico.cern.ch/event/831067/contributions/3485251/attachments/1871918/3080764/Run3Alignment_AlcaDB017_AdeWit.pdf \r\n[2] https://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/106X_upgrade2021_realistic_v8/106X_upgrade2021_realistic_v9\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\n\r\nThis is not a backport per se but PR #27441 introduced into 11_0_X the tracker alignment payload used in this PR. But it introduced other changes as well; only the changes needed for consistency with existing 10_6_X workflows are used here.\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1566996773", "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1564535735", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["alca-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "65bba1af79492f994d8fc093613e08317cb793cd", "merged_at": "1566996773", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 27651, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Update tracker alignment for 2021 realistic scenario", "updated_at": "1566996773", "user": "christopheralanwest"}

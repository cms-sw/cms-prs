Matrix tests of this PR ongoing - we do not expect failures and will update this description when tests are finished.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.\r\n\r\nThis PR is a backport of #38726 to 12_4_X, introduces deepTauID v2p5 to nanoAOD v10.", "branch": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "changed_files": 6, "comments": 1, "commits": 17, "created_at": "1657883422", "deletions": 123, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "xpog-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 38751, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "DeepTau v2p5 in nanoAOD [12_4_X]", "updated_at": "1657883447", "user": "mbluj"}

This should have been done already in #17170, but somehow I missed it.\r\n\r\nThe `PixelTracksL2Tau_cfi` (*) referenced `TrackingRegionsFromBeamSpotAndL2Tau` (in pre-#17170 way), so I added `TrackingRegionsFromBeamSpotAndL2TauEDProducer` to produce the `TrackingRegion`s to event as required by the new seeding framework. I'm not sure how useful `PixelTracksL2Tau_cfi` is anymore though, as now it has just a clone of `PixelTracksProducer` and a `TrackingRegionsFromBeamSpotAndL2TauEDProducer` module via import (i.e. hit doublet/triplet/quadruplet producers and filter+fitter+cleaner are missing).\r\n\r\n(*) I guess this is being used for ConfDB parsing since it was modified in #17438. \r\n\r\nTested in 9_0_0_pre3, no changes expected.\r\n\r\n@rovere @VinInn @Martin-Grunewald ", "branch": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1486797262", "comments": 11, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1486635501", "deletions": 16, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "hlt-approved", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "5bb5a5d9098e4c616daeeacba59f32136445556f", "merged_at": "1486797262", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "number": 17470, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix pixelTracks imports", "updated_at": "1486797262", "user": "makortel"}

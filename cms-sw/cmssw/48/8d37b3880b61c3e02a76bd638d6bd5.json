More information can be found in this presentation: https://indico.cern.ch/event/792362/contributions/3299414/attachments/1791002/2917852/190205_Lowette_SIMPSimulation.pdf\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis code has been validated, among other things, by showing this SIMP simulation at 1GeV to give identical results to a simulation with a real Geant neutron replacing the SIMP. More information also in the talk mentioned above.\r\n\r\nNote that this code has so far only been used to simulate a signal in 7_1_X, thus the initial PR  in this branch. Next, it will be forward-ported to 10_6_X.\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "changed_files": 22, "closed_at": "1580115884", "comments": 38, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1551913885", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "c8c7b618cefc2f73c80a617356bfdd37f7743382", "merged_at": "1580115884", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "number": 26094, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Simps to customphysics 7 1", "updated_at": "1580115885", "user": "lowette"}

For this reason, it will be backported down to the `13_0_X` release cycle.\r\n\r\nFYI: @fwyzard\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nUnit tests of `DQM/HLTEvF` pass. The reproducer in #41512 does not crash if `\"ProductNotFound\"` is not added to `options.SkipEvent`.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

TypeWithDict::toType() was called, instead of the correct TypeWithDict::finalType().\n2) The code did not account for the fact that, for ROOT6, \"Long64_t\" has replaced \"long long\" as the normalized name of the \"long long\" data type, and the same for unsigned long long.\nNote:  This request fixes the observed errors, but it is unknown whether the relvals will pass with these fixes or will fail later for an unrelated reason.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_ROOT6_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1389763869", "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1389740391", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["db-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "21a140380136c51f26bc0c53e1a2cd133cd050b3", "merged_at": "1389763869", "merged_by": "ktf", "number": 2030, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix bugs in type resolution in conditions code", "updated_at": "1389995161", "user": "wmtan"}

But `hcalGlobalRecoSequence` is not included in `globalreco_tracking` that is run in \"trackingOnly\" workflows (it is in `globalreco` sequence right after `globalreco_tracking`).\n\nSimplest fix (proposed here) is to move `hcalGlobalRecoSequence` inside `globalreco_tracking` just before `vertexreco`. Limited matrix works, so I'd expect the change to not do any harm.\n\nTested in CMSSW_8_1_X_2016-10-09-2300, no changes expected in monitored quantities. Workflow 20824.1 works again.\n\n@rovere @VinInn @ebrondol @kpedro88 \n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1476226935", "comments": 12, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1476188054", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["bug-fix", "comparison-available", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "8eb491564cabedff44f57c9de02c7d1e37c14cfb", "merged_at": "1476226935", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 16170, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix trackingOnly workflows for phase2_hcal sub-era", "updated_at": "1476226935", "user": "makortel"}

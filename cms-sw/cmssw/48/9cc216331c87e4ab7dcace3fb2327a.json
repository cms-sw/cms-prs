However, they might be stored as `trigger::TriggerPhoton` as well as mentioned [here](https://hypernews.cern.ch/HyperNews/CMS/get/egamma-hlt/201/1.html). The pull request extends the plugins to deal with `trigger::TriggerPhoton` as well.\n\nFurther details and a validation of the changes are described in [these slides](https://indico.cern.ch/event/325987/contribution/5/material/slides/0.pdf).\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_2_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1404876124", "comments": 4, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1404729708", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "fully-signed", "hlt-approved", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "cba61df54483b12e52754b80372587f8d1b233da", "merged_at": "1404876124", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_2_X", "number": 4542, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix bug in cleaning of HLT jets against electrons", "updated_at": "1404876125", "user": "andrey-popov"}

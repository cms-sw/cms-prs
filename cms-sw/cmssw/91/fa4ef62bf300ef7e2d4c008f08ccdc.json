It does not really have one.  In ROOT6, this problem causes a unit tests failure.  In the CMSSW code for ROOT 5,  a public default constructor is declared (but not defined) for use by genreflex (CINT), but the compiler does not see one.  This doesn't cause any known problems at the moment, but is very bad practice.\nThis pull request gives LeafCandidate a real default constructor, and also provides commonality with the code in the ROOT6 IB.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1420825551", "comments": 4, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1420756504", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-available", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "99bd61d4c517c4166c756f45a609473a5122b929", "merged_at": "1420825551", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 7097, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 5, "state": "closed", "title": "LeafCandidate needs a default constructor", "updated_at": "1420827031", "user": "wmtan"}

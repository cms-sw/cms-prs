I have just gotten rid of uninitialized reads.\n  - confirmed with valgrind as fixed\n- HcalZDCMonitor counters initialized (cleans up occasional NANs in the plots)\n  - confirmed with valgrind as fixed\n- B2GDQM was missing initialization of semiE_LepJetPtCut (the default uninitialized value was between zero and any other value; it now becomes 30 GeV as desired in the config). Corresponding plots will change.\n  - confirmed with valgrind as fixed\n- EcalClusterLazyToolsBase had reads beyond vector size (should be harmless from the logic)\n  - confirmed with valgrind as fixed\n- patPFMETCorrections changes appear to be cosmetic\n  - the invalid read in SmearedJetProducerT calling StringCutObjectSelector still remains\n- changes in cscdqm::StripClusterFinder are towards cleaning of uninitialized values in StripClusterFitData::height_\n  - cleanup is not confirmed by valgrind\n\nTested in CMSSW_7_5_X_2015-09-06-2300 /test area sign584/: \n    - short matrix test comparisons show changes in affected plots in DQM\n    - reco products monitored with fwlite script are not affected\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 14, "closed_at": "1441647196", "comments": 0, "commits": 12, "created_at": "1441647189", "deletions": 84, "labels": [], "number": 11174, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": " cleanup of uninitialized reads reported by valgrind (backport of #11173 )", "updated_at": "1441647196", "user": "slava77"}

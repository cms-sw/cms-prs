Also the MC samples are already in proccess of being requested.\n\nSo it would be very nice to get it into CMSSW_7_4_X.\nThe same pull request will be done also for CMSSW 7_5_X.\n\nAny help is welcome.\n\nThanks,\nHauke\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1427459864", "comments": 20, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1426783286", "deletions": 26, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "9c060c5de9d1c0ddbbb3014f1760556cd227d555", "merged_at": "1427459864", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 8420, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "add castor lowPTjet trigger and reweight threshold via gain v2", "updated_at": "1427459864", "user": "cwohrman"}

The cumulative histogram BtlHitOccupancy was calculated and filled in BtlSimHitsValidation::endLuminosityBlock at step 3 and resulted not mergeable in the case of multiple parallel jobs. A new harvester module (BtlSimHitsHarvester) has been introduced and now the cumulative histogram filling is properly done at the harvesting step.\r\n\r\nIn addition, to deal with the huge number of BTL SIM/DIGI/RECO hits in the case of high PU events, the histograms with the number of hits are filled with the logarithm of the number of hits.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe updated code has been compiled in the release CMSSW_11_0_X_2019-08-21-2300 and tested with the WF 20434 and the WF 20607 with PU200.\r\n\r\nThe total size of the MTD monitoring plots is now:\r\n476.28 KiB MTD/ETL\r\n234.96 KiB MTD/BTL", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": "1567168076", "comments": 14, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1566991872", "deletions": 42, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "e5aaf0a5bfb90a62657c29d4abaa1c6677534653", "merged_at": "1567168076", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27891, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "BTL validation update", "updated_at": "1567168077", "user": "casarsa"}

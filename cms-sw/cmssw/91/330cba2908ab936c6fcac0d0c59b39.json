Could it be placed _e.g._ in `alpaka_common` namespace?\r\n    - [ ] @fwyzard: it should probably be moved to be a static variable in some kind of `getHost()` function\r\n  - [ ] replace the use of `std::cout` with the `MessageLogger`\r\n\r\nOngoing work by @ericcano and @fwyzard:\r\n  - [ ] make the `XyzId` structures match the macro-generated ones for a corresponding SoA\r\n  - [ ] add the `view` and `const_view` and pass those to the kernels", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 62, "comments": 87, "commits": 8, "created_at": "1651088372", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "new-package-pending", "code-checks-approved", "heterogeneous-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 37716, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 19, "state": "open", "title": "Test alpaka integration in CMSSW", "updated_at": "1653973192", "user": "fwyzard"}

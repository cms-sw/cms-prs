Could it be placed _e.g._ in `alpaka_common` namespace?\r\n    - [x] @fwyzard: it should probably be moved to be a static variable in some kind of `getHost()` function\r\n    - [x] for the time being I've settled on `alpaka_common::host()` \r\n  - [x] replace the use of `std::cout` with the `MessageLogger`\r\n  - [x] address `const` correctness with Alpaka buffers (see https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/37716#discussion_r888152966 and https://github.com/alpaka-group/alpaka/issues/1729)\r\n    - [x] this is now available as `alpaka::ViewConst<Buffer>`\r\n  - [ ] review the use of `beginStream()` and `endStream()`, because they can be called under unexpected conditions (see https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/37716#discussion_r888254868)\r\n    - [ ] to be done in a follow-up PR\r\n\r\nOngoing work by @ericcano and @fwyzard:\r\n  - [x] make the `XyzId` structures match the macro-generated ones for a corresponding SoA\r\n  - [x] add a `view` and pass that to the kernels\r\n  - [x] add a `const_view`\r\n    - [x] make a `view` automatically convertible to `const_view`\r\n  - [x] add an assignment to set all elements of a SoA \"row\" from a brace initialiser", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 48, "comments": 249, "commits": 11, "created_at": "1651088372", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "new-package-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved", "heterogeneous-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 37716, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 142, "state": "open", "title": "Integration of alpaka and macro-based SoA in CMSSW", "updated_at": "1658469064", "user": "fwyzard"}

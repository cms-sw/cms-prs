Could it be placed _e.g._ in `alpaka_common` namespace?\r\n    - [x] @fwyzard: it should probably be moved to be a static variable in some kind of `getHost()` function\r\n    - [ ] for the time being I've settled on `alpaka_common::host()` \r\n  - [x] replace the use of `std::cout` with the `MessageLogger`\r\n  - [ ] address `const` correctness with Alpaka buffers (see https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/37716#discussion_r888152966 and https://github.com/alpaka-group/alpaka/issues/1729)\r\n  - [ ] review the use of `beginStream()` and `endStream()`, because they can be called under unexpected conditions (see https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/37716#discussion_r888254868)\r\n\r\nOngoing work by @ericcano and @fwyzard:\r\n  - [x] make the `XyzId` structures match the macro-generated ones for a corresponding SoA\r\n  - [ ] add the `view` and `const_view` and pass those to the kernels\r\n\r\n---\r\nEdit: currently the file content actually look like\r\n```\r\nType                                  Module                 Label     Process         Full Name\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nPortableHostCollection<portabletest::TestSoALayoutT<128,false> >    \"testProducer\"         \"\"        \"Writer\"        128falseportabletestTestSoALayoutTPortableHostCollection_testProducer__Writer\r\nPortableHostCollection<portabletest::TestSoALayoutT<128,false> >    \"testProducerSerial\"   \"\"        \"Writer\"        128falseportabletestTestSoALayoutTPortableHostCollection_testProducerSerial__Writer\r\n```\r\nbut this may change as we improve the definition of the SoA templates and views.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 39, "comments": 132, "commits": 17, "created_at": "1651088372", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "new-package-pending", "code-checks-rejected", "heterogeneous-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 37716, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 66, "state": "open", "title": "Test alpaka integration in CMSSW", "updated_at": "1655471817", "user": "fwyzard"}

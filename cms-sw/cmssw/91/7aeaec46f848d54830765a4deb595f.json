It was checked that all newly added dependencies are actually required by the package with `git grep`.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 8, "closed_at": "1603349716", "comments": 17, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1602863886", "deletions": 9, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "db-approved", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "782571c772a8b1feb5af0a08efc6dd50787f66cd", "merged_at": "1603349716", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 31830, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "Clean more BuildFiles in some subsystems", "updated_at": "1603349717", "user": "guitargeek"}

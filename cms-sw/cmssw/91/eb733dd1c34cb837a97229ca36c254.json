Use separate flags for rechits to be excluded from seeding and those to be excluded from a cluster. These changes have very little impact in MC. In PbPb data, this should prevent fake photons being reconstructed from flagged rechits. In 2015, these were removed using offline selections. Flags to be excluded from seeding are chosen to be same as the ones from hybrid [1] and multi5x5 [2] clustering. Flags to excluded from clustering are chosen to match the ones for PF rechits [3],[4].\r\n\r\nNeeded for 2018 pbpb data. Tests pass workflows 150.1,2,3 and 158.\r\n@mandrenguyen, @bi-ran, @ikucher\r\n\r\n[1] : https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/RecoEcal/EgammaClusterProducers/python/hybridSuperClusters_cfi.py#L35-L39\r\n\r\n[2] : https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/RecoEcal/EgammaClusterProducers/python/multi5x5BasicClusters_cfi.py#L28-L33\r\n\r\n[3] : https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/RecoParticleFlow/PFClusterProducer/interface/PFRecHitQTests.h#L554-L572\r\n\r\n[4] : https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/RecoParticleFlow/PFClusterProducer/python/particleFlowRecHitECAL_cfi.py#L27-L29\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 8, "closed_at": "1537339758", "comments": 64, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1534954589", "deletions": 11, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "hlt-approved", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "6f98e4810fa97739d42b231fb24d50a9887e49ca", "merged_at": "1537339758", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_3_X", "number": 24365, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "island clustering can exclude flagged rechits", "updated_at": "1537339758", "user": "ttrk"}

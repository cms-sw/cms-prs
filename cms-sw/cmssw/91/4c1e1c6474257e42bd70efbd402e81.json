We distinguish the (a) Lower-level objects, which are inputs to (b) Higher-level objects that are (can be) used in the L1T Menu.\r\n\r\n(a) Lower-level objects:\r\n\r\n    l1ParticleFlow_calo_Task\r\n        pfClustersFromL1EGClusters ,\r\n        pfClustersFromCombinedCaloHCal ,\r\n        pfClustersFromCombinedCaloHF ,\r\n        pfClustersFromHGC3DClusters\r\n\r\n    l1ParticleFlow_pf_barrel_Task\r\n        pfTracksFromL1TracksBarrel ,\r\n        l1pfProducerBarrel\r\n\r\n    l1ParticleFlow_pf_hgcal_Task\r\n        pfTracksFromL1TracksHGCal ,\r\n        l1pfProducerHGCal ,\r\n        l1pfProducerHGCalNoTK\r\n\r\n    l1ParticleFlow_pf_hf_Task\r\n        l1pfProducerHF\r\n\r\n    Candidates\r\n        l1pfCandidates\r\n\r\n(b) Higher-level objects, that are (can be) used in the L1T Menu:\r\n\r\n    l1PFJetsTask\r\n        ak4PFL1Calo\r\n        ak4PFL1PF\r\n        ak4PFL1Puppi ,\r\n        ak4PFL1CaloCorrected\r\n        ak4PFL1PFCorrected\r\n        ak4PFL1PuppiCorrected\r\n\r\n    l1PFMets Task\r\n        l1PFMetCalo\r\n        l1PFMetPF\r\n        l1PFMetPuppi\r\n\r\nIn this PR, we use phase2_trackerV14 modifier to enable in the sequence the phase2 L1T modules that depend on TrackTriggerTracks. This solution effectively means that the central workflows earlier than era Phase2C9 will not execute these modules (neither will TrackTrigger TrackFinderTrack module)\r\n\r\nThe reason for this is that the Hybrid TrackTriggerTrackFinder at the moment cannot run on geometries earlier that Tracker v14, and are enabled via the same modifier only in eras Phase2C9 and later.\r\nStill to do\r\n\r\n    Add PF Taus (currently missing from this PR)\r\n    Add Phase1 PF jets which should reside in L1Trigger.L1CaloTrigger package\r\n\r\n# Phase1 PF jets\r\n# ########################################################################\r\nfrom L1Trigger.L1CaloTrigger.Phase1L1TJets_cff import *\r\n_phase2_siml1emulator.add(Phase1L1TJetsTask)\r\n\r\nHowever, in this ParticleFlow package we already have the jets ak4PFL1PuppiCorrected that could be used in principle. Although these were not used in the Menu of the L1T TDR, the two have a vary similar performance. The plan is, if possible to include the Phase1 PFJets is time permits, to be fully consistent with the L1T TDR.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 70, "closed_at": "1593759769", "comments": 29, "commits": 9, "created_at": "1593703308", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "l1-pending", "orp-approved", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "upgrade-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "9e8441dac7ded216e0a1b33d29ac0f969c299de9", "merged_at": "1593759769", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 30510, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "Phase2 L1 ParticleFlow ", "updated_at": "1593766346", "user": "silviodonato"}

In particular there are two main changes:\r\n> - Introduce a new Cleanup category to measure the resources used/freed between preClearEvent and postClearEvent. This time was previously assigned to overhead since the signals are called between the end of an Event and the beginning of the next one\r\n> - Add support for Transform signals called by heterogenous module consuming a portable collection needing a host-device transformation.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nTechnical change, no further validation other than the one performed for #50047\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

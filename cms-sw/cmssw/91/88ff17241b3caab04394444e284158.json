I noticed that in recent cosmic data these plots are almost all empty (see e.g.https://tinyurl.com/2q9tgomk). This was caused by a bug in the filling of the `MonitorElements` which is fixed in this PR.\r\nI profit of it to:\r\n   * modernize the code of the module\r\n   * introduce a `fillDescriptions` method and use it in the related configurations\r\n   * remove the `TrackSplitMonitor` from the Tracking DQM collisions setup as anyway there are no right input tracks to be fed to the module.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRun successfully `runTheMatrix.py -l 138.1 -t 4 -j 8 --custom_command='-n 5000' --ibeos` and checked that the cosmic plots are all filled.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nNot a backport, but needs to be backported to CMSSW_13_0_X for 2023 data-takging purposes.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 7, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1684180419", "deletions": 139, "labels": ["dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "bug-fix", "code-checks-approved", "tracking"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_2_X", "number": 41690, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Modernize `TrackSplittingMonitor` and fix bug with filling ME-s", "updated_at": "1684292806", "user": "mmusich"}

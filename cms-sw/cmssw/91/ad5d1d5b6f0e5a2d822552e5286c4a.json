I inadvertently neglected to implement the consumes interface for the less common case where the TrackerHitAssociator is constructed from hard coded values, rather than configured values. This PR implements the one ctor needed for this case.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1431517365", "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1431361533", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "fully-signed", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "c3d11f31cfe52a5b249cf77985cf9252aa0bc675", "merged_at": "1431517365", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 9041, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add consumes interface for default constructed TrackerHitAssociator", "updated_at": "1431867830", "user": "wmtan"}

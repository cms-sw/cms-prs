New parameters are used in the HLT Test Stand.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nBackport to 15_0_X is planned", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "comments": 1, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1757313857", "deletions": 49, "labels": ["daq-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 48859, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[DAQ] HLT test-stand conversion job patches", "updated_at": "1757313883", "user": "smorovic"}

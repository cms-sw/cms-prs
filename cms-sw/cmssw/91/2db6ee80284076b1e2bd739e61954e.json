As of now, and for data only, it was forcing loading of MagneticField_AutoFromDBCurrent_cff which anyhow points to the standard sequence.\r\n\r\nNote that the latter fix removes a meaningless warning message from ConfigBuilder.py as well.\r\n\r\nThese changes have been recently discussed in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/31651#discussion_r499124784\r\n\r\nNote: a significant number of instances of MagneticField_AutoFromDBCurrent_cff is still present in cfg files all around. A good fraction is being handled in #31788; others will be a subject of future PRs, before we can finally remove that cff.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nChanges are trivial; ie replacing obsolete sequences with others that load exactly the same field map.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 11, "closed_at": "1602853759", "comments": 13, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1602776481", "deletions": 30, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "operations-approved", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "7f18adc0821f4a055ac08472700a9efb964d09c2", "merged_at": "1602853759", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 31809, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "MF standard sequences cleanup", "updated_at": "1602853759", "user": "namapane"}

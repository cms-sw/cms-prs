This procedure was applied prior to jet clustering (akCs4PFJets), but not applied to the towering algorithm (PFTowers) that is used for the UE subtraction.   This leads to an inconsistency with our previous AOD-only workflow.  The cleaning is only effective occasionally such that the net effect is a small migration of in the jet pt spectrum.  \r\n11_2 backport is #32330. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nWfs 140.5611 and 158.01\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1606864868", "comments": 15, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1606651321", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "requires-external", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "4835701609ad9c838b61c6d8f7fa0526cf4f220a", "merged_at": "1606864867", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 32325, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Use cleaned PF candidates in UE subtraction in HI miniAOD", "updated_at": "1606864868", "user": "mandrenguyen"}

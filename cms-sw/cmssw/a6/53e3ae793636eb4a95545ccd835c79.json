To do this, I generated a trackingNtuple.root file and clustered it into jets. The trackingNtuple.root file is too large to upload here, but the code I used to create the jets is in reformat_jets.py and myjets.py. Currently, these files are configured to read in the usual ttbar sample.\r\n\r\nThose two files add six branches to the original trackingNtuple.root file. These branches are sim_etadiffs, sim_rjetdiffs, sim_rjet, sim_jet_eta, sim_jet_phi, and sim_jet_pt. The rjet branch is the most relevant here \"rjet\" is the eta-phi distance between a track and the center of the closest jet.\r\n\r\nIn order to create efficiency plots for this, I modified the existing LST files to include my branches. This mostly involved copying lines of code and changing the relevant branch names. In a few places, I have included cuts or edits to how the efficiency plots are produced. (Everywhere I have made a change I also added a comment to the effect of \"Added by Kasia\", but this was only so that I could find my own changes quickly when I need them.) The only change to the original LST output under this configuration is that if a track is not part of a jet, it is not included. However, if the input root file does not contain my six custom branches, LST will not compile. This pull request is mainly to demonstrate what I have done.\r\n\r\nHere is the indico link to the presentation I gave to the LST group on 3/18/25:\r\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/1496305/contributions/6303105/attachments/3034297/5358002/Jet%20Efficiencies.pdf\r\n\r\n\r\nPR validation:\r\n\r\nNo tests have been done since my edits interfere with the usual functioning of LST.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 11, "comments": 1, "commits": 10, "created_at": "1744302972", "deletions": 69, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending", "tracking"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 47842, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Modifying LST to create efficiency plots for jets", "updated_at": "1744302996", "user": "kk428"}

It skims more muons at GEN-SIM level, thus is more efficient to produce events similar to the ones we want to study. \nAfter discussing with @franzoni , it was agreed to include this configuration in RelVal workflows and ask for a RelVal based pre-production to perform a validation round before requestiong for a larger Cosmic production.\nJust the GEN fragment and the filter are included in this PR, eventual extension of the matrix should be taken care of by PdmV. \n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1434019037", "comments": 12, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1433496179", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "fully-signed", "generators-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "1a52e8fd72911476d4ccf8e192f86f8301cbe63a", "merged_at": "1434019037", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 9469, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Cosmic GEN configuration with tighter pointing cuts", "updated_at": "1476290236", "user": "battibass"}

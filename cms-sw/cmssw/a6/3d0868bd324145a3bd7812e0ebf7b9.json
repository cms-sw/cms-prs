(Note that there is no change in cosmic runs.) \nThe following modules are removed: \nTracking: \nregionalCosmicTracksSeq = regionalCosmicTrackerSeedingLayers \\* regionalCosmicTrackerSeeds \\* regionalCosmicCkfTrackCandidates \\* regionalCosmicTracks\nGlobal-muon reco: \nglobalCosmicMuons, globalCosmicMuons1Leg\nThe corresponding event content is also removed. \nThis is based on the configuration prepared by @bellan. The tracking changes were discussed and agreed on with @VinInn and @rovere. \n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1423121715", "comments": 9, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1422982596", "deletions": 46, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "operations-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "5a3c2f2ac09acef055bef3f34232af61ff3051f6", "merged_at": "1423121715", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 7541, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Clean up cosmic mu reco in pp", "updated_at": "1423121715", "user": "trocino"}

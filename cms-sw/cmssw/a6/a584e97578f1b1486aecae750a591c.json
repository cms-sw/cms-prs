This would allow the user to catch the configuration mistake and correct it. \r\nI add in this PR few unit tests (both `catch2` and from event data) for the novel functionality.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRun `scram b runtests` \r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nThis PR is not a backport. Backport can be discussed if desired.\r\n\r\nCc:\r\n@francescobrivio ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "comments": 7, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1722334682", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "alca-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved", "tracking"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 45589, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 19, "state": "open", "title": "Introduce `BeamSpotCompatibilityChecker` and corresponding tests", "updated_at": "1722405231", "user": "mmusich"}

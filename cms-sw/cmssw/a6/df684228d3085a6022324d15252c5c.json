Over 500 CMSSW macros do not compile in ROOT6. Since that is too many macros to be fixed centrally, it was decided by David Lange to centrally fix only those 45 macros with compilation errors that have been modified since the switch over to git, since those are the ones most likely to be used. Five of these 45 macros are in CommonTools (both Reco and Analysis L2 categories).  This pull request fixes them.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1429220178", "comments": 10, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1428953486", "deletions": 35, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "9334828732d66623b9b887ae3c8bd57a03ab9797", "merged_at": "1429220178", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 8713, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Macros need to compile in ROOT6 (CommonTools)", "updated_at": "1431031561", "user": "wmtan"}

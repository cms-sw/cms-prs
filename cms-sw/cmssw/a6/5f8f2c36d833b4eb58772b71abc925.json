In addition, information on decay-modes of generated taus is added to the genTauJets using the `status` flag. The decay-modes are codded following Tau POG standard (as defined in `DataFormats/TauReco/interface/PFTau.h`), while for undecayed (or others with abnormal decay-mode) taus the status is a negative number.\r\n \r\nBackport of #41064 & #41092.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nValidated during integration of original PRs #41064 & #41092, and revalidated with wf's 10024.0 & 148.0\r\n\r\n#### Backport PR\r\n\r\nIt is backport of #41064 & #41092 to production releases of 13_0_X series for 2023.", "branch": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 3, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1679310790", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-started", "orp-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "number": 41104, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Build genTauJets for undecayed taus and add tau decay-mode to genTauJets [13_0_X]", "updated_at": "1679406924", "user": "mbluj"}

This patch was tested on a T0 VM which hit this\nissue.\n\nRecursion is used (so bind-mounts-that-have-bind-mounts are OK);\npatch includes cycle detection (although I'm not sure how one can\nform a cycle, but I hate infinite recursion).\n\nSending a PR to 7_3_X per request from Dirk; this should be merged through 7_4_X and 7_5_X also.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_3_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1429699612", "comments": 22, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1429625873", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "tests-rejected"], "merge_commit_sha": "a36acd741b3a547ebff018f3f153c519cd226410", "merged_at": "1429699612", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_3_X", "number": 8813, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Allow local file system detection to handle bind mounts.", "updated_at": "1429791423", "user": "bbockelm"}

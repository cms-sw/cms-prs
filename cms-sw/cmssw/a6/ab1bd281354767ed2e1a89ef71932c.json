The already existing folders inside HLT/BTV will contain PNET input plots instead of DeepJet.\r\n2. For each path, we now have a separate '*_DeepJet' folder that contains plots with DeepJet inputs (note: some paths malfunction with PNET, so they only contain DeepJet folders)\r\n3. The histograms with name effic_bjetCSV now have appropriate titles and x-axis labels for both PNET and DeepJet. \r\n\r\n**PR Validation**\r\n\r\nThe changes pass the basic tests suggested in https://cms-sw.github.io/PRWorkflow.html. \r\n12834.0 workflow runs without error and all the changes are visible in local GUI. \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 6, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1713292553", "deletions": 10, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 44754, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Adding PNET scores to offline HLT DQM", "updated_at": "1713368360", "user": "aniketkhanal"}

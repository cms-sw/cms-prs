This sequence is implemented so that it may be run at Tier-0 with the tag ```@miniAODDQMBTagOnly``` monitoring of bTag DQM quantities on Tier-0 datasets. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe PR was validated by running a T0 wrapper for the DQM sequence with the new ```@miniAODDQMBTagOnly``` tag. The output was inspected to verify that the relevant bTag histograms were correctly produced in the resulting DQM file. \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1755780823", "comments": 14, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1753706958", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "d4b363f732a7ab178a28e1329c2e32b7018101fe", "merged_at": "1755780823", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 48638, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "added new miniAODDQMBtagOnly sequence to OfflineDQM", "updated_at": "1755780824", "user": "felix-phy"}

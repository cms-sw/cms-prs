This sequence is implemented so that it may be run at Tier-0 with the tag ```@miniAODDQMBTagOnly``` monitoring of bTag DQM quantities on Tier-0 datasets. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe PR was validated by running a T0 wrapper for the DQM sequence with the new ```@miniAODDQMBTagOnly``` tag. The output was inspected to verify that the relevant bTag histograms were correctly produced in the resulting DQM file. \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 4, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1753706958", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 48638, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "added new miniAODDQMBtagOnly sequence to OfflineDQM", "updated_at": "1753953005", "user": "felix-phy"}

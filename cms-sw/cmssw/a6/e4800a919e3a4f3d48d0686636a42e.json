The problem was noticed in the IBs after that pull request was merged. It didn't show up in earlier tests. This should fix the problem with the message \"no ServiceRegistry has been set for this thread\".\r\n\r\nNote that a second problem with the symptom of a seg fault also showed up rarely after that PR was merged. This probably will not fix that. We are still working on a fix for that one.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis is a non-reproducible problem that does not show up every time so I am not 100% sure this will fix it. We should merge it and see what happens in the IBs.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1665081036", "comments": 25, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1665005323", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "bug-fix", "urgent", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_6_X", "number": 39644, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Bug fix, start Services in runOrQueueEventSetupForInstanceAsync", "updated_at": "1665081036", "user": "wddgit"}

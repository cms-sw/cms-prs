This PR takes care of that (will be more robust once we get eras working), originally in #7726 \n\nFinally, now that the new GT are made available, a new b-tagger can be switched on without crashing the reco sequence, this was also discussed in the merged #7542.\nNote that the change in `PhysicsTools/PatAlgos/python/producersLayer1/jetProducer_cfi.py` will be crashing some of the PAT tests, because the new tagger is not yet included in the RelVals (a similar issue was discussed in #7678); originally in #7697 \n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 11, "closed_at": "1423895441", "comments": 8, "commits": 14, "created_at": "1423854650", "deletions": 224, "labels": ["alca-pending", "analysis-pending", "comparison-pending", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-pending", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "14ee83aca65c9138174911e3baaa11a49e2c0977", "merged_at": "1423895441", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 7732, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "New set of RelVal GT with updated conditions for Run2 MC DIGI-RECO and new PF calibrations; fix of Hcal digis for fastsim; switching on CSV+SL tagger", "updated_at": "1423895442", "user": "diguida"}

The main reason for this is that PUPPI treats particles with fromPV1&2 different than CHS.  It was found that PUPPI rejects one prong hadronic taus that most of the time has `fromPV==2` and `pT < 20 GeV` (`pT > 20 GeV` are protected by PUPPI already). This PR is supposed to recover the loss of hadronic tau candidates by keeping charged particles with `pT > 4 GeV` and `fromPV==2` while maintaining the jet energy resolution, eff and purity for jets. A comparison of different options was done in this presentation: https://indico.cern.ch/event/1364503/#5-puppi-tau-tune\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\npasses the usual runTheMatrix test: `runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos`\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

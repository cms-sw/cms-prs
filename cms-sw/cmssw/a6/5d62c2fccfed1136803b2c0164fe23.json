Code now allows the \n  user to pick specific rechit collections to dump, also all status bits (including \n  newly added ones) can be dumped with arbitrary order.\n\nHcalRecHitDump_cfg.py (new file) -- example config which shows how\n    to dump HBHE rechits using identical format for both Phase 1\n    and legacy reconstruction. Of course, the dumped info is\n    incomplete because we can only compare features that coincide.\n\nnumcompare.tcl (new file) -- Poor man's \"diff\" replacement which knows how\n    to compare doubles up to certain precision. This code assumes\n    that compared files have the same number of lines.\n\nprint_lines.tcl (new file) -- A simple utility for picking specified lines from\n    text files.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1476315735", "comments": 35, "commits": 17, "created_at": "1475583106", "deletions": 67, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved", "urgent"], "merge_commit_sha": "7bf580adc463ed08980ce5004682d1867b919bdc", "merged_at": "1476315735", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 16089, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 5, "state": "closed", "title": "Fixes and enhancements on HCAL rechit dumper", "updated_at": "1476315735", "user": "halilg"}

This is far preferable to adding switches throughout the code to handle the DetId type changes in the new geometry.\r\n\r\nattn:\r\n@bsunanda - I propagated this change to the testbeam code, is it acceptable?\r\n@jbsauvan - I propagated this change to the L1T code, let me know if it interferes with anything (hopefully not, just a straightforward changing of types).\r\n\r\nFollowup:\r\nIn order to facilitate reading the old digi types from existing samples to rerun reco/validation sequences, a \"dummy\" unpacker was added for HGCal, with output type `hgcalDigis`. The unpacker module can be swapped out with a converter that changes the digi types, using the process modifier `convertHGCalDigisReco`.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, to rerun digi/L1 sequences, an `EDAlias` was added for the simulated digis, `simHGCalUnsuppressedDigis`. This `EDAlias` can be swapped out with the same converter module using the process modifier `convertHGCalDigisSim`.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 67, "closed_at": "1531547616", "comments": 69, "commits": 19, "created_at": "1530134131", "deletions": 373, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "operations-approved", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "905af02d3369428df677c232537da6fca8982ff3", "merged_at": "1531547616", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 23703, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 12, "state": "closed", "title": "Simplify digi types for HGCal, add dummy unpacker and aliases", "updated_at": "1531547616", "user": "kpedro88"}

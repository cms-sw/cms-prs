This is far preferable to adding switches throughout the code to handle the DetId type changes in the new geometry.\r\n\r\nattn:\r\n@bsunanda - I propagated this change to the testbeam code, is it acceptable?\r\n@jbsauvan - I propagated this change to the L1T code, let me know if it interferes with anything (hopefully not, just a straightforward changing of types).\r\n\r\nFollowup:\r\nIn order to facilitate reading the old digi types from existing samples, a \"dummy\" unpacker was added for HGCal. The unpacker module can be swapped out with a converter that changes the digi types, using the process modifier `convertHGCalDigis`.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 59, "comments": 22, "commits": 11, "created_at": "1530134131", "deletions": 363, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-notrun", "dqm-pending", "l1-pending", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "tests-rejected", "upgrade-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 23703, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 10, "state": "open", "title": "Simplify digi types for HGCal, add dummy unpacker", "updated_at": "1530604350", "user": "kpedro88"}

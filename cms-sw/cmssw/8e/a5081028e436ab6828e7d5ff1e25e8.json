With the old implementation if a hit was belonging to more than 1 region it was added multiple times in the collection. Given the size of the L1 regions the overlap is mainly reduced to their boundaries so the artificial increase of energy is observed in the PFClusters used to compute Ecal Isolation rather than in SuperClusters (checked to be ~the same).\n\nCompared online and offline Sum(PFClusters_Et) around HLT candidates (in dr<0.3). The fraction of events in Zee  with (E_online-E_offline)/E_offline > 15% is:\nwith bug 8%;\nwith bug-fix ~1%.\n\nThe bug is affecting just HLT reconstruction, the filter is not used anywhere else.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1425656539", "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1425598527", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "hlt-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "b5bdd9348670919a67382de676bf69b2c340fabc", "merged_at": "1425656539", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 8109, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "fix rechitinregions", "updated_at": "1432835856", "user": "matteosan1"}

An example of how this new space will be useful is by hosting a series of new EGamma producers and algorithms that will take as input phase two objects, such as tracksters rather than calo clusters. We believe that duplicating and modifying the current chain of modules, rather than adding options and templating the current modules, is going to be easier and cleaner. The new directories are for the moment empty, because a consistent work of creating such new modules has not been carried out yet. On the other hand, we could rapidly start to fill them up once this PR is merged, as there are other open PRs that contain parts of code which could be nicely accommodated there.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis compiles and passes validation workflows with no differences at reconstruction level.\r\n\r\n@valsdav @felicepantaleo @AuroraPerego ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 102, "comments": 19, "commits": 12, "created_at": "1749822577", "deletions": 207, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "dqm-pending", "visualization-approved", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "new-package-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-rejected", "changes-dataformats"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_0_X", "number": 48319, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Add directories for TICL-EGM code development", "updated_at": "1757484270", "user": "RSalvatico"}

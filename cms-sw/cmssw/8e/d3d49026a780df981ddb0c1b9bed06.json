Apparently LLVM is pickier about the locality of pragma simd, as moving the directive to the loops that are actually optimized by gcc allowed LLVM to vectorize successfully.\r\n\r\nPR also adds constexpr to a few if statements on config constants.\r\n\r\nResolves https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/43886\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCompiles with no warnings with clang and gcc.

Most of such cases are filtered out (per affected readout) by the unpacker, when there is a corresponding error flag set by BE.  But it was found in Run3 data that there were _very rare_ occurrences of the issue without the error flag set.  This filter is intended for selecting/scanning already taken data for further studies.   \r\n\r\nIn parallel, (a development of) the relevant filtering at the entrance of the HCAL reconstruction is being considered.  \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nNB:  this is a standalone filter not included in any wf.  \r\n\r\nTested by simple injection of manually altered Digi (to exactly mimic stuckADC data):   \r\n%MSG-w HBHEstuckADCfilter:  HBHEstuckADCfilter:stuckADCfilter  12-May-2024 07:49:34 CEST Run: 1 Event: 1\r\nstuck ADC = 111 in  (HE 22,39,4)\r\n\r\nOutput file (events_list_stuckADC.txt) does contain a simple list of affected events in the from **run:lumi:event** \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1715491829", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 44955, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "HBHE stuck ADC filter", "updated_at": "1715491857", "user": "abdoulline"}

One `SubtractionSolid` `EFAW` is left as a mother volume intentionally in the hierarchy. This helps to restrict the number of volumes for a ROOT overlap check and complete it within a reasonable time.\r\n \r\n<img width=\"1269\" alt=\"Screenshot 2021-04-06 at 13 18 57\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1390682/113703157-bba32400-96da-11eb-9780-7f9f40aa2cef.png\">\r\n\r\nThe main source of 36 overlaps for both DD and DD4hep-based EcalBarrel geometry was a rounding error.

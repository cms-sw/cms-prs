This is an accident waiting to happen.  The implementation of endRun and endLuminosityBlock do not change current functionality, but make the code more maintainable.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_3_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1416514881", "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1416503525", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "37b1248aa047e5fe2d0713e2082d6f14db810eb9", "merged_at": "1416514881", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_3_X", "number": 6513, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "fix beginLuminosityBlock, and add endLuminosityBlock and endRun", "updated_at": "1416862898", "user": "wmtan"}

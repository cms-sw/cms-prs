The addition to the event content has been discussed in todays XPOG meeting (*). Usual tests have been applied without any occurence of showstoppers so far. \n\nOnce this PR is also integrated successfully the plan is close in time to backport it to 80X to have this essential additions to the miniAOD event content available from the 80X RERECO campaign.   \n\nCheers,\nRoger\n\n(*)\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/565391/\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1473222131", "comments": 13, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1473160535", "deletions": 41, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "648c1ae847fc551074ab50ccc0bae072fb843b34", "merged_at": "1473222131", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 15747, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 6, "state": "closed", "title": "Extension of PAT TauPFEssential event content to be able to run anti-electron discriminators in miniAOD input", "updated_at": "1473321652", "user": "roger-wolf"}

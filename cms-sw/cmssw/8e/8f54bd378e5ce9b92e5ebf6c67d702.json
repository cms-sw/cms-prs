In my previous PR, I added a functionality to automate the waiting times between different iterations. This is now also added to the MC workflow. (c06ca14)\r\n\r\n2. In macros/DrawIteration.C and macros/DrawPlot.C, there were several instances of 0 being used instead of nullptr. This is fixed now. Previously, using DrawPlot.C caused a Segmentation Fault when exiting the program. This is also fixed. (fc79c15)\r\n\r\n3. The used EDAnalyzers in plugins/ are now multi-threading-aware. (e287898)\r\n\r\n4. Instead of using a custom TTRHBuilder, now the WithAngleAndTemplate TTRHBuilder is used by default. (866f818)\r\n\r\n5. This is the biggest change. A tool was added to create trees which contain custom APE values. These trees can be used for comparison plots in the APE tool. Previously, this was only possible using a workaround. The EDAnalyzer code contains code snippets from both plugins/ApeEstimator.cc and plugins/ApeEstimatorSummary.cc.

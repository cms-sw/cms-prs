The problem was a cache internal to edm::AssociationVector was not getting cleared on each event. An ioread rule was added for the class, however it appears there is a bug in ROOT which prevents this rule from being used.\n\nThis pull request sets up unit tests for edm::AssociationVector to prove it works properly in the full framework. There is also a commented out test for reading in pyroot which can be used to test any fixes in ROOT for the problem.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_3_X", "changed_files": 9, "closed_at": "1412155764", "comments": 7, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1412105319", "deletions": 27, "labels": ["comparison-available", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "5164cf56efb67342a8eefee0fb1de4d1c35508e3", "merged_at": "1412155764", "merged_by": "nclopezo", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_3_X", "number": 5631, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Attempt to fix dictionary for edm::AssociationVector", "updated_at": "1412169684", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

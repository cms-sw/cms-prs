This was a waste of time since code was always checking the validity of the edm::Handle and therefore the exceptions were never thrown. \n\nThis code has the edm::Handle hold a functor which can create the exception if that exception is actually going to be used. igprof measurements have shown this to be faster than constructing the exception.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 27, "closed_at": "1385682479", "comments": 20, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1385575742", "deletions": 149, "labels": ["core-approved", "hlt-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "visualization-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_7_0_0_pre9", "number": 1613, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "edm::Handle holds functor for exception construction", "updated_at": "1386019696", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

Although strictly speaking it is a bug fix, it is not important unless someone tries to seriously use MTD in D49 or D60 in 11_3_X (which should be considered as obsolete). The net effect of the fix is anyway minor, it is mostly meant to avoid confusion in the future.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nVerified in 12_0_X.", "branch": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1620643862", "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1620374905", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["backport-ok", "bug-fix", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "62f739589efb0ca0d66d45b110bf1842d429b506", "merged_at": "1620643862", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 33657, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "[backport] MTD geometry: update mtdParameters for D49 and D60 (Bug fix)", "updated_at": "1620643862", "user": "fabiocos"}

Once that these new files will be available in _cms-data_, we will proceed with the coherent update of these files.\r\nThe current version of the updated L1 Menu is [L1Menu_Collisions2022_v0_1_6](https://github.com/cms-l1-dpg/L1MenuRun3/tree/master/preliminary/L1Menu_Collisions2022_v0_1_6).\r\n\r\nIn the context of the trigger studies for the preparation of the Run 3 menu (L1+HLT), we recently faced an issue related to the emulation of the L1 prescales. Two different issues were found out:\r\n- format of the PS table (some documentation and a recipe can be found [here](https://github.com/cms-l1-dpg/L1MenuRun3/tree/master/preliminary/L1Menu_Collisions2022_v0_1_6/PrescaleTable));\r\n- usage of the fractional PS ([PR#37046](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/37046)).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nBasic tests performed successfully starting from CMSSW_12_3_X_2022-03-01-1100.\r\nFrom CMSSW_12_3_X_2022-03-01-1100/src:\r\n> scram b distclean \r\n> git cms-checkdeps -a -A\r\n> scram b -j 8\r\n> scram b runtests\r\n> scram build code-checks\r\n> scram build code-format\r\n> runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 0, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1646345636", "deletions": 9, "labels": ["l1-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 37138, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Update of L1 prescales and masks files coherent with the latest L1 menu for Run 3", "updated_at": "1646345654", "user": "elfontan"}

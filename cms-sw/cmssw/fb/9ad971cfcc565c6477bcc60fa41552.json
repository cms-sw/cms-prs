(but for candidates with equal score)\r\n\r\nIt should also be noticed that the final sorting is not required and indeed in groupedLimitedCandidates there is NO final sort.\r\n\r\nWe also  Reduced the Size of TempTrajectory to speed up move and swap.\r\nTook the opportunity to reduce the size of Trajectory as well.\r\nand to cleanup  general CkfTrajectoryBuilder code.\r\n\r\nIn a HLT menu\r\ntime of limitedCandidates improves of 20%\r\nwhile the one of groupedLimitedCandidates improves of a bit more of 10%\r\n\r\nHLT throughput improves of a solid 1.5% at least.\r\n\r\nPurely technical.

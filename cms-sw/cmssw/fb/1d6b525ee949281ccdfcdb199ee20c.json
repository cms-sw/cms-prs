The `std::isinf` -> `edm::isNotFinite` may result small regression in code using TwoTrackMinimumDistanceHelixHelix, otherwise no regression is expected. I didn't see any changes in my tests. Short matrix works.\n\n@rovere @VinInn \n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 37, "closed_at": "1425462217", "comments": 21, "commits": 10, "created_at": "1425040330", "deletions": 279, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "feb7d4dc932a16a6bec2a68f597feb399a8ccab0", "merged_at": "1425462217", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 7983, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix issues reported by static analyzer in tracking related code", "updated_at": "1476956216", "user": "makortel"}

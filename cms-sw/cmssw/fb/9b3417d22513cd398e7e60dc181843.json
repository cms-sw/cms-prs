This also creates a separate index file which says where in the merge file each individual file is located.\r\n- Extend DD4Hep_MagGeoBuilder to be able to use either the merged file (if present) or the individual files\r\n- Use of the merged file decreased the setup time from 9 seconds to less than 2 seconds on my test machine.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n- Running the unit tests in MagneticField/Engine pass both with and without the index file being present\r\n- Used GridFileReader to dump the contents of the interpolation file with and without the index. The two files chosen gave identical dumped information.\r\n \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 30, "comments": 17, "commits": 10, "created_at": "1653323676", "deletions": 276, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 38051, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "open", "title": "Be able to use merged magnetic field interpolation files", "updated_at": "1654099054", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

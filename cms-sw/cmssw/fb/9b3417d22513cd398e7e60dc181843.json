This also creates a separate index file which says where in the merge file each individual file is located.\r\n- Extend DD4Hep_MagGeoBuilder to be able to use either the merged file (if present) or the individual files\r\n- Use of the merged file decreased the setup time from 9 seconds to less than 2 seconds on my test machine.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n- Running the unit tests in MagneticField/Engine pass both with and without the index file being present\r\n- Used GridFileReader to dump the contents of the interpolation file with and without the index. The two files chosen gave identical dumped information.\r\n \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 30, "closed_at": "1654347156", "comments": 22, "commits": 10, "created_at": "1653323676", "deletions": 276, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "51e5a9aa88f9d1e73c0d53c5036897f4298a8f63", "merged_at": "1654347156", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 38051, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "Be able to use merged magnetic field interpolation files", "updated_at": "1654347156", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

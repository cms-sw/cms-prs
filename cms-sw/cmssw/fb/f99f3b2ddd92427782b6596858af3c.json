Also, std::make_unique is used when appropriate. Also, there was a case where a reference to an auto_ptr was an input argument to a function, which is a bad practice because it obscures the possible transfer of ownership. In the cases here, ownership was transferred, so the  unique_ptr was passed by value.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 115, "closed_at": "1474003099", "comments": 10, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1473877246", "deletions": 403, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "hlt-approved", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "62f955aea14ba0b0011438fc9cc196d458f1c812", "merged_at": "1474003099", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 15857, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Use unique_ptr, not auto_ptr in RecoEgamma and RecoEcal", "updated_at": "1474290532", "user": "wmtan"}

This happens also if the parameter skipBadFiles is set to True. In previous versions (CMSSW 10.6) this parameter enabled to run on corrupted or non-existing files without leading to a crash. \r\n\r\nThis has been fixed in CMSSW 11.3 by https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/32373 \r\n\r\nThe present PR is a minimal fix, inspired by the latter, in order to restore the behaviour of skipBadFiles in CMSSW 11.1. (Initially a private fix, but might be useful to other people who need to run in CMSSW 11.1 due compatibility with older files.)  \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe test carried out was to run on a collection of files containing missing files, and making sure the code does not terminate by a segmentation violation. \r\n\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1637012668", "comments": 6, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1636924322", "deletions": 10, "labels": ["core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "e1c36755304f813539533354630615d86c4cfe27", "merged_at": "1637012668", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 36123, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Restore behaviour of skipBadFiles for non-existing files", "updated_at": "1637012668", "user": "mhuwiler"}

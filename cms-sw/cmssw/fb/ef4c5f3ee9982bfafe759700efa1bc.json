In order to do so:\r\n- I introduced a new `run3_nanoAOD_ANY` modifier (any feedback on whether this is done properly is appreciated)\r\n- Additionally, I cleaned up some commented lines (referring to `LHCInfo`) in `SiPixelStatusHarvester.cc` and `CTPPSDiamondDQMSource.cc`.\r\n\r\nRelated topics/PRs:\r\n- Partially addressing the issue in https://github.com/cms-AlCaDB/AlCaTools/issues/87.\r\n- Similar to https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/42515, https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/42890 and https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/43951\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nCode compiles, plus I successfully run few nano matrix tests (`runTheMatrix.py -l 2500.31,2500.012 --ibeos -j 16`).\r\n\r\nChanges expected from this PR:\r\n - none in the Run 2 workflows\r\n - possibly some in the Run3 workflows, given that they have been consuming not-correct payloads so far (although AFAIK only PPS experts are interested in such information)\r\n \r\n#### Backport:\r\nA 140X backport will be provided once this PR is converged. \r\n\r\n-----\r\nFYI  @vavati @JanChyczynski @grzanka @Glitchmin", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "comments": 1, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1707857168", "deletions": 19, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "alca-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending", "xpog-pending", "trk"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 43956, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Update LHCInfoProducer to use LHCInfoCombined", "updated_at": "1707857195", "user": "francescobrivio"}

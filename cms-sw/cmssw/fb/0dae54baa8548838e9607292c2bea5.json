So we would like to be able to change the clusterizer without interfering with the code in use for current/phase1 detector.\n\nThe new collection is included in the phase2 workflows but  for the moment no rechits are produced out of it. \n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 25, "closed_at": "1469002939", "comments": 60, "commits": 15, "created_at": "1465935864", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "6b2703421ab04e431648987dc910f6e8a2db590c", "merged_at": "1469002939", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 14885, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "Add phase2 Inner Tracker (IT) pixel cluster to cmssw 81X from new IB", "updated_at": "1469016533", "user": "emiglior"}

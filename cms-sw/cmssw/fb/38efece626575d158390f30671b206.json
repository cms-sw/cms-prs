The photon pt cut, photon eta cut, isolation cone size, and isolation cut are configurable.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI have run this producer on a recent TTBar and HGG relval sample, and found that the producer produces the expected number of isolated photons in each case.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/28371\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1575996038", "comments": 12, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1573836056", "deletions": 10, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "generators-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved", "xpog-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "c45808a41a934bc6598bdded36c052f5b54f3fd8", "merged_at": "1575996038", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 28409, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "102X backport of isolated particle level photons", "updated_at": "1575996038", "user": "AndrewLevin"}

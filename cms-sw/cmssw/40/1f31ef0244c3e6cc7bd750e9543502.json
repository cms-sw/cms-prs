In links [1] and [2] are presented performance results with the new AMv2 algorithm :\r\n\r\n- In simulation with the emulator\r\n\r\n- Comparing emulator and firmware in the laboratory\r\n\r\n- Similar (or even improved) performance w.r.t. previous AM version (v1, already in CMSSW)\r\n\r\n[1] https://indico.cern.ch/event/1262475/contributions/5308462/attachments/2607937/4505149/230309_NewAM_DTUpgrade_JLH.pdf\r\n[2] https://indico.cern.ch/event/1263362/contributions/5305755/attachments/2607489/4504221/230308_NewAM_L1MuonDPG_JLH.pdf\r\n\r\n[3] https://github.com/jaimeleonh/cmssw/tree/AM_12_4_2_new_fitter\r\n[4] https://github.com/jfernan2/cmssw/tree/AM_12_4_2_new_fitter_withThetas\r\n\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

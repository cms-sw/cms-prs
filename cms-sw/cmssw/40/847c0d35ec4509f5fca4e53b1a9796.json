See also #13393\n- Location and naming of the residual histograms for SiPixel is improved\n- Cuts on pT and dxy significance are applied for all residuals. Such cuts were missing in the original SiStrip version. The histograms are now closer to the old SiPixel residuals histograms.\n- The source code now compiles into two modules to keep the configrations of SiPixel and SiStrip independent.\n- Some other cleanup.\n\nThese changes affect the configuration options for the TrackMonitorTrack module. I updated the config files as far as I could follow; however, the new SiPixelMonitorTrackResiduals might be added in more places. Also, some files use options that were probably broken before, i did not touch these.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 11, "closed_at": "1458202713", "comments": 24, "commits": 13, "created_at": "1455870910", "deletions": 176, "labels": ["alca-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "a16601f155a34b18cbea0b491b234e187cfcf39e", "merged_at": "1458202713", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 13404, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "DQM TrackerMonitorTrack improvements (80X version)", "updated_at": "1458202713", "user": "schneiml"}

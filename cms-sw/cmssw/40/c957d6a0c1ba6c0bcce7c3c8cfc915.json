The definitions of the plots is similar to what we have for tracks in MultiTrackValidator. There are separate plots for cases when a reco vertex matches to one sim vertex and when it matches to many sim vertices (merged).\n\nIn addition, the following bugs are fixed\n- Filling of KindOfSignalPV histogram when the signal PV is not the one with largest sum(pT^2)\n  - Related to this, the setting of the `kind_of_signal_vertex` was simplified (in a separate commit to make it easier to verify that the results don't change)\n- Setting the DQM folder for `process.postProcessorHLTvertexing`\n  - In practice this affected only the standalone running of the `postProcessorVertexStandalone` sequence. In production workflows the `process.postProcessorVertex` did the post-processing for HLT, and `process.postProcessorHLTvertexing` did the post-processing for offline.\n\nThe first fix results the following change in 25ns RelValTTbar (9k events) (black old, red new)\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/33993/6437586/1ff8b3e4-c0c1-11e4-9e11-1cd123855384.png)\ni.e. events migrate from the bin `!Highest!Assoc2Any` to `!HighestAssoc2First` and `!HighestAssoc2!First`.\n\nTested in CMSSW_7_5_X_2015-02-25-1400.\n\n@rovere @VinInn \n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1425397651", "comments": 10, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1425289088", "deletions": 10, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "afc51b88155c1679be451936cb0fb4e8883aaced", "merged_at": "1425397651", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 8009, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add resolution and pull plots to vertex validation, and fix two bugs", "updated_at": "1476956219", "user": "makortel"}

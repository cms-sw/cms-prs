This includes a check in `BXVector::push_back` that only includes the data if it is between `bxFirst_` and `bxLast_`, a `LogWarning` with some info is issued otherwise (I could remove that if complicating the buildfile and includes is undesirable). @perrotta you requested a fix like this.\r\n\r\n### PR validation:\r\n\r\nAll code compiles and has had formatting and code checks done.

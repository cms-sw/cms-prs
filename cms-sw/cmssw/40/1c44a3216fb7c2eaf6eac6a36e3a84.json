For D66, this change didn't affect the muon reconstruction. In D67, we now see that gem rechits from GE0 are used by muons.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with any link to  -->\r\n\r\nBefore submitting your pull requests, make sure you followed this checklist:\r\n- verify that the PR is really intended for the chosen branch\r\n- verify that changes follow [CMS Naming, Coding, And Style Rules](http://cms-sw.github.io/cms_coding_rules.html)\r\n- verify that the PR passes the basic test procedure suggested in the [CMSSW PR instructions](https://cms-sw.github.io/PRWorkflow.html)\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1608851340", "comments": 26, "commits": 12, "created_at": "1608008098", "deletions": 84, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "bf306a66982fae34396e97fc45c61a3a556adfec", "merged_at": "1608851340", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 32490, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 10, "state": "closed", "title": "Build GE0 in the Muon Reco Geometry", "updated_at": "1608851340", "user": "seulgi324"}

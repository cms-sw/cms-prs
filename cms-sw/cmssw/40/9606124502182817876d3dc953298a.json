This is motivated by the fact that a vector of `CombinationsWithBxInCond` (which is equal to `std::pair<short,int>` ) is a data member of the `GlobalObjectMap` class (which in turn is used in `GlobalObjectMapRecord`, one of the data formats used in the RAW data tier).\r\nhttps://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/bf4d4fe891e7d94189bb86054451336cfba119c9/DataFormats/L1TGlobal/interface/GlobalObjectMap.h#L111\r\n\r\nThe creation of these dictionaries was missed in #47030, and it likely led to the problem described in #47287.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

The reason for this is that in the Muon unpacker and uGMT emulator the step size for unconstrained pT was 0.5 GeV (as it is for standard pT), however in firmware it is actually 1 GeV. This PR fixes the discrepancy in both the unpacker and emulator.\r\n\r\nThis should also go in for the next MWGR in March and therefore assume I should make a backport, but please confirm. (attn @rekovic)\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI have locally run the DQM on a streamer file taken last week and verified correctness.\r\n\r\nBackport 11_2_X: https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/32913", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1613577246", "comments": 17, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1613223703", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved", "urgent"], "merge_commit_sha": "f91490fd5861333c9be8b8a0ce74eb7816cb2d11", "merged_at": "1613577246", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 32906, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Correct muon unconstrained pT scale", "updated_at": "1613577263", "user": "dinyar"}

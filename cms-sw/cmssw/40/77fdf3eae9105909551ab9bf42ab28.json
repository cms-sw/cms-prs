The default will transfer the blob without to read it.\n- Implement an 'overriding' option for the import, allowing to ovverride the existing iovs of the concerned sequence interval, to make only the imported iovs active.\n- Implement a 'forceInsert' option for the import, to allow the change of tags with synchronization else then any or validation ( will be possible only by the conddb admins anyhow )\n- allow to provide the 'editingNote' which will be stored in the TagLog entry for the concerned change.\n- provide a conddb_edit_tag command for general management of the Tag header, allowing to change the synchronization. It also allow to create new Tags without iovs.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 15, "closed_at": "1464261952", "comments": 10, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1464174274", "deletions": 206, "labels": ["comparison-available", "db-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "cd10f46bf00bd374510a4a16165742bee48f6615", "merged_at": "1464261952", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 14633, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Several improvements for the conddb tools", "updated_at": "1464333916", "user": "ggovi"}

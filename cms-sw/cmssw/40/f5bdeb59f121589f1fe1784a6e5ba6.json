Also, std::make_unique is used when appropriate. Also, there were a few cases where a reference to an auto_ptr was an input argument to a function, which is a bad practice because it obscures the possible transfer of ownership. In the cases here, ownership was not transferred, so the object itself was passed by reference.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 30, "closed_at": "1472708809", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1472439883", "deletions": 158, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "4c64c983ef9afbb7dcb517ff0d41a1448d9b06b5", "merged_at": "1472708809", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 15635, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Use unique_ptr, not auto_ptr in RecoLocalTracker", "updated_at": "1472948353", "user": "wmtan"}

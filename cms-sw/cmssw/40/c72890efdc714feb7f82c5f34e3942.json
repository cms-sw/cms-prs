It also upgrades us to the new tracking framework for seeding. \r\n\r\nHowever for RECO, no changes are expected currently. So there should not be a single change observed from this PR. \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 13, "closed_at": "1493991269", "comments": 30, "commits": 19, "created_at": "1493724605", "deletions": 177, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "hlt-approved", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "3955a88d295f5db884edf80f508981583b3c36c8", "merged_at": "1493991269", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_2_X", "number": 18541, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 19, "state": "closed", "title": "New E/g HLT Pixel Matching : 92X", "updated_at": "1493991269", "user": "Sam-Harper"}

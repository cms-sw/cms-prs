This causes thread safety issues. This change\nconverts the Managers to use factories instead so each caller gets\ntheir own copy. This also solved a memory leak problem in the client\ncode where sometimes the shared code got the object from a Manager\nand sometimes it got it from calling clone(). In the clone() case\nthe object was never deleted. Now the object is always deleted.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "changed_files": 10, "closed_at": "1398794902", "comments": 10, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1398551055", "deletions": 57, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "43f6f0980628787d002e75fa9f1d18245c0f1a5f", "merged_at": "1398794902", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_1_0_pre8", "number": 3530, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "No longer share global objects from RecoVertex/ConfigurableVertexReco", "updated_at": "1399391527", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

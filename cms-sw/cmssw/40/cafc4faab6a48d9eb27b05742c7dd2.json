It was observed that the Digitized signal gets lowered and correspondingly #  Digis are lower than expected in inner Pixel layers . It was found that this is due to the fact that the Dual-Slope signal scaling is used. It is now fixed using simple liner scaling of charge during the first step  of Pre-Mixing.  \r\n\r\n  - Changes are NOT expected! As shown in the validation plots, the PreMixing and noPreMixing show similar behaviour as expected.  \r\n  - NO other PRs or externals it depends upon it\r\n  - The details of the code change and the validation results are reported to Tk Phase2 Simulation group [Link](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1321219/contributions/5602295/attachments/2726551/4738571/Phase2TrackerDigi_PreMixing_Validation_29092023.pdf)\r\n  \r\n@emiglior \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1696350421", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["simulation-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-approved", "trk"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_3_X", "number": 42938, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "open", "title": "Update of Phase2 Tracker Digitizer to fix an issue in Premixing", "updated_at": "1696411059", "user": "suchandradutta"}

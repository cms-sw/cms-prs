Krtschmer, as well as the performance studies: \nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/277448/material/slides/0?contribId=3\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/316122/contribution/3/material/slides/0.pdf. \nIn few words, the cut on the number of pixel layers is loosened from >1 to >0, the transverse and longitudinal impact parameter cuts are tightened from 3cm to 0.3cm and from 30cm to 20cm, respectively, and the cut on the track chi^2 is replaced by a requirement for the track to be high-purity. \nThe change does not have any effect at reconstruction level. \n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_3_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1414561957", "comments": 7, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1414443623", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "7a4a148d4273dedd2956b30001e38b9be34e00b4", "merged_at": "1414561957", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_3_X", "number": 6032, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "New SoftMuon ID selector", "updated_at": "1414561958", "user": "trocino"}

If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nNot a backport, but a backport to CMSSW_12_4_X is needed.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1657611180", "deletions": 204, "labels": ["alca-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "bug-fix", "code-checks-approved", "trk"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 38700, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "`SiPixelLorentzAnglePCLHarvester`: fetch precise B-field value from map via `inverseBzAtOriginInGeV`", "updated_at": "1657612929", "user": "mmusich"}

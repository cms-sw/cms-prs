If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nNot a backport, but a backport to CMSSW_12_4_X is needed.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1657629393", "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1657611180", "deletions": 204, "labels": ["alca-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "bug-fix", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved", "trk"], "merge_commit_sha": "bf84f5a873d0af0f58f08a8c0f29652208144b24", "merged_at": "1657629393", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 38700, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "`SiPixelLorentzAnglePCLHarvester`: fetch precise B-field value from map via `inverseBzAtOriginInGeV`", "updated_at": "1657629394", "user": "mmusich"}

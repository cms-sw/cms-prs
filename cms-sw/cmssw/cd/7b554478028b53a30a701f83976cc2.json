In this filter a match between L1 muons before and after different filters is performed. Currently the code expects the muons that are compared to be in the same collection. However, there are use cases in the current menu where the matching is performed with a copy of the L1 muon collection and thus always fails. This causes an inefficiency for low pT muons that are reconstructed only by L1-seeded reconstruction steps. Impact is mostly negligible, showing tiny efficiency improvements for high-pT muon from the Z:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4459228/156228489-1a576146-f76e-46e5-a827-44b0524644ba.png)\r\n\r\nEffect gets more visible for lower pT muons, for example in the turnon of the double-muon trigger:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4459228/156228543-8bee4a1b-d947-43bf-96a4-67b547c1e05b.png)\r\n\r\nHowever, the effect is significant for very low pT leptons. For the muon Bs -> mumu trigger (HLT_DoubleMu4_3_Bs_v14) we find a ~20% improvement of HLT efficiency on a sample of signal events provided by BPH.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 16, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1646156254", "deletions": 9, "labels": ["hlt-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "bug-fix", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 37110, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 10, "state": "open", "title": "fix L1 candidate matching in HLTMuonL1TFilter", "updated_at": "1646225436", "user": "JanFSchulte"}

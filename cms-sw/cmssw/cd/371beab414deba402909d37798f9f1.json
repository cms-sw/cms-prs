The problem should be specific modules run in scheduled mode (i.e. modules are in Path or Sequence). Given that in all offline workflows the reconstruction code is run unscheduled, I limited to modules that I saw were in `HLT_GRun_cff`. I might have missed some, but I hope these changes would reduce the rate of the failures.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nNone", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 8, "closed_at": "1661496757", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1661450339", "deletions": 11, "labels": ["hlt-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "c7686e8bd5ee8f7ab6b313706b6b47805e075308", "merged_at": "1661496756", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 39201, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Declare production of Track collection after TrackExtra collection in modules run at HLT", "updated_at": "1661496757", "user": "makortel"}

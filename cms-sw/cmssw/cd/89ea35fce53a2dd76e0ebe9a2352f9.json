I am working on a generator feature that requires modifying a lot of config files, so it will make life much easier if these obsolete config files that cannot possibly be used are removed from the release.\nNote 1:  This PR removes about 5400 lines of unusable code from the release!\nNote 2: This PR should not be confused with #10030 (already merged), which removed a different set of obsolete config files.\nNote 3: The original version of this PR mistakenly removed 17 additional files, that, while they did use obsolete sequences, the obsolete sequence was removed only three months ago. So this PR no longer deletes those 17 files.  Thanks to Slava for catching this.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 54, "closed_at": "1436963154", "comments": 24, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1436470082", "deletions": 5390, "labels": ["alca-pending", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fastsim-approved", "generators-pending", "geometry-approved", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "270ef605278e1359cfc5a65cdcec4960cd5f3f92", "merged_at": "1436963154", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 10116, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Remove some configuration files using nonexistent standard sequences", "updated_at": "1436966386", "user": "wmtan"}

The notable exceptions are the Muons paths for which more expert help is needed to perform this transition.\r\n\r\nThe `timing` variant of the menu has been updated to include the recent move to L1P2GT and converted to using sequences as well.\r\n\r\nSome of the `pset` configurations have been included in the PR even if they contain 0 changes. This is due to how the tool `edmConfigSplit` internally dumps those `pset`s. Rather than chasing all of them one by one, I decided to let it do its job.\r\n\r\nUnused modules have been removed. If needed, they could be extracted from git.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRun before/after this PR on some 100 events and the results are identical.\r\n\r\nAll paths have been tested one-by-one to verify that they could run alone, w/o any other paths present.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 430, "comments": 42, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1708417651", "deletions": 6353, "labels": ["hlt-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 44025, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Sequence-based simplified HLT phase2 menu.", "updated_at": "1709742675", "user": "rovere"}

Useful for determining how much time elapsed between the last message logged and the stack trace.\r\n\r\nI did check the length of pidString_, and it shouldn't need any expansion to accommodate the additional characters.\r\n\r\nWhile we could call time() in the signal handler to get a more immediate timestamp, there are no async-signal safe functions for formatting a time stamp.  Running the 'date' command is not as precise, but much easier.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1538494431", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_3_X", "number": 24792, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "print date before executing gdb", "updated_at": "1538497130", "user": "dan131riley"}

However, I only add noPU workflows as I was waiting for GEN-SIM input for the mixing workflows. \r\nNow that exists, so this PR adds the mixing ones. \r\nTurns out there was a typo in a parameter in the gen fragments which I fixed as well. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested with new wfs 320, 321, 322\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nNo backport needed.\r\nWould be cool to squeeze this in 13_2_0_pre2 though, if still possible.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please delete the text above after you verified all points of the checklist  -->\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1687281659", "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1686821993", "deletions": 20, "labels": ["generators-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "pdmv-approved", "orp-approved", "upgrade-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "59535a5f570187f27cc91dd937fd69a790c487b1", "merged_at": "1687281659", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_13_2_X", "number": 41971, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add HI mixing wfs for 2023 MC", "updated_at": "1687281660", "user": "mandrenguyen"}

We would like to keep the Run2 IDs. Therefore, I have added a new branch for Run3 ID that is called \"cutBasedRunIIIWinter22\". So we have two branches for the electron cut based IDs, \"cutBased\" branch which is for Run2 IDs and \"cutBasedRunIIIWinter22\" which for run3 IDs. I have also added the corresponding bitmap branch.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know your comments.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nReza\r\n\r\n@swagata87 @a-kapoor  @DebabrataBhowmik ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "comments": 7, "commits": 9, "created_at": "1666683890", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "xpog-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_6_X", "number": 39839, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Run iii electron cut based", "updated_at": "1666693842", "user": "rgoldouz"}

This is done by including `genPUProtons`-EDProducer via ProcessModifier in `Digi_cff`.\r\n\r\nOn the same go, this PR moves also the removal of `muonDigiTask` and `addPileupInfo` into `Digi_cff` where the original Tasks are defined.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nLimited matrix runs, `edmConfigDump 250202.181*/step3*py` does not contain `process.None` anymore.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1571248733", "comments": 15, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1571155789", "deletions": 16, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "operations-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "ecb6ae442f861de634532aa318ee240bad2a950b", "merged_at": "1571248733", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 28181, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Improve the treatment of genPUProtons in premix stage2 configuration", "updated_at": "1571248733", "user": "makortel"}

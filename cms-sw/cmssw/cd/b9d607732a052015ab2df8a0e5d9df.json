This is useful to make PR more robust against single cell inefficiency and to remove duplicate tracksters.\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis PR was tested with 20490.0_SingleGammaPt25Eta1p7_2p7 checking that the number of hgcalLayerClusters fed to the pattern recognition is halved, and that the number of duplicate tracksters is decreased. \r\nAnother PR will be made in order to make the Pattern Recognition by CA more robust as well.\r\n\r\n@rovere @cseez @amartelli fyi ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1565241088", "comments": 12, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1564664977", "deletions": 11, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "f29a2e05ed2f279b25e499948dc4c38f8e92d009", "merged_at": "1565241088", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27666, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "HGCal - Minimum Cluster size for Pattern Recognition", "updated_at": "1565241089", "user": "felicepantaleo"}

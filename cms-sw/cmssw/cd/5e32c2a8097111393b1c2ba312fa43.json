That\r\nwas due to a declaration without any implementation of a trackster's\r\nmethod. This removes that.\r\n\r\n* Make use of the topology information, in the form of 9 floats for each\r\nDetId, to pass HGCAL specific information to Fireworks. This will avoid\r\nthe weak and error-prone practice of unpacking the DetId bits while\r\nrendering the objects via the dedicated proxies. Three floats are still\r\navailable. This will increase the coupling between the release, the\r\ngeometry dumping and the explored file. On the other hand, at present,\r\nthe unpacking is wrong for new geometries.\r\n\r\n* Rename private variables with a final '_', in accordance to CMSSW coding\r\nrules. Also, make use of the topology information now stored inside the\r\ngeometry description of Fireworks. This makes the code easier to read\r\nand maintain. Finally, make Trackster-as-layer fully heatmap compatible.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nusual `runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all`\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "comments": 0, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1633511759", "deletions": 144, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "visualization-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "number": 35558, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Improve HGCAL geometry handling in fireworks", "updated_at": "1633511862", "user": "rovere"}

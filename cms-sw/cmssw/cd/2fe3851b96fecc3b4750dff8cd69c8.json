The algorithm at present is applied on the SiStripCluster but we plan to extend the algorithm to work also on the Approximated clusters. \r\n\r\nFrom first test we see it is possible to save ~40% of the tracker event size using this approach. \r\nThe PR at present is intended to share the code and receive comment. In particular we would need to know how to deal with the externals and if adding an extra package with a dedicated producer for compression is a viable solution. In principle the code could be added directly to the SiStripClusterizer package. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe code was tested locally producing compressed clusters. In the test folder two .py configuration files can be used to run the code. Not yet clear on how to deal with the externals. Locally it has been used: scramv1 setup RecoLocalTracker/SiStripDataCompressor/test/tool.xml\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 17, "closed_at": "1623749330", "comments": 26, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1620738221", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["code-checks-rejected", "new-package-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-rejected", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "number": 33695, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 5, "state": "closed", "title": "SiStrip Cluster Compressor for HI", "updated_at": "1623749331", "user": "icali"}

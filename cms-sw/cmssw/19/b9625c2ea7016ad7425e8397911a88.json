Some additional minor improvements have been introduced. \r\nThese are the changes:\r\n\r\nIn SimFastTiming package:\r\n\r\n1. New digitizer for the BTL detector with the bar geometry:\r\n     - new BTLBarDeviceSim with readout at both sides of the crystal bar;\r\n     - BTLDeviceSim renamed to BTLTileDeviceSim;\r\n     - only the first two samples of the DataFrame are used, to store the two \r\n       charges and times read out.\r\n2. Improved the BTL pulse shape.\r\n3. Implemented a parametrization of the BTL time resolution from the test\r\n    beam results.\r\n\r\nIn RecoLocalFastTime package:   \r\n\r\n1. The BTLUncalibratedRecHit has been updated to produce and save hits for both crystal \r\n    readouts in the BTL bar geometry and a flag is set to keep track of different cases.\r\n2. The MTDRecHit producer has been updated to take into account all possible scenarios.\r\n\r\nIn order to have the proper digitizer selected, the Phase2_timing_layer_new era has\r\nbeen replaced with Phase2_timing_layer_tile and Phase2_timing_layer_bar.\r\n\r\nA minor issue with the GeographicalID in BTLDetId has been fixed.\r\n\r\nThis branch has been tested in all available MTD scenarios with SingleMuons (22407, 22807, \r\n26607, 27007, 27407), MinBias (22440, 22840, 26640, 27040, 27440), TTbar (22434, 22834, \r\n26634, 27034, 27434).\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 91, "comments": 3, "commits": 14, "created_at": "1543569629", "deletions": 3406, "labels": ["alca-pending", "code-checks-pending", "comparison-pending", "db-pending", "geometry-pending", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending", "upgrade-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_4_X", "number": 25384, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "MTD simulation: double readout of BTL crystal bars", "updated_at": "1543576714", "user": "casarsa"}

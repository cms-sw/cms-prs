Totally technical.\nIn RecoEgamma/EgammaTools/plugins, there were free function templates in different files that had the same signature. These were violations of the ODR (one definition rule).\nThe reason this problem had not yet been seen before is that the function templates in question are declared \"inline\". However, \"inline\" is only a suggestion to the compiler. When compiled in debug mode (-O0), in-lining was apparently turned off. This did not cause a link error, as function templates are not instantiated until run time. However, it caused the wrong function to be called in several cases, causing relvals 4.53, 135.4, and 1330.0 to fail.\nThis problem was previously fixed in CMSSW_7_5_X with PR #11069. However, since #11069 was\nmerged, another file was introduced into 7_5_X that has the same issue. This new PR makes the same fix to the in-line template free functions in this new file by nesting them inside an anonymous namespace.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1442426200", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1442338061", "deletions": 12, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "35debd415f9bede1198996a71f8b8792df7740d0", "merged_at": "1442426200", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 11263, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Use anonymous namespace to avoid duplicate symbols", "updated_at": "1442492869", "user": "wmtan"}

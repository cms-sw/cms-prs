PCL workflow for PCC correction computation on dedicated ALCARAW\r\n2. Prompt workflow for consumption of the corrections computed by PCL and creation of a new ALCARECO\r\n3. RelVal tests for all of the above (modified existing workflow 1020).\r\n4. ConfigDP scenario to run 1 and 2 @ Tier0\r\n5. equip ConfigDP tests to check the new workflow creation\r\n\r\n\r\nStill outstanding (but not a showstopper for integration) is the modification of the class https://github.com/cerminar/cmssw/blob/4ccc1b642378fb41911793a1f06a716d9d8c174f/Calibration/LumiAlCaRecoProducers/plugins/CorrPCCProducer.cc \r\nto produce DQM MEs. @samhiggie @capalmer85 this will need your action to be addressed.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 20, "closed_at": "1521731830", "comments": 68, "commits": 22, "created_at": "1520929871", "deletions": 139, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "operations-approved", "orp-approved", "pdmv-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "3bf90a20a5536ddf2971dc6a330aa4c0c5aebfc4", "merged_at": "1521731830", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_1_X", "number": 22590, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Integration of the new Lumi PCC workflow in PCL and Prompt-Reco", "updated_at": "1521731830", "user": "cerminar"}

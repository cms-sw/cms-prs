Also, integrating the V2 ID was not as trivial as expected as variables were ordered and defined slightly different compared to V1. For now, this was solved with branchings in the ElectronMVAEstimatorFall17 class.", "branch": "CMSSW_9_4_X", "changed_files": 50, "comments": 1, "commits": 11, "created_at": "1543907972", "deletions": 344, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_9_4_X", "number": 25408, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[9_4_X] Egamma Fall17 V2 IDs", "updated_at": "1543908039", "user": "guitargeek"}

For this reason, all value maps produced by the Egamma MVA machinery were validated [1]. As a reference, the most recent 10_4_X integration build was used for the Fall17 V2 MVAs and 9_4_12 for all other MVAs. All Egamma MVAs which can be possible configured in 9_4_X were validated, not only the ones activated in the MVAValueMapProducers.\r\n\r\nIntegrating the V2 electron MVA was not as trivial as expected as variables were ordered and defined slightly different compared to V1. For now, this was solved with branchings in the ElectronMVAEstimatorFall17 class.\r\n\r\n[1] https://rembserj.web.cern.ch/rembserj/plots/CMSSW_PRs/25408/", "branch": "CMSSW_9_4_X", "changed_files": 50, "comments": 3, "commits": 11, "created_at": "1543907972", "deletions": 344, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-started"], "milestone": "CMSSW_9_4_X", "number": 25408, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[9_4_X] Egamma Fall17 V2 IDs", "updated_at": "1543909728", "user": "guitargeek"}

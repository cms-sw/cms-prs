This function is replaced\nby new getEngine functions that take either a StreamID\nor a LuminosityBlockIndex as an argument. This comes\nafter a long migration of all clients to the new\ninterface. The new interace is designed to work with\nthe multithreaded Framework.\n\nNote this may cause some problems when automatically\nmerged from 7_1_X to 7_1_THREADED_X. There will be\na separate pull request to the 7_1_THREADED_X branch\nsoon after the automatic merge occurs which will\nresolve the problems and also delete the function\nentirely on that branch.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1394612500", "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1394558350", "deletions": 20, "labels": ["core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "818e0e0a5fefe41d3f67cecd460913def6881ec0", "merged_at": "1394612500", "merged_by": "nclopezo", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_1_0_pre5", "number": 2813, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Make getEngine() private in random service", "updated_at": "1398450019", "user": "wddgit"}

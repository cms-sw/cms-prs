The implementation (from @borzari) follows the suggestion here https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/45162#issuecomment-2154754787.\r\nI profit of this PR to refactor the track selection in `SingleLongTrackProducer` to avoid filling the `selTracks` with tracks without `reco::Track::Extra` attached to them. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n could run this test:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/4639c105a21c6934798c543c9a7cae72955c9369/DQM/TrackingMonitorSource/test/BuildFile.xml#L2\r\n\r\n(even using the whole input file) without crashes. \r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

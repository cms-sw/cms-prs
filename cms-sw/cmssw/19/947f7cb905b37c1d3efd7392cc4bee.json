The resolution of conflicts in several files was required. A rebase is required as soon as #33589 is integrated within a 10_6_X release. \r\n\r\nSome minor updates listed here https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/33992#issuecomment-856079949 have been forwarded ported to master in the PR #34005.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "changed_files": 18, "closed_at": "1623134935", "comments": 31, "commits": 9, "created_at": "1623013273", "deletions": 81, "labels": ["backport-ok", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved", "urgent", "xpog-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "d81c275987713029c317c7950db5398de5ae26b1", "merged_at": "1623134935", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 33992, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 7, "state": "closed", "title": "LowPtElectrons: NanoAOD integration (back port of #33817)", "updated_at": "1623134936", "user": "bainbrid"}

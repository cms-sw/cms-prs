This is to make sure that everything that _produces_ DQM histograms actually is known to the EDM framework as a _Producer_, even if the data still flows through the `DQMStore`; otherwise, we have no guarantees that modules will run in the correct order.\r\n\r\n- Some cleanup removing unused declarations in `DQMStore.h`, including `fastmatch`. The previous cleanup PRs left these unused.\r\n\r\nUpdate: some things went into #28612, removed here now.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe challenge with this PR is that `DQMGlobalEDAnalyzer`s are primarily used in HLT, and I am not sure how to test them there. For now, HLT configs should reliably crash due to the incorrect module type used in the auto-generated configs; I am not sure how to change this part of the code. Also `FastTimerService` and `ThroughputService` need to be checked. Let's see if any of that is picked up in the PR tests, else I'll have to defer that to the HLT experts.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 14, "closed_at": "1578511409", "comments": 83, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1573830474", "deletions": 259, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "hlt-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "a8d5c490780481e8a307b15f8dcf9df1ab17821a", "merged_at": "1578511409", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 28407, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "DQM: new DQMGlobalEDAnalyzer", "updated_at": "1578511409", "user": "schneiml"}

The update adds the Run-2 customisation for CTPPS. \r\n\r\nIt addresses issue #37483. It likely needs a backport to `12_3_X` to ease HLT development.\r\n\r\nThe function `CTPPSRun2Geometry` was not used anywhere, so I effectively moved it inside `customiseCTPPSFor2018Input`.\r\n\r\nThis PR does not affect any central wf, so no differences in the outputs of PR tests are expected.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nVerified that the warnings reported in #37483 are not present anymore.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nN/A", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1649570159", "deletions": 5, "labels": ["hlt-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 37518, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "add HLT customisation for Run-2 CTPPS", "updated_at": "1649570540", "user": "missirol"}

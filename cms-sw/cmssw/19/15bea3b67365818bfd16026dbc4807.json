This bugfix fixes very large (but not infinite) areas that stretches outside the HF by surrounding the event with \"mirror events\". This is to prevent rare instances, where FastJet would cluster negative pT particles over large distances, and a large, negative particle become a jet in the opposite direction.\n\nAlso, the printf() have been converted to EDM log messages.\n\nNo performance difference is expected, except for jets either at |eta| ~ 5, or rare events that previously would have contained unreasonably large jet pTs (e.g. 10 TeV).\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1447881398", "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1447776011", "deletions": 19, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "db56086c8f47a2ebd9bc79988cffec6b86c3a368", "merged_at": "1447881398", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 12464, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Apply a \"boundary condition\" at the outermost pseudorapidity edges", "updated_at": "1447881398", "user": "yslai"}

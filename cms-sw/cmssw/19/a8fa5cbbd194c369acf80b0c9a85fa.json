There's no reason for the Validation code to use `HcalTestNumbering` or `HcalDDDRecConstants` classes unless the actual layer information is needed.\r\n\r\nI couldn't figure out the source of the DQM printout (which was using `std::cout`), so I just commented it out. @deguio @vkhristenko please investigate when you have time.

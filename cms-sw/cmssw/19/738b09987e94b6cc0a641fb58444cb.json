These modules are minimally changed from the existing modules:\r\n\r\n- `RecoMuon/GlobalTrackingTools/interface/MuonTrackingRegionByPtBuilder.h` is updated from `RecoMuon/GlobalTrackingTools/interface/MuonTrackingRegionBuilder.h`\r\n- `RecoTracker/TkTrackingRegions/plugins/L1MuonSeededTrackingRegionsProducer.h` is updated from `RecoTracker/TkTrackingRegions/plugins/CandidateSeededTrackingRegionsProducer.h`\r\n\r\nInitial performance study was presented at the TSG meeting by @wonpoint4: https://indico.cern.ch/event/1131517/contributions/4751084/attachments/2396360/4097442/220223_TSG_MuonROI_wonjun.pdf\r\n\r\n- Significant efficiency gain at low pT, e.g. 75% to 95% at 4 GeV, with a cost of up to around 10 ms timing increase and O(10%) of rate increase for low-pT muon triggers (no significant impact on the total rates).\r\n- The final ROI parameter tuning (python configuration level changes) to balance between efficiency and timing/rates is ongoing.\r\n\r\nFYI: @JanFSchulte @wonpoint4", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "comments": 14, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1647857006", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 37286, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 29, "state": "open", "title": "pT dependent ROI producers for Muon HLT", "updated_at": "1648813702", "user": "khaosmos93"}

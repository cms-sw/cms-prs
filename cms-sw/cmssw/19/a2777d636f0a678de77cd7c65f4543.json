So, this is expected to be included only for the eras \"pp_on_AA_2018\" and \"pp_on_PbPb_run3\". It includes an EDProducer to create a \"packed pixel tracks collection\" (similar to \"lostTracks\" collection) using as input \"hiConformalPixelTracks\". The studies below was made in 103X, but in 112X we also did the test \"runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos\", in special workflow 159 that uses these commits.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/sl08rl1xw8a27xi/slides_MiniAOD_PixelTracks_v2.pdf?dl=0\r\n\r\nThe slides above show some description and comparison of the input collection vs new collection. The quality variables in slide 6 are expected to not match, since we used a less accurate covariance schema to save space. In addition, we added a pt cut of pt<1GeV/c, since in HI analyses using pixel tracks we only consider this pT range.\r\n\r\n@mandrenguyen @abaty\r\n\r\nBest Regards\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1594361835", "comments": 51, "commits": 19, "created_at": "1592579296", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "0526ff2b491777d33787695a5f263a65740b8697", "merged_at": "1594361835", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 30313, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 77, "state": "closed", "title": "Add Pixel Tracks in Heavy Ions MiniAOD", "updated_at": "1594361835", "user": "CesarBernardes"}

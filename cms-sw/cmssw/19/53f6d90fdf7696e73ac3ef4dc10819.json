This PR includes updates to the L1 tracking for HL-LHC. \r\n\r\nSimilar as the original PR, this PR must be coupled to, and tested with, the update in: cms-data/L1Trigger-TrackFindingTracklet#3. This update of data files were merged to master along with the original PR though, so I am not sure how it is handled from the central SW side? But that update is needed also for this backport.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nSame as #34215 \r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nSince HL-LHC L1 tracking/trigger studies still use the CMSSW_11_3_X series, we need it backported to here.  \r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "changed_files": 140, "closed_at": "1626082089", "comments": 5, "commits": 21, "created_at": "1625819572", "deletions": 6092, "labels": ["l1-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "requires-external", "tests-approved", "upgrade-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 34422, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Backport of \"Update L1 tracking for HL-LHC\"", "updated_at": "1626084512", "user": "skinnari"}

Instead, use a `ProcessCallGraph` to get the highest possible module id.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nWith these changes, adding the `NVProfilerService` to complex configurations (_e.g._ a full HLT menu) works, instead of failing with an assertion.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nTo be backported to 12.4.x and 12.5.x for data taking.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1663296947", "comments": 9, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1663233338", "deletions": 16, "labels": ["hlt-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "bug-fix", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved", "heterogeneous-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "b4f6076b7e9a88e767f37a113f7af13c08e0d325", "merged_at": "1663296947", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_6_X", "number": 39398, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix the `NVProfilerService` and `ProcessCallGraph`", "updated_at": "1663296947", "user": "fwyzard"}

No existing functionality is removed - the new EMP buffer file format is simply added as a new option. The new EMP framework version that requires this buffer format is already being used for firmware builds for the phase-2 L1T correlator, GTT and GT.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe following checks have been run on this code (beyond confirming that the code compiles):\r\n\r\n * Ran `scram b code-checks` and `scram b code-format`.\r\n * Ran `test/gtt/createFirmwareInputFiles_cfg.py` with format set to `EMPv2` and inspected output files to verify their format.\r\n * Ran `test/gtt/verifyFirmwareOutput_cfg.py` to confirm that the new test/gtt/example_*.txt files were parsed correctly\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 12, "comments": 2, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1684920826", "deletions": 45, "labels": ["l1-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_2_X", "number": 41768, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "L1T demonstrator tools: Support for EMP v0.7.x buffer file format", "updated_at": "1684921252", "user": "tswilliams"}

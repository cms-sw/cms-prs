This also didn't match the filenames which had the correct 1D and 2D names. This change is purely cosmetic, it does not change any functionality. \r\n\r\nThe changes have been tested on small local pixeltree jobs to ensure that the output is exactly the same.\r\n\r\n@pmaksim1  @perrotta @slava77 @fabiocos @makortel @tvami @tsusa @cmantill @schuetzepaul", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 7, "comments": 0, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1531768402", "deletions": 50, "labels": [], "number": 23805, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Fixed confusing naming scheme of Pixel template reco (2D vs. 3D)", "updated_at": "1531768496", "user": "OzAmram"}

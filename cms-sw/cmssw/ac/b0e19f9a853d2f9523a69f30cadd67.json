Unit tests to be restored when new relvals are available.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 85, "closed_at": "1441786817", "comments": 10, "commits": 19, "created_at": "1441352673", "deletions": 2700, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-available", "fastsim-approved", "geometry-approved", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "893decf40779629bf94758f3f2e4e26105cc9ee6", "merged_at": "1441786817", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 11121, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "Fastsim newrechits rebase sep4", "updated_at": "1441973193", "user": "lveldere"}

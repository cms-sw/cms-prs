Here good means \"gets E/gamma energy regresssions\". All electrons are automatically good, the problem is for photons, theres no way at the miniAOD level to know if you should apply the regression to it or not short of trying to do a tight p4 match with the original photon which is error prone.\r\n\r\nThis small change will greatly help E/gamma and JetMET understand the effects of the regression on jets + met as well as making it a lot easier to apply new energy corrections. Given the ongoing issues with E/gamma energy regression corrections, its extremely useful to have a clean way to re apply them at the miniAOD level. \r\n\r\nAs an aside, had this feature already been here, the regression PR would have already gone though as my bug was in trying to apply the regression on miniAOD packed candidates. \r\n\r\nI've already cleared this with XPOG. \r\n\r\nI have one more minor check to do in the morning ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1507978866", "comments": 27, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1507756234", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "orp-approved", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "b9ce77df2473dc90c1c511f677cb39a09e25c50d", "merged_at": "1507978866", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_4_X", "number": 20903, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "adding good e/gamma flag to PackedCandidate for MiniAOD", "updated_at": "1507978866", "user": "Sam-Harper"}

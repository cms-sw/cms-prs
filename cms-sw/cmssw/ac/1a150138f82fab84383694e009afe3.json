No noticeable changes to e/gamma objects.\n- correctly veto ID'd muons from becoming seeds for e/gamma objects\n- Fill the electron ID mva value for gedGsfElectrons, should show up in DQM now.\n\nThe cluster/linking related fixes improve low-side (i.e. below 0.5) tails in the E_reco/E_true distribution for refined superclusters coming from electrons.\n\nThe muon fix should significantly reduce the rate of high pT muons becoming electrons.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": "1384796951", "comments": 13, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1383908851", "deletions": 39, "labels": ["fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "8a2f0178fadc8df22d1a35d3ba265acb07b82086", "merged_at": "1384796951", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_0_0_pre9", "number": 1383, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 7, "state": "closed", "title": "bugfixes for PFEG: mustache conversions, GSF-SC associations, muons, mva-e-pi filling", "updated_at": "1384796951", "user": "lgray"}

This workflow has two advantages\r\n\r\n1. Memory copies are avoided\r\n2. The order of the MultiCollections is defined in one location (see [issue 48526](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/48526#issuecomment-3449942861) )\r\n\r\n**PR validation:**\r\n\r\nWorkflow 29688.0\r\n\r\n\r\nFYI @felicepantaleo @leobeltra", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 24, "comments": 29, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1760954645", "deletions": 219, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "dqm-pending", "core-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "changes-dataformats", "ngt"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_0_X", "number": 49190, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 14, "state": "open", "title": "Define MultiCollections for HGCRecHitCollection and PFRecHitCollection", "updated_at": "1761899598", "user": "Electricks94"}

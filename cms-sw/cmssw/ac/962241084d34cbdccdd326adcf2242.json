This class holds references to `Collections` and can create a MultiSpan from these in place. Since the `MultiCollection` is lightweight, holding only references, it can be passed to the event flow. It allows the collection of data from different producers and then the creation of a combined view in later producers. With this workflow, copies of the data to the combined data structures are not necessary anymore.\r\n\r\n\r\nFYI @felicepantaleo @leobeltra", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 226, "comments": 8, "commits": 11, "created_at": "1760954645", "deletions": 377, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "dqm-pending", "l1-pending", "hlt-pending", "core-pending", "alca-pending", "fastsim-pending", "db-pending", "generators-pending", "geometry-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "xpog-pending", "heterogeneous-pending", "tracking", "trk", "changes-dataformats"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_0_X", "number": 49190, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Add MultiCollection to create MultiSpans from a lightweight holder class", "updated_at": "1760957694", "user": "Electricks94"}

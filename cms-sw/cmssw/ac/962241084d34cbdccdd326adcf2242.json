This class holds references to `Collections` and can create a MultiSpan from these in place. Since the `MultiCollection` is lightweight, holding only references, it can be passed to the event flow. It allows the collection of data from different producers and then the creation of a combined view in later producers. With this workflow, copies of the data to the combined data structures are not necessary anymore.\r\n\r\n\r\nFYI @felicepantaleo @leobeltra", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 25, "comments": 16, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1760954645", "deletions": 219, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "dqm-pending", "core-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending", "changes-dataformats"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_0_X", "number": 49190, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 10, "state": "open", "title": "Add MultiCollection to create MultiSpans from a lightweight holder class", "updated_at": "1761769349", "user": "Electricks94"}

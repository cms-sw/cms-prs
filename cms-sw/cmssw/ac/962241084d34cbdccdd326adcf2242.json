Then `RefProdVector`s for `PFRecHitCollection` and `HGCRecHitCollection` are introduced as product of the `RecHitMapProducer` and comsumed by other producers to create a `MultiSpan` on the fly. This workflow has two advantages\r\n\r\n1. Memory copies are avoided\r\n2. The order of the Collections is defined in the RefProdVector at one location. Like this later producers can rely on the order (see [issue 48526](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/48526#issuecomment-3449942861) )\r\n\r\n**PR validation:**\r\n\r\nWorkflow 29688.0\r\n\r\n\r\nFYI @felicepantaleo @leobeltra", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 24, "closed_at": "1762961662", "comments": 39, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1760954645", "deletions": 219, "labels": ["core-approved", "dqm-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved", "changes-dataformats", "ngt"], "merge_commit_sha": "9aaf71d3ed00f7d4c109568b784d1f156520525e", "merged_at": "1762961662", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_16_0_X", "number": 49190, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 14, "state": "closed", "title": "Define RefProdVector for HGCRecHitCollection and PFRecHitCollection", "updated_at": "1762961664", "user": "Electricks94"}

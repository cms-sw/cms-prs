In addition, the pre-existing\nchecking for dictionaries of produced types, present types,\nand types selected for output is done in a more consistent\nway with better and more consistent error messages.\n\nThese changes rely on the ROOT function TClass::GetMissingDictionaries\nmore than the previous version. A design choice was to\nuse this instead of developing and maintaining CMS specific\ncode to look for dictionaries for all the constituents\nof a class. This ROOT function currently does not work as we\nexpect and as part of this effort we submitted bug report\nJIRA-8208 to the ROOT bug tracking system.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 20, "closed_at": "1467399051", "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1466002953", "deletions": 331, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "core-rejected", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-rejected"], "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 14896, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix bugs in code that detects missing ROOT dictionaries", "updated_at": "1482170657", "user": "wddgit"}

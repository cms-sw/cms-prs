The problem is that both `CSCDMBHeader` and `CSCDMBTrailer` have a `boost::shared_ptr` as their first member, and it makes no sense to overwrite those via a `memcpy`. These constructors are not called (anymore?) in CMSSW, and judging from the git history it looks like they could be leftovers from #4034. This PR suggests to remove these constructors.\r\n\r\nThis issue was found by GCC 9.\r\n\r\nIn addition this PR replaces the `boost::shared_ptr`'s with `std::shared_ptr` in these two classes, and makes the `dynamic_cast`s const-correct.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe code compiles without warnings with GCC 9.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1556564203", "comments": 12, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1556299444", "deletions": 26, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "d311c79f3b6016daea41e1ef676ea47c048b4950", "merged_at": "1556564203", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 26552, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Remove constructors taking CSCDMBStatusDigi from CSCDMBHeader and CSCDMBTrailer", "updated_at": "1556564203", "user": "makortel"}

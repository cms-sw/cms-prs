This will wait for when b=12 GEN-SIM has been produced in a pre-release relval.  \r\n\r\nThe validation and DQM sequences also had to be brought into sync with their pp Phase I equivalents. \r\nTo get these sequences to run I modified the heavy-ion HCAL local reco such that it now runs both hbheprereco and hbhereco, as is the case in pp.\r\nI'm not really sure why this was ever different in the first place though. \r\nFeedback on this would be appreciated. \r\n ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 34, "closed_at": "1496582318", "comments": 11, "commits": 28, "created_at": "1496260841", "deletions": 219, "labels": ["alca-pending", "analysis-pending", "comparison-pending", "dqm-pending", "generators-pending", "geometry-pending", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending", "upgrade-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_9_2_X", "number": 19053, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "Add Phase I heavy-ion relval workflows", "updated_at": "1496582318", "user": "mandrenguyen"}

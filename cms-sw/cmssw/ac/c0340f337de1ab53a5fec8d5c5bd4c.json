This was seen, for instance, in collisions run 275766, where the Emulation Quality continued to show YELLOW\n- To protect against these cases (without tightening the 5 sigma constraint), if threshold occupancy < 0, set threshold occupancy to 10.\n\nIn conjunction with 80X PR https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/14978.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1467095300", "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1466843417", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "f43d71694a40db627657f00c8dc073201fe76bfb", "merged_at": "1467095300", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 14979, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Protect against negative occupancy thresholds", "updated_at": "1467095300", "user": "mbandrews"}

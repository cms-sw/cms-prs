An occasional crash (less than 1% frequency) was observed in private tests. I determined the reason as follows: there can be cases where there are SimClusters but no RecHits. If the SimMapper does not create the corresponding PF clusters in those cases, there is a mismatch in the SimPFProducer. This PR simplifies the determination of the geometry type (using RecHitTools) in order to avoid relying on a RecHit collection that may be empty.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1529676631", "deletions": 7, "labels": ["bug-fix", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 23660, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "bug fix for case with SimClusters but no RecHits", "updated_at": "1529723077", "user": "kpedro88"}

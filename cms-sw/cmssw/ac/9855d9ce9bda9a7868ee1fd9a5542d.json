This update intends to improve performance by re-using the data structure and re-filling it for each of the regions. For this, some code is rearranged, but the algorithm itself is not changed at all. \r\n\r\nSome details and performance tests can be found here: https://cernbox.cern.ch/index.php/s/UWvE7a7itx6VGBs\r\n\r\nThe executive summary is:\r\n- Checked physics results both offline and online -> 100% identical \r\n- Checked timing of modules: Modules using regional tracking speed up between 3 and 40%. The gain strongly depends on the size of the regions, for many small regions the reduction in overhead naturally matters more than for few large ones. \r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "changed_files": 0, "closed_at": "1487057449", "comments": 23, "commits": 0, "created_at": "1485960291", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "ad5e08f0aa4f519289e45e4a26dced2388caefbe", "merged_at": "1487057449", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "number": 17373, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "Improve performance of Cellular Automaton for regional tracking at HLT", "updated_at": "1487057449", "user": "JanFSchulte"}

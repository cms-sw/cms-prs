This ensures that cand.dz(point) is always the same as cand.track.dz(point) whenever the track is available (as it was already the case for dxy)\r\n* fix the PhotonIDValueMapProducer on miniAOD to get the dxy and dz from the candidate instead of the track (dxy and dy are always available in the candidate, but they're not available in the track at low pT, and in 94X this causes an exception)\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1505917962", "comments": 13, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1505283600", "deletions": 30, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "84ca783be12883b016485ace946333f75a39c142", "merged_at": "1505917962", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_4_X", "number": 20491, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix PackedCandidate::dz and PhotonIDValueMapProducer", "updated_at": "1505917962", "user": "gpetruc"}

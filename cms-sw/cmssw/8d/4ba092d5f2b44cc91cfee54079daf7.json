The pseudorapidity calculation is rather heavy to repeat each time, so I have extended the class to cache that value as well. I also made a few minor improvements (avoid recalculating R^2 within a loop, avoid need for `dynamic_cast` to get user info).\r\n\r\nThe algorithm becomes about 25% faster when tested on the 2017 miniAODv2 GJets_HT-200To400_TuneCP5_13TeV-madgraphMLM-pythia8 sample.\r\n\r\nThe remaining use of CPU time is primarily from `fastjet::PseudoJet::squared_distance()`. This calculation may be repeated 2-4 times per candidate (nested loop, multiple algorithms invoked). However, I tried several schemes for caching it and did not get a speedup. It seems that the calculation is simple enough that it's better just to perform it each time.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": "1527792901", "comments": 25, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1526906485", "deletions": 70, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "orp-approved", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "8b2af0934b9ef5babc753c2824eb5ed05bc6bc96", "merged_at": "1527792901", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_2_X", "number": 23270, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 5, "state": "closed", "title": "Speedup puppi", "updated_at": "1527792901", "user": "kpedro88"}

Thus a risk exists that a configuration script using these without precaution can induce competing behaviours/steerings of the ESProducer/ESSource.\r\nFor now, as the PPS validation suite is orthogonal to the data reconstruction flow it is not affecting anything. Nevertheless this PR defines a function to automate the cloning of all critical objects prior to their use.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nPPS-related unit tests pass successfully. No effect expected on standard reconstruction chain.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR: N/A\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with any link to  -->\r\n\r\nBefore submitting your pull requests, make sure you followed this checklist:\r\n- [x] verify that the PR is really intended for the chosen branch\r\n- [x] verify that changes follow [CMS Naming, Coding, And Style Rules](http://cms-sw.github.io/cms_coding_rules.html)\r\n- [x] verify that the PR passes the basic test procedure suggested in the [CMSSW PR instructions](https://cms-sw.github.io/PRWorkflow.html)\r\n\r\n@fabferro @jan-kaspar @silviodonato ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1614221609", "comments": 11, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1614086579", "deletions": 15, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "b2a2af9f5a693b0a82f92ee620fc93828af8b3f6", "merged_at": "1614221609", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 32974, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "[PPS] Cloning of geometry definition objects prior to their usage/modification in validation tools", "updated_at": "1614221609", "user": "forthommel"}

The efficiency is defined wrt. TrackingParticles with `abs(pdgId) == 11`, and fake rate wrt. all TrackingParticles. On the same go, the definition of fake rate for conversions is also changed to be wrt. all TrackingParticles. In order to achieve these nicely, and to again properly support the separate `label_tp_effic` and `label_tp_fake` parameters of MultiTrackValidator, the following changes were made\n- The configuration of `TrackingParticleNumberOfLayersProducer` is fixed\n- MTV supports reading `TrackingParticleRefVector` instead of `TrackingParticleCollection`\n  - It would have been easier to just use `View<TrackingParticle>`, but `TrackToTrackingParticleAssociator` interface does not support it, and changing it would have had much larger impact. (I'll probably try to do it anyway some day)\n- `TrackingParticleConversionSelector` is changed to produce `TrackingParticleRefVector` (and renamed and turned to `edm::global`)\n- `TrackValidation_cff`is migrated to use `TrackingParticleRefVector` instead of copies\n- SimToReco (TP->track) association is created wrt. `label_tp_fake` TPs instead of `label_tp_eff`, and `label_tp_eff` is required to be a subset of `label_tp_fake` (explicit check is added)\n  - The SimToReco association is used in efficiency numerator, but also in duplicate rate numerator. For duplicates, the SimToReco must contain associations for TPs from `label_tp_fake`. For efficiency, these \"extra\" associations don't matter since the associations are checked only for `label_tp_eff`.\n\nTested in CMSSW_8_0_X_2016-02-15-1100 (with and without #13242), expecting changes under `Tracking/TrackConversion` (for fakes and other track-based histograms), and addition of `Tracking/TrackGsf` folder.\n\n@rovere @VinInn \nAutomatically ported from CMSSW_8_0_X #13324 (original by @makortel).\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 10, "closed_at": "1456913231", "comments": 17, "commits": 9, "created_at": "1455785995", "deletions": 128, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "627fba3751202dac936353d0fd2b7abf33bd4927", "merged_at": "1456913231", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 13348, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add GsfTracks to tracking validation", "updated_at": "1456997609", "user": "cmsbuild"}

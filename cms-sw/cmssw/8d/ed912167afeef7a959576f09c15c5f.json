It is supposed to be addition of the components in 3 directions. The multiplication of y and z components was corrected to `momentum.x() * diff.x() + momentum.y() * diff.y() + momentum.z() * diff.z()`.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nSee master PR\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

I also took the opportunity to protect the remaining E/gamma filters which were unprotected against this.  \n\nExplanation of the issue:\nDue to a rather poor design decision made before my time (yes its really that old), E/gamma trigger objects use TriggerClusters for non-saved RecoEcalCandidates and TriggerPhotons for saved RecoEcalCandidates. You need to look for both as there is no way to know for sure which the previous filter will output as it depends on whether saveTags=true for the previous filter. We probably should have fixed this at the source (and say this every time the issue comes up) but I'm concerned a core change in the framework will need a lot of testing for edge cases as it is not obvious everywhere this is used.  Just checking for both is an accepted solution that has been running fine for all of data taking. It is very clear when this bug comes in as the filter will accept zero events.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1398243684", "comments": 7, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1398164389", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "hlt-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "550d7148302d167e5c14c5dcce15b721555226d4", "merged_at": "1398243684", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_1_0_pre7", "number": 3423, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Trigger photon fix", "updated_at": "1415552846", "user": "Sam-Harper"}

The feature is needed to reconstruct, in parallel, DT segments out of digis from the phase-1 and -phase-2 DT readout chains of the DT slice-test demonstrator. Examples of results obtained after implementing this change are documented in [this talk](https://indico.cern.ch/event/942907/#31-slice-test-plots-for-approv).\r\n\r\nAt present, this feature is exploited only in private analysis workflows of DT slice-test data, therefore no changes are expected for standard workflows.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nBeyond the set of tests recommended [here](http://cms-sw.github.io/PRWorkflow):\r\n- performance results out of the analysis of DT slice-test data (linked above) were obtained based on this modification;\r\n- 100 events were produced out of the 1321.0 runTheMatrix.py workflow to test that the standalone muon reconstruction efficiency is unchanged.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 17, "closed_at": "1600882303", "comments": 44, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1598534236", "deletions": 14, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "hlt-approved", "l1-pending", "orp-approved", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "0d801f0c82b60087dfd406a0cd01d616268c78f1", "merged_at": "1600882303", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 31263, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 7, "state": "closed", "title": "Make DTTTrigSyncFromDB able to process multiple DTT0 instances", "updated_at": "1600882303", "user": "battibass"}

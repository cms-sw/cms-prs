This fixes another problem with the XGBoost photon producer. It was not scaling e2x2 variable by SC energy (s4). It should not impact the unit test.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nUnit test unchanged for x86_64 and should pass on all architectures now.\r\n\r\nUpdate: found to be caused by using `abs` which behaves differently on ARM and PPC.\r\nFix which changes to std::abs has been pushed.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 12, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1711360374", "deletions": 7, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 44531, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Unit test for XGBoost photon inference fix for non-x86_64 (14_1_X)", "updated_at": "1711552528", "user": "smorovic"}

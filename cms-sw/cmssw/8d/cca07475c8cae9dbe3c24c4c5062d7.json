This is very important for correct functioning of the clustering in high pileup.\n\nThis PR is meant to serve as a checkpoint of this work. \nThere are a few things to follow up before we commit this for central production.\n\n@pfs @vandreev11\n", "branch": "CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "changed_files": 26, "closed_at": "1421006260", "comments": 10, "commits": 32, "created_at": "1419018666", "deletions": 132, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "Next CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "number": 6993, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "HGC Clustering Checkpoint", "updated_at": "1421006260", "user": "lgray"}

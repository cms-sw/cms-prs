This sets\r\nthe critical distance parameter equal all over the Silicon detectors\r\nof HGCAL. The effect is visible in a much better separation of sibling\r\nshowers in the BH section.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nValidated on a privately produced sample of two `CloseBy` photons in `BH` separated by `3.5cm` to test merging vs separation.\r\n\r\n##### Before the fix\r\n![BH43_Evt15_wrong_deltac](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1169991/137873316-b97c3f3e-ae1c-4d08-9150-4b705ab0ae13.png)\r\n\r\n##### After the fix\r\n![BH43_Evt15_correct_deltac](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1169991/137873387-b2401242-a889-40de-a7cb-4ba3a152c441.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1634711091", "comments": 16, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1634625205", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "bug-fix", "orp-approved", "upgrade-approved", "code-checks-approved", "hgcal-dpg-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "5882c7246f613e50d00ed9f02ceff0924c782605", "merged_at": "1634711091", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "number": 35727, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Bug Fix for CLUE in BH section of HGCAL", "updated_at": "1634711091", "user": "rovere"}

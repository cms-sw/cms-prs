This sets\r\nthe critical distance parameter equal all over the Silicon detectors\r\nof HGCAL. The effect is visible in a much better separation of sibling\r\nshowers in the BH section.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nValidated on a privately produced sample of `CloseBy` photons in `BH` at `3.5cm` to test merging vs separation.\r\n\r\n![BH43_Evt15_wrong_deltac](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1169991/137873316-b97c3f3e-ae1c-4d08-9150-4b705ab0ae13.png)\r\n![BH43_Evt15_correct_deltac](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1169991/137873387-b2401242-a889-40de-a7cb-4ba3a152c441.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1634625205", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-approved", "hgcal-dpg-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "number": 35727, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Bug Fix for CLUE in BH section of HGCAL", "updated_at": "1634625645", "user": "rovere"}

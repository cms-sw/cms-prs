More details are discussed in this [github issue](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/44643#issuecomment-2041083105). While the CMSSW core team, HLT, and DQM are investigating the issues, we added a temporary fix using \"TryToContinue\" when a product is not found.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis PR was tested at p5 playback machines using the streamers containing the LSs of run 378981 in which this hlt client crashed.  Additionally this PR has been deployed in online production machine starting from run 379059. No more crashes were observed. But given that the root  cause was not yet resolved, one could see warning messages as \r\n```\r\n%MSG-e TrackRefitter:  TrackRefitter:hltTrackRefitterForSiStripMonitorTrack  07-Apr-2024 17:04:25 CEST Run: 379059 Event: 86050\r\ncould not get the reco::TrackCollection.hltMergedTracks\r\n%MSG\r\n%MSG-e SiStripMonitorTrack:  SiStripMonitorTrack:HLTSiStripMonitorTrack  07-Apr-2024 17:04:25 CEST Run: 379059 Event: 86050\r\nClusterCollection is not valid!!\r\n```\r\n\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 5, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1712555742", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "number": 44652, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[14_0_X] DQM: temporary fix of the crash of hlt DQM client using TryToContinue", "updated_at": "1713259843", "user": "syuvivida"}

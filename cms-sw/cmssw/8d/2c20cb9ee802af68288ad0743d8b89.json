Once that these new files will be available in _cms-data_, we will proceed with the coherent update of these files. The update is targeting **CMSSW_12_3_0**.\r\nThe current version of the updated L1 Menu is [L1Menu_Collisions2022_v1_0_0](https://github.com/cms-l1-dpg/L1MenuRun3/tree/master/development/L1Menu_Collisions2022_v1_0_0).\r\n(Previous reference PR https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/37138)\r\n\r\nIn the context of the trigger studies for the preparation of the Run 3 menu (L1+HLT), we recently faced an issue related to the emulation of the L1 prescales. Two different issues were found out:\r\n- format of the PS table (some documentation and a recipe can be found [here](https://github.com/cms-l1-dpg/L1MenuRun3/tree/master/development/L1Menu_Collisions2022_v1_0_0/PrescaleTable));\r\n- usage of the fractional PS ([PR#37046](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/37046)).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nBasic tests performed successfully starting from CMSSW_12_4_X_2022-04-03-2300.\r\nFrom CMSSW_12_4_X_2022-04-03-2300/src:\r\n> scram b distclean \r\n> git cms-checkdeps -a -A\r\n> scram b -j 8\r\n> scram b runtests\r\n> scram build code-checks\r\n> scram build code-format", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1649067978", "deletions": 10, "labels": ["l1-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 37453, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "New set of files coherent with the new v1_0_0 L1Menu", "updated_at": "1649232042", "user": "elfontan"}

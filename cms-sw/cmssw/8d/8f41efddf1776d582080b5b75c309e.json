And this should not be necessary for dropped branches\r\nand wastes a little CPU, so that is fixed also.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1490161867", "comments": 10, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1490124660", "deletions": 14, "labels": ["comparison-available", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "c3b387a9b6ec3858f23e02b79f45232eb507238b", "merged_at": "1490161867", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_1_X", "number": 18022, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix problem introduced by recent PR #17950 related to dropOnInput", "updated_at": "1501678789", "user": "wddgit"}

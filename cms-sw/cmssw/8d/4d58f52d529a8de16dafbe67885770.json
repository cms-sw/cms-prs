As this is a floating point calculation, it is likely already deprecated for the bitwise correct version...\n\nI also added back some range checks that were missing after the merge of latest global.  Perhaps these have no effect, but they were present during my tests, so I am leaving in place for now.  They should be scrutinized as well.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1461909020", "comments": 5, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1461907014", "deletions": 9, "labels": ["comparison-available", "l1-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "7b9cd491429f7979a53289ef08c59a1e86c91746", "merged_at": "1461909020", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 14296, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Bugfix Check L1T Global Scale Range", "updated_at": "1461916433", "user": "mulhearn"}

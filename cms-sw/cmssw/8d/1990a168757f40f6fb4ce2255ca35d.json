Since the Python version for CMSSW has been updated, this functionality was broken. This PR updates CondDBFW to Python3 and restores the uploadConditions_v2.py script functionality.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nMultiple uploads have been run with this new CondDBFW to the PREP database and they have all been successful. This Python 3 code is already in use in the server side.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 10, "comments": 0, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1631621043", "deletions": 763, "labels": ["db-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "number": 35268, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Update CondDBFW to Python3", "updated_at": "1631621089", "user": "Dres90"}

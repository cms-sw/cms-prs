Previously a parameterization of the simulated HL-LHC beam spot profile in z was used to weight entries, now just simple distributions, scaled by the total number of events to provide the per event density, are filled. The bin numbers have been significantly reduced, to improve the memory footprint of this code.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles, runs and provide the desired plots, showing that the expected beam spot sigma is about 4.29 cm and the corresponding time spread sigma is about 194 ps.\r\n\r\n![simpvz](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e71dfe49-b164-4708-9121-ea2bc4d0c113)\r\n![simpvt](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9337450-6bab-49c8-a642-8af7a36425f7)\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 2, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1729595395", "deletions": 44, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-rejected"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_2_X", "number": 46476, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "MTD validation: update vertex density plots", "updated_at": "1729595523", "user": "fabiocos"}

For each particle, the following features are used as input: pT, eta, phi, dxy, dxy_significance, and particle ID. The model produces a single anomaly score, which is used in the trigger decision.\r\n\r\nThe input tensor has shape [1, N_particles, 6], where N_particles is capped at 500 and particles are ordered by descending pT.\r\n\r\nPlease see test for example usage.\r\n\r\nDetails of the model architecture and training strategy were presented at the [TSG Meeting](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1606708/#preview:5650429)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trained model is stored in cms-data: https://github.com/cms-data/HLTrigger-HLTfilters/pulls\r\n\r\nHLT timing studies have been performed: https://cmshlttiming.app.cern.ch/display/maglowac/CMSSW_15_1_0.20260109_103717", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1769522153", "comments": 40, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1768834113", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["hlt-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved", "ml-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "32a1f97111e342ed8baca39d8ac7631ce2338cf3", "merged_at": "1769522153", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_16_1_X", "number": 49869, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 30, "state": "closed", "title": "Module to run second layer of Anomaly Detection with particle-level information in the High Level Trigger (HLT)", "updated_at": "1769522154", "user": "m-glowacki"}

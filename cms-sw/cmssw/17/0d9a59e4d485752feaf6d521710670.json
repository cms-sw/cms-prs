For each particle, the following features are used as input: pT, eta, phi, dxy, dxy_significance, and particle ID. The model produces a single anomaly score, which is used in the trigger decision.\r\n\r\nThe input tensor has shape [1, N_particles, 6], where N_particles is capped at 500 and particles are ordered by descending pT.\r\n\r\nPlease see test for example usage.\r\n\r\nDetails of the model architecture and training strategy were presented at the [TSG Meeting](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1606708/#preview:5650429)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trained model is stored in cms-data: https://github.com/cms-data/HLTrigger-HLTfilters/pulls\r\n\r\nHLT timing studies have been performed: https://cmshlttiming.app.cern.ch/display/maglowac/CMSSW_15_1_0.20260109_103717", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 32, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1768834113", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["hlt-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "ml-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_1_X", "number": 49869, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 29, "state": "open", "title": "Module to run second layer of Anomaly Detection with particle-level information in the High Level Trigger (HLT)", "updated_at": "1769430197", "user": "m-glowacki"}

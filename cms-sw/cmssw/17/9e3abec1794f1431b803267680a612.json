In the new case this can become negative if the total energy after calibration becomes smaller than the initial one. This was not seen in the past due to the high thresholds but it is visible now since with SiPMs the HO threshold can be ~ 100 MeV. Added protection.\nThis is a bugfix causing crashes in the Mini AOD sequence. And very strange for me it didnt cause  crashes in JME high level reco even if some candidates had LV = NaN ..\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1429042867", "comments": 10, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1428999584", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "b14e0f179083533b7fe60dd8f15a0effb6dc6de2", "merged_at": "1429042867", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 8724, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Added protection for negative HCAL energy in presence of HO causing NAN in PF", "updated_at": "1429045303", "user": "bachtis"}

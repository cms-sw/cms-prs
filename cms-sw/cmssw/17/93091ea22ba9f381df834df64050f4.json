This PR should conclude the changes in PPS DQM due to the new RP layout (most importantly the new timing RPs).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nBelow a screenshot of a DMQ file produced from 2018 data. In particular:\r\n  * in the left column: RP 220-near-hr is present in the list and has the timing set of plots, conversely the 210-near-hr is missing\r\n  * in the right part: the correlation histogram has the 220-near-hr on both axes.\r\n\r\n![dqm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17830858/135442559-40b97875-a378-4c5a-b79d-0628b407a264.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1633086700", "comments": 7, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1632991683", "deletions": 68, "labels": ["dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "a686932f1b9c01341d8936a04bb95ca540308772", "merged_at": "1633086700", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "number": 35484, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "PPS: RP id update in DQM common", "updated_at": "1633086701", "user": "jan-kaspar"}

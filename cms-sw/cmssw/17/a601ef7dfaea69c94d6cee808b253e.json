The GlobalCache pointer argument is no longer\r\nrequired (or allowed). Previously, it would just always\r\nbe set to nullptr.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis includes additions to an existing Framework unit test to cover this improvement. Note that outside of Framework unit tests there is nothing that uses this code yet so nothing in the RelVals should be affected.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1594994822", "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1594920221", "deletions": 20, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "4bd85a7a9e3a30e71f2ed2f88380c6293f1b5a85", "merged_at": "1594994821", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 30763, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Stream case with ProcessBlock and no GlobalCache", "updated_at": "1594994822", "user": "wddgit"}

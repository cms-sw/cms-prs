This means that, in sequences where `HBHEIsolatedNoiseReflagger` is not run, the `hbheplan1` module needs to be renamed to `hbhereco`. Therefore, where the `HBHEPhase1Reconstructor` would normally be named `hbhereco` in these sequences, it needs to be `hbheprereco` instead.\r\n\r\nThis change is made for NZS and Cosmic sequences. It should hopefully fix the crash at the Tier0. This PR will be backported to 90X and 84X (once the fix is agreed to work).\r\n\r\n@bsunanda: at some later date we need to make AlCa sequences aware of Phase1 changes:\r\nhttps://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/Calibration/HcalAlCaRecoProducers/python/ALCARECOHcalCalMinBias_cff.py\r\nhttps://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/Calibration/HcalAlCaRecoProducers/python/ALCARECOHcalCalPedestal_cff.py\r\n(I just noticed today that these exist.)\r\n\r\nattn: @deguio, @hatakeyamak, @abdoulline\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1488568833", "comments": 16, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1488464709", "deletions": 10, "labels": ["comparison-available", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "b99b620dc2bf798caf7381d8710b01bd5c5f326a", "merged_at": "1488568833", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_1_X", "number": 17751, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "fix sequences for HE plan1", "updated_at": "1488568833", "user": "kpedro88"}

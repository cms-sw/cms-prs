The parameter default is set to `False` so this PR should have no effect. The main motivation for the change is to be able to test mkFit within a customized HLT menu (as of today mkFit needs 4-hit seeds).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nLimited matrix runs.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1574844363", "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1574730324", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "51a261066ccca672e27651083b23532aaf7fdf03", "merged_at": "1574844363", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 28473, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Make it possible to use the fourth hit of a pixel track in SeedGeneratorFromProtoTracksEDProducer", "updated_at": "1574844363", "user": "makortel"}

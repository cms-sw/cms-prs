The BeamSpot should be taken from GlobalTag, especially after it gets/got updated from Gaussian to \"run2 realistic\" (in PRs #13516 (80X)/#13524 (81X)). This override caused the failure of 800patch1 2017 RelVals (see https://hypernews.cern.ch/HyperNews/CMS/get/relval/4545/1.html). There the \"run2 realistic\" BeamSpot was used consistently in SIM and GlobalTag, but was overridden to Gaussian for reco here. The other fake condition overrides are also unnecessary and thus removed.\n\nTested in CMSSW_8_1_X_2016-03-03-1100, no changes expected in IBs without #13516/#13524 (in IBs **with** either PR, large changes in tracking are expected).\n\n@rovere @VinInn @boudoul \n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1457338358", "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1457102895", "deletions": 137, "labels": ["comparison-available", "geometry-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "81014c9f2c19aaf7ec302731e15f6cf72969c5c9", "merged_at": "1457338358", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 13601, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Remove 2017 fake conditions", "updated_at": "1476957168", "user": "makortel"}

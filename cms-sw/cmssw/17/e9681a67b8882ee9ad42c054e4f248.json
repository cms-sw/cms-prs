Original description\r\n\r\n> Testing ROOT PR on an option to disable header parsing during `TClass::GetClass()` call (https://github.com/root-project/root/pull/18402) it was noticed the type alias gets listed in the `rootmap` file only if the alias is requested before the real type (see https://github.com/root-project/root/issues/19705 for more details).\r\n>\r\n> In the mean time, having the type alias in the `rootmap` file is necessary to avoid header parsing for the execution of the read rules that use the type alias names, e.g.\r\n> https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/2de49449715cd97f6de642a9b73a06318bd3f8b9/DataFormats/Portable/interface/PortableHostCollectionReadRules.h#L84\r\n> , and therefore it seemed worthwhile to change the dictionaries with ` PortableHost{Collection,Object}`.\r\n> \r\n> In the present state this PR demonstrates what the impact would be for the `PortableTestObjects`. If deemed viable, the next steps would be to update `DataFormats/Portable` README and `scripts`, and then update all the other `classes_def.xml` files that declare these portable data products.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nNone beyond https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/48824\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

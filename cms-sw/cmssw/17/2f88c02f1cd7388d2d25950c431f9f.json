Although this doesn't eliminate truncation, it reduces it enough that most of the modules can be identified in the summary. The PR also adjusts the columns heading positions of the MessageLogger Summary to match the increased field widths.\r\n\r\nThis is a small code change, but will obviously affect many CMSSW jobs.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 21, "closed_at": "1729597372", "comments": 44, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1727967107", "deletions": 227, "labels": ["core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved", "tests-ib-failure"], "merge_commit_sha": "8340b52ad5b3272e98a300259ff0c67959520800", "merged_at": "1729597372", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_14_2_X", "number": 46241, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "Increase field width in MessageLogger Summary", "updated_at": "1729597373", "user": "tomalin"}

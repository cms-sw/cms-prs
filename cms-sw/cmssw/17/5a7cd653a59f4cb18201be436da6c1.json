This PR fixes the issue. These are the tags from which the DQM GUI reads the list of known problematic towers in ECAL and displays them as dark red/dark yellow vs red/yellow.\r\nAdditionally the `toGet` method of accessing the DB tags is removed from the Ecal DQM config, on the suggestion of AlcaDB.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nPR is validated by running a local test which successfully creates an sqlite file which is uploaded to the DB and verified with an online DQM run on a test DQM GUI. Everything looks as expected.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\nN/A", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 42, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1655119370", "deletions": 12, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "alca-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-rejected", "orp-pending", "bug-fix", "code-checks-approved", "ecal"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 38357, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Code Fix to read tower geometry correctly in Ecal DQM StatusManager [Master]", "updated_at": "1655812304", "user": "abhih1"}

This PR fixes the issue. These are the tags from which the DQM GUI reads the list of known problematic towers in ECAL and displays them as dark red/dark yellow vs red/yellow.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nPR is validated by running a local test which successfully creates an sqlite file which is uploaded to the DB and verified with an online DQM run on a test DQM GUI. Everything looks as expected.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\nN/A", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 25, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1655119370", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "bug-fix", "code-checks-approved", "ecal"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 38357, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Changes to update the offline DB tags EcalDQMTowerStatus_v1_hlt and EcalDQMChannelStatus_v1_hlt [Master]", "updated_at": "1655651216", "user": "abhih1"}

This problem will be fixed separately there.\nMany DataFormats packages containing classes inheriting from DetId were missing declared link dependencies on DataFormats/DetID.\nIn ROOT 5.34, and ROOT 6, checksums depend on the base class.\nBecause of the missing link dependency, the other packages were built before DataFormats/DetId.\nBecause of this, edmCheckClassVersion calculated the wrong checksum.  The problem with edmClassVersion needs to be fixed separately, because the checksum it calculates can depend on build order of the packages.\nThis pull request supplies the missing dependencies, and updates the checksums accordingly, using scram b updateclassversion.\nPlease expedite this critical pull request, bypassing signatures if not signed in a timely manner.\nHowever, do not bypass testing, comparisons, and all that!!\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 14, "closed_at": "1419325645", "comments": 9, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1418999367", "deletions": 31, "labels": ["comparison-available", "l1-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "533757fc985fad09f5e109b8616c979a7c30c9bf", "merged_at": "1419325645", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 6984, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "Add missing build dependencies and update checksums", "updated_at": "1419348230", "user": "wmtan"}

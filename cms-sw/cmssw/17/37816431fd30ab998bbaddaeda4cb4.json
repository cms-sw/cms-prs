However, while preparing such a customization, I was able to recover a few HLT paths that were so far removed from the FastSim HLT menu [1]. Since the recover of those new paths comes for free, I have included it in the pull request. However, if this is not wanted, or if it can become the reason to delay the merging of this pull request, please @lveldere answer here as suche and I will revert it by keeping in this PR only the definitions of the additional modules needed for the developing HLT run2 menu in FastSim.\n\n[1]\n-    \"HLT_DoubleMediumIsoPFTau30_Trk1_eta2p1_Reg_Jet30_v*\", \n  -    \"HLT_DoubleMediumIsoPFTau30_Trk1_eta2p1_Reg_v*\",\n  -    \"HLT_DoubleMediumIsoPFTau35_Trk1_eta2p1_Prong1_Reg_v*\",\n  -    \"HLT_DoubleMediumIsoPFTau35_Trk1_eta2p1_Reg_v*\",\n  -    \"HLT_IsoMu18_eta2p1_MediumIsoPFTau25_Trk1_eta2p1_Reg_v*\",\n  -    \"HLT_DoubleMediumIsoPFTau45_Trk1_eta2p1_Reg_Jet30_v*\",\n  -    \"HLT_DoubleMediumIsoPFTau50_Trk1_eta2p1_Prong1_Reg_v*\",\n  -    \"HLT_IsoMu26_eta2p1_MediumIsoPFTau30_Trk1_eta2p1_Reg_v*\",\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1400048085", "comments": 7, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1399990371", "deletions": 22, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "fastsim-approved", "fully-signed", "hlt-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "bb20a79b86fbdbdddc7c65eb78131e0d0b94d648", "merged_at": "1400048085", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_1_0_pre8", "number": 3841, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "FastSim customizations for hlt run2", "updated_at": "1400051987", "user": "perrotta"}

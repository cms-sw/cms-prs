This involved adding the plugin FastTrackDeDxProducer.cc and modifying FastTrackerRecHits.[.h, .cc], as well as adding a data member to the class DataFormats/TrackerRecHit2D/interface/FastTrackerRecHit.h called energyLoss.\r\n\r\nThis PR was backported earlier, but closed afterwards as it was not urgently needed for production.  Now it is needed for a large SUSY signal production.  PPD has also been notified.\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_9_4_X", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1570513079", "comments": 11, "commits": 11, "created_at": "1569525932", "deletions": 7, "labels": ["backport-ok", "comparison-available", "fastsim-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "488f54f9fcb348c034c07a4849bf66e710e4e222", "merged_at": "1570513079", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_4_X", "number": 28076, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fastsim tracking add dedx collection - backport to 94X", "updated_at": "1570513079", "user": "ssekmen"}

It had been used during Run 1 to select events for the E/p calibration. Since Run 2 this is done with ECALELF instead. The class is not used anymore in CMSSW and neither in ECALELF code. Therefore, in coordination with ECAL calibration experts, we decided to remove it.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nPasses limited matrix workflows.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 0, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1632469336", "deletions": 223, "labels": ["alca-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "number": 35396, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "ECAL remove unused SingleEleCalibSelector class", "updated_at": "1632469370", "user": "thomreis"}

The job was failing (i.e. test succeeding), but for wrong reason: the configuration did not exist. This PR adds a configuration that tests the functionality properly, i.e. that an exception is thrown if `esConsumes()` is called outside of the EDModule constructor. Thanks to @Dr15Jones for finding this out. The test is also improved to fail if the job fails in a different way.\r\n\r\nThe second commit removes some `noexcept` specifiers to allow the exception from `esConsumes()` to propagate through `EDConsumerBaseAdaptor` classes.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nFramework unit tests run.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 7, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1639621122", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_3_X", "number": 36513, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Fix EventSetupIncorrectConsumes test", "updated_at": "1639661755", "user": "makortel"}

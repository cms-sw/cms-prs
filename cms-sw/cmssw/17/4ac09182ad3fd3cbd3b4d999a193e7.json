My script did not catch these before.\r\n\r\nAs always, only the dependencies which are **not included in any of the plugin sources** are removed, so these changes are orthogonal and complementary to the recent PRs which added all packages that are actually included in the **libraries**.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCMSSW compiles. It was checked that all newly added dependencies are actually required by the package with `git grep`.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 53, "closed_at": "1594701457", "comments": 44, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1593804484", "deletions": 255, "labels": ["alca-approved", "analysis-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "hlt-approved", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "d78dccdf7a7a8b7ca7d245e02c1d6c195978ddb6", "merged_at": "1594701457", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 30535, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 6, "state": "closed", "title": "Clean BuildFiles in reco plugins", "updated_at": "1594701458", "user": "guitargeek"}

In practice, we are getting some, see https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/39445#issuecomment-1252582561 for details.  This PR adds SIGFPE to the list of signals handled by InitRootHandlers, which should reduce the confusion caused by the ROOT signal handler being invoked, and may help diagnose where floating point exceptions are being enabled.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nIt compiles and unit tests succeed.  We do not have a unit test for InitRootHandlers, will add this to the todo list.  Purely technical change, should not have any performance or physics impact.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1663825715", "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1663775797", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "e9bfd7c0e08c8aa9ecc50c2ecebfe8b3745db7cf", "merged_at": "1663825715", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_6_X", "number": 39474, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "add SIGFPE to the list of signals handled by InitRootHandlers", "updated_at": "1663825715", "user": "dan131riley"}

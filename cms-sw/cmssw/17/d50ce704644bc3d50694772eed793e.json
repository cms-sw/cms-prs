It also generalizes the `FastCircleFit` and `RZLine` interfaces to work with e.g. `std::array`. On the same go `RZLine`\n- no longer uses `std::vector`, which reduces the number of memory allocations from `SeedGeneratorFromRegionHitsEDProducer` by ~11 % (phase1 ttbar+35PU; for the full job with tracking-only RECO,DQM,VALIDATION the reduction is ~1 %); no noticeable effect on CPU time though (with igprof)\n- allows to pass the square of `errZ`, to avoid `sqr(sqrt(X))` in `PixelQuadrupletGenerator` and `CAHitQuadrupletGenerator`\n\nTested in 8_1_0_pre8 and CMSSW_8_1_X_2016-07-19-2300. Tiny changes are expected in 2017 workflows from moving from `double` to `float` in `FastCircleFit` and removing `sqr(sqrt(X))`. No changes are expected in 2016 or phase2 workflows.\n\nHere is a set of MTV plots for phase1 (1000 ttbar+35PU events; with an intermediate point after `double`->`float` in `FastCircleFit`)\nhttps://mkortela.web.cern.ch/mkortela/tracking/validation/CMSSW_8_1_0_pre8_fcf_rzline/\n\n@rovere @VinInn @felicepantaleo \n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 17, "closed_at": "1469774387", "comments": 12, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1469184667", "deletions": 300, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "f43e8f6fe018848a835e8895e7f53136ee2b6e3b", "merged_at": "1469774387", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 15260, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 7, "state": "closed", "title": "Switch FastCircleFit to use Eigen, generalize FastCircleFit and RZLine interfaces", "updated_at": "1469804981", "user": "makortel"}

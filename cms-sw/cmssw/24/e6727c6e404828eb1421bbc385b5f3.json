I am doing a physics analysis in PbPb of studying the DDbar delta_phi correlation. For my analysis I need an official MC of only events containing at least 2 D0->k,pi decays\r\n\r\n- In the PR I added a specific filter that only permits events with at least 2 decays of D0->k,pi\r\n- PhysicsTools/GenFilters/plugins/GenD0PairToKPiFilter.cc\r\n- It does not depend on other PR or externals\r\n- As far as I could tell the existing CMSSW filters are not compatible with requiring pairs\r\n- To be clear, this filter (and PR) will be used when I request the official MC\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI produced 3M+ events with this filter according to the GEN/SIM steps and wrote a python script that analyzes all the outputted events to ensure that all of them do, in fact, have at least 2 instances of D0->k,pi\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

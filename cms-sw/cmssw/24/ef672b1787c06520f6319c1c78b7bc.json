The weights configuration can be now read from files and not only computed from the pulse shapes.\r\n\r\nThe necessary OnlineDB, CondDB and trigger emulator changes for the double weights mechanism have been already included in previous PRs : #33220, #33349, #33748\r\n\r\n## PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe full chain of ECAL TP configuration has been tested during the extended MWGR in November. The BEAMV7 key has been created in the OnlineDB by the configuration script and tested in global run.\r\nA description of the double weight mechanism and related DB classes has been given at the Alca meeting and can be found here: https://indico.cern.ch/event/1020767/#16-new-ecal-tpg-db-classes-for", "branch": "CMSSW_12_2_X", "changed_files": 12, "comments": 9, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1642689718", "deletions": 328, "labels": ["alca-approved", "l1-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-rejected", "orp-pending", "db-approved", "backport-ok"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_2_X", "number": 36760, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Backport: ECAL TPG Parameter Builder changes for double weights", "updated_at": "1642768732", "user": "valsdav"}

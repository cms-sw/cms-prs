Simulation) @ HLT  sequence for the Phase-2 setup.\r\nThis relies on the current naming of the tracking collections for the phase-2 HLT:\r\n   * `generalTracks::HLT` (somewhat copied from offline)\r\n   * `offlinePrimaryVertices::HLT` (as above)\r\n   * `hltPhase2PixelTracks` (pixel tracks)\r\n   * `hltPhase2PixelVertices` (pixel vertices)\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRun successfully `runTheMatrix.py -l 24834.0 -t 4 -j 8 --ibeos` and checked that HLT tracking and vertexing validation plots are filled.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

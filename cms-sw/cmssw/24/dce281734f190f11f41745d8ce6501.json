It is ROOT6 only.\nIn ROOT6 macros are processed by cling, rather than CINT. Over 500 CMSSW macros do not compile in ROOT6. Since that is too many macros to be fixed centrally, it was decided by David Lange to centrally fix only those 45 macros with compilation errors that have been modified since the switch over to git, since those are the ones most likely to be used. Many of these 45 macros are in the DQM L2 category. This pull request fixes them.\nNote 1: While this PR fixes all the compilation errors in these macros, one macro, JetBenchmarkSpecific/plot.C still has link errors that I was not able to easily fix. Still, the fact that now compiles is an improvement.\nNote 2: The declaration of function TLegend() Validation/RecoParticleFlow/interface/Comparator.h needed to be fixed. The function returned a const reference, but was not declared const. This caused macros to fail. I fixed the declaration by marking the function const. Just in case a non-const function was needed somewhere, I added a correct non-const TLegend() function.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 21, "closed_at": "1435777386", "comments": 6, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1429031007", "deletions": 262, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "dqm-approved", "generators-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 8741, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Macros need to compile in ROOT6 (DQM) (7_4_X)", "updated_at": "1435777390", "user": "wmtan"}

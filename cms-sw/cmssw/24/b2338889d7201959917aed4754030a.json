Neither of them is currently used by anything else, so this PR proposes to remove them as obsolete.\r\n\r\nThe removal of `RecoPixelVertexing/PixelTrackFitting/test/test_cfg.py` is not related to `PixelTripletLowPtGenerator`, but something additional I encountered that looked obsolete (and hence maybe not worth to be migrated). I included it here since it was also under `RecoPixelVertexing`.\r\n\r\nTested in CMSSW_9_0_X_2016-12-02-1100, no changes expected.\r\n\r\n@rovere @VinInn ", "branch": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1485525984", "comments": 19, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1481034745", "deletions": 430, "labels": ["comparison-available", "hold", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "number": 16886, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Remove PixelTripletLowPtGenerator as obsolete", "updated_at": "1485525984", "user": "makortel"}

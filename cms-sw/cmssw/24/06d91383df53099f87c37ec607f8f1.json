In this moment, some changes are expected for phase2 reco, but the real analysis should be done after the second PR, @VinInn can also comment in case of performance changes.\nNo changes are expected for other phases. \n\n@rovere @kpedro88 @boudoul \n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1474633527", "comments": 19, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1474443522", "deletions": 1539, "labels": ["comparison-available", "geometry-pending", "hold", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 15927, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Updating xmls Material Budget for Phase2 reco", "updated_at": "1474633528", "user": "ebrondol"}

This work is in preparation to start ME0Trigger studies on real digis.\r\n\r\nAttached is the output of the geometry tester showing in detail the layout of the system.\r\n[ME0testOutput.txt](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/files/1658158/ME0testOutput.txt)\r\n\r\n@jshlee @archiesharma @mmaggi ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 17, "comments": 7, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1516753038", "deletions": 986, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "geometry-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "upgrade-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_0_X", "number": 21936, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": " Post Muon TDR ME0 geometry cleanup", "updated_at": "1516762920", "user": "dildick"}

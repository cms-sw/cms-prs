This work is in preparation to start ME0Trigger studies on real digis.\r\n\r\nAttached is the output of the geometry tester showing in detail the layout of the system.\r\n[ME0testOutput.txt](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/files/1658158/ME0testOutput.txt)\r\n\r\n@jshlee @archiesharma @mmaggi ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 15, "closed_at": "1518365861", "comments": 28, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1516753038", "deletions": 969, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "3a5c0edf064979021837365fd435478c12821765", "merged_at": "1518365861", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_1_X", "number": 21936, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": " Post Muon TDR ME0 geometry cleanup", "updated_at": "1518365862", "user": "dildick"}

The main changes are in the configuration of MixingModule to make sure InputSource(s) of both FullSim and FastSim SimHits/SimTrack/SimVertex  are specified and read independently. Similar changes are propagated into digitizers of individual subsystems and TrackingTruthAccumulator. \r\n\r\nWe want a high statistics validation of default FullSim (Full Sim PU with FullSim Signal) and default FastSim digitization.  Once that is done and the results are found to be consistent with the release,  the validation should be done for the hybrid case with high statistics. For the hybrid case a subtle change in the MixingModule will be required, the **_skipSignal_**  parameter should be set to  **_True_**. This is a temporary fix and a better solution will be needed in future.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nValidation of Strip/Pixel and Ecal/Hcal digis were done using privately produced low statistics samples.\r\n\r\n#### References:\r\n- Motivation  [1](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1473390/contributions/6339653/attachments/3009322/5305390/Pileup%20Mixing%20Update%20feb%202025.pdf), [2](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1460070/contributions/6190298/attachments/2956387/5198603/Pileup%20Mixing%20Alternatives.pdf) \r\n- Description of code update  [3](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1525493/contributions/6418592/attachments/3032315/5353722/FastSimPUMixing_Status_14032025.pdf)\r\n- Validation results [4](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1541483/contributions/6487750/attachments/3056975/5404812/FastSimPUMixing_Status_25042025.pdf)\r\n\r\n@subirsarkar @bsunanda ", "branch": "CMSSW_15_1_FASTPU_X", "changed_files": 36, "comments": 39, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1746431684", "deletions": 259, "labels": ["operations-approved", "simulation-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "urgent", "upgrade-approved", "code-checks-approved", "tracking", "trk"], "number": 48009, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 31, "state": "open", "title": "Code updates to mix FastSim PileUp events with FullSim Signal events", "updated_at": "1747296422", "user": "suchandradutta"}

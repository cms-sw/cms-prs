It ignores genParticles that are not from collisionID = 0 (the signal event)\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested on wf 159 and 301\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nNo backport needed\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": "1637193695", "comments": 54, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1629969359", "deletions": 13, "labels": ["dqm-approved", "generators-approved", "operations-approved", "simulation-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "pdmv-approved", "orp-approved", "upgrade-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "b27d25be13387686c2b9c30aaa86ebab665724d5", "merged_at": "1637193694", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_2_X", "number": 35028, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Use pdigi_hi_nogen for HI MC wfs", "updated_at": "1637193695", "user": "mandrenguyen"}

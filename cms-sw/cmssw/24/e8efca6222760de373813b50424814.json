It ignores genParticles that are not from collisionID = 0 (the signal event)\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested on wf 159 and 301\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nNo backport needed\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 7, "comments": 33, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1629969359", "deletions": 13, "labels": ["simulation-pending", "dqm-pending", "generators-pending", "operations-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "hold", "pdmv-pending", "tests-started", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "number": 35028, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Use pdigi_hi_nogen for HI MC wfs", "updated_at": "1634069842", "user": "mandrenguyen"}

Among other things, one can now find in PhysicsTools/HeppyCore: \r\n\r\n- a test suite with fairly good coverage (~100 unit tests). \r\n- reference documentation: http://fcc-support-heppy.web.cern.ch/fcc-support-heppy/moduleIndex.html (still working on it)\r\n- papas : a generic particle flow simulation similar to Delphes\r\n- the particles package, which contains a set of particle-like classes that can be used transparently in different experiments\r\n- hooks to read the LCIO event data model (ILC, CLIC)\r\n\r\nBest, \r\n\r\nColin.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 238, "closed_at": "1510044031", "comments": 19, "commits": 138, "created_at": "1480071484", "deletions": 798, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 16758, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Heppy 8 0 24 patch1", "updated_at": "1510044031", "user": "cbernet"}

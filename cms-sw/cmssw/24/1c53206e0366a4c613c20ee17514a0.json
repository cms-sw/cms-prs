I expect to close this PR and resubmit later.\r\n\r\n@Dr15Jones @makortel I submitted this mostly for your comments. I am mostly interested in your comments to what I have done in IOPool/Output. The code I will be implementing in the next few weeks heavily depends on the changes to the file format in there. It would be much easier to change course now if I am headed in the wrong direction.\r\n\r\nI have not tested this yet, although it compiles and the Core unit tests pass. There are still probably some little bugs and errors in this code. Don't spend too much time looking for those detailed kinds of problems.\r\n\r\nI was curious to see if this set of changes breaks anything in the PR tests.\r\n\r\nThis PR is missing most of the IOPool/Input changes and the changes to introduce the cache, cache related indices and other things. I left those parts out because they are not done yet.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 49, "closed_at": "1605909953", "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1604604826", "deletions": 173, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "core-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-rejected"], "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 32042, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 13, "state": "closed", "title": "ProcessBlock persistence, do not merge", "updated_at": "1605909953", "user": "wddgit"}

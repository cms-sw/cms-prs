(customiseForPremixingInput.customiseForPreMixingInput). \nThis customisation is applied on top of the era customisation.\nThis has 2 negative impacts:\ni) some modification is applied twice (needles)\nii) the customisation functions may get out of sync with the era modifications and overwrite the era modifications in the wrong way\n\nThe latter is the cause of the long-lasting issue that the L1 emulator does not properly work with FastSim premixing. \n\nWith this pull request, the only modifications applied outside the eras are the very premixing specific ones.\n\nCAUTION: this pull request has some unexpected consequences on dumped configurations for simulation + premixing. Probably because the customisation functions are no longer maintained and got out of sync with the era modifications.\n\n@mdhildreth , you probably want to have a look at this one\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1453277645", "comments": 12, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1452607229", "deletions": 10, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 12919, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Let eras deal with all postLS1 customs common for mixing and premixing", "updated_at": "1453277645", "user": "lveldere"}

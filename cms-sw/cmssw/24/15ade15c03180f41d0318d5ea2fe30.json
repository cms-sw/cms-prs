If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nVerbatim backport of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/48957 to the 2025 PbPb data-taking release, for online tests.\r\n \r\nCc: @smorovic ", "branch": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1758791205", "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1758523007", "deletions": 41, "labels": ["hlt-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "backport-ok"], "merge_commit_sha": "a388a292f20709587bdae1ee36bbf7dee4797d43", "merged_at": "1758791205", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 48965, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "[15.1.X] add support for multiple input FEDs in `HLTL1NumberFilter`", "updated_at": "1758791207", "user": "mmusich"}

If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nVerbatim backport of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/48957 to the 2025 PbPb data-taking release, for online tests.\r\n \r\nCc: @smorovic ", "branch": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1758523007", "deletions": 41, "labels": ["hlt-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "backport-ok"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 48965, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[15.1.X] add support for multiple input FEDs in `HLTL1NumberFilter`", "updated_at": "1758523178", "user": "mmusich"}

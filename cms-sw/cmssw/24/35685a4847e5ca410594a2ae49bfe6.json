To process the reconstructed files (step3.root) for Muon Tomography studies.\r\n2. Checks added for detid validity. This has been found to spot the origin of the problem observed during DQM study.

Added feature to mark the first three cell indices(added by Pruthvi).\r\n\r\nTogether with PR #39774 this completes the full picture of Muon Tomography both at the generation and reconstruction level.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nrunTheMatrix test is not applicable since it produces a separate tomography related output file.\r\nPlease perform standard test like coding convention and related tests.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

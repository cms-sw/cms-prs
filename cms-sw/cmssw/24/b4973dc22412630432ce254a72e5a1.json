In addition, the cff and cfi file guidelines described in https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/SWGuideAboutPythonConfigFile are now followed more closely\n- updated MVA computer so it ignores any extra TaggingVariables in case they are provided by the jet tag computer\n- removed extra instance of the CSV computer now that the MVA computer has been updated\n\nSome validation plots are attached:\n\n**TCHE**\n![performance_tche](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4885289/4960600/c2b86e46-66c4-11e4-920d-26afaa137dbb.png)\n\n**CSV**\n![performance_csv](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4885289/4960604/cc3a72c0-66c4-11e4-9173-24fad70a2b24.png)\n\n**CSVv2+IVF**\n![performance_csvv2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4885289/4960607/d65048ca-66c4-11e4-9c55-59faaf51c91a.png)\n\nThe only plot showing small changes is the CSV one which is expected because of updated `maxDeltaRToJetAxis` vertex cut from `0.5` to `0.4`. CSVv2+IVF is not affected since there is an additional `extSVDeltaRToJet` cut set to `0.3` so the above  `maxDeltaRToJetAxis` change does not affect IVF vertices.\n\nThis PR supersedes #6261 \n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_3_X", "changed_files": 130, "closed_at": "1415648550", "comments": 14, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1415392256", "deletions": 696, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "4f323d99f0bfced9edabfae5f414f0a54d1e2cbd", "merged_at": "1415648550", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_3_X", "number": 6283, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "btag code cleanup ", "updated_at": "1419385844", "user": "ferencek"}

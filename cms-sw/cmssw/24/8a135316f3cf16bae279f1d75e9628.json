Now this is a pure reconstruction module;\r\n- update of the so far unused primary vertex constraint logic for track-hit matching. Up to now only the leading PV was considered, with a analysis-like selection of matching along z, now all PVs are used, checking the track-vertex link according to vertex reconstruction.\r\n\r\nThis second part is not used, and is not usable with the existing schedule, where the extender is an input for PV reconstruction. But it could be potentially used for a second run, or on top of the 3Dt PVs if the schedule is modified.\r\nAs the functionality is already present, it is simply adapted to a wider possible use, deferring its detailed validation though to the case this is really studied. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles and runs on basic RelVal wfs.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 4, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1749629607", "deletions": 59, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 48296, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "MTD reconstruction: TrackExtender code cleanup", "updated_at": "1749629818", "user": "fabiocos"}

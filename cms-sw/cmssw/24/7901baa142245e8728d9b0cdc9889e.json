In practice there may be few consequences, but this implements the fix to avoid any potential unwanted effects down the line.\r\n- Add support for 16-bit integers in NanoAOD and fix some inconsistencies for other types (uint, double) in the flat table producer\r\n- Use 8 and 16 bit integers instead of full-size ints where relevant (charges, indices, IDs, counters...). While compression did help in hiding the zeroed unused bits, I still noticed a few percent-level reduction in the size then using native types instead.\r\n    - Note that I avoided using `int8` for signed integers and always relied on `int16` instead. This is because ROOT interprets `int8` as a `char`, which messes up things like `TTree::Draw` and `TTree:Scan` (filling the histogram with characters instead of numbers). \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRan a nano matrix workflow.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 28, "comments": 16, "commits": 9, "created_at": "1673445305", "deletions": 170, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "xpog-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "number": 40478, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Nano: fix array size branch type, support 16 bit ints, use more 8 or 16 bit integers", "updated_at": "1673544252", "user": "swertz"}

In auch a case it does not make sense to separate them, so the PFBlockAlgo was merged with the producer\r\n* Moving already a lot of the code around, the whole new PFBlockProducer was formatted with Davids clang-format file shown in the last reco meeting (would be done anyway at some point)\r\n* Remove preprocessor directives\r\n* some spurious modernization of the code\r\n* put the QuickUnion class into its own files, as I think it's general enough to deserve that (also clang-formatted)\r\n\r\nObservations:\r\n* after making the links between elements a first time, the links are stored in a hash table before going after the elements a second time and updating the links. That is not really efficient. There is definitely room for speedup and improvement in this producer! Does it take a significant portion of the reconstruction time?\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCMSSW compiles and matrix tests pass.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "comments": 0, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1553636380", "deletions": 737, "labels": [], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 26265, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "RecoParticleFlow/PFProducer - PFBlockProducer and PFBlockAlgo merging", "updated_at": "1553636399", "user": "guitargeek"}

In general, the method can be used easily for any calorimeter, however, is used so far only for CASTOR.\n\nThere is a study to validate the code with particle gun simulations, which has been presented here:\n\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/406099/session/5/contribution/5/attachments/812726/1113869/fs_noncompensation_and_cmssw7_electron_response.pdf\n\nThis is needed for Run2 detector simulations for detector unfolding. We need the code in the respective CMSSW versions used for MC productions. This is most probably at least CMSSW_7_5_X , thus, we will need a back-port to this. \n\nThis pull request is identical to the ones #10195 (CMSSW_7_1_X) and  #10196 (CMSSW_7_4_X).\n\nBest regards,\nR.

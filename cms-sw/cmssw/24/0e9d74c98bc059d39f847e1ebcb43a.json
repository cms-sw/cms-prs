In more detail, the check complained that the cases of SwitchProducer `foo` did not declare products of SwitchProducer `bar`. This PR fixes the check by limiting the check to limit the products-to-be-checked to a single `SwitchProducer`.\r\n\r\nTested in 10_5_0_pre1.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1548864371", "deletions": 12, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_5_X", "number": 25801, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Fix SwitchProducer sanity checks to allow more than one SwitchProducer in a job.", "updated_at": "1548878352", "user": "makortel"}

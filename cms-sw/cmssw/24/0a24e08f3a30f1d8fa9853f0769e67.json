CSV>0.7).\nIt uses a jet InputTag only to fill the TriggerFilterObjectWithRefs.\n\nHLTJetTagWithMatching is a filter that loop on a jet collection, and each jet is matched with the jetTag.\nIn this way it use the jet information from the jet collection, and the b-tag information by the jetTag collection.\n\nWith the new module, it will be possible, for instance, to have filter like \"at least one jet with pT>50 GeV and CSV>0.7\". In fact, you can produces a subset of jets and give it as InputTag to this module.\n\nCheers,\nSilvio.\n\ncc: @aclebihan, @arizzi\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1419260641", "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1418999623", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "fully-signed", "hlt-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "a8ae814a7ae4859c6135bee8a54348203061392d", "merged_at": "1419260641", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 6985, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "HLTJetTagWithMatching", "updated_at": "1419261738", "user": "silviodonato"}

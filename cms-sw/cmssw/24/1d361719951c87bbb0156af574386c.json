This lead to a problem\nwhen the same EDProducer was on a Path and an EndPath. This would cause the\nEDProducer to be removed from the Path but left on the EndPath so the EDProducer\nwould remain scheduled. If modules on a Path needed the results from that\nEDProducer they would fail to get those products.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1460030544", "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1460030504", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "core-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 13978, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Clean EndPaths as well when going unscheduled", "updated_at": "1463138375", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

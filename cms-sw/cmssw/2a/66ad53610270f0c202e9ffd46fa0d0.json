One of two DNN architectures (classifier or regressor) can be used. The trained models and necessary data are provided externally; the latest models are added by this PR: \r\nhttps://github.com/cms-data/RecoMuon-TrackerSeedGenerator/pull/2.\r\n\r\nThe PR contains three new files.\r\n* The plugin code:\r\n\t`RecoMuon/TrackerSeedGenerator/plugins/TSGForOIDNN.cc`\r\n\t`RecoMuon/TrackerSeedGenerator/plugins/TSGForOIDNN.h`\r\n* Example of configuration:\r\n\t`RecoMuon/TrackerSeedGenerator/python/customizeOIseeding.py`\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe performance of the new methods has been presented at Muon POG meeting [[link](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1073323/contributions/4513876/attachments/2303367/3918362/Purdue_muonHLT_sep6.pdf)].\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 57, "commits": 29, "created_at": "1631366565", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-rejected", "orp-pending", "requires-external", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "number": 35237, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 78, "state": "open", "title": "DNN-based optimization of seeding in outside-in sequence of Muon HLT", "updated_at": "1633153190", "user": "kondratyevd"}

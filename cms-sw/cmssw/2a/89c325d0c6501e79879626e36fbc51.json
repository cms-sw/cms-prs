The first one is a fix by the L1T group to correctly apply fractional prescales in L1T software (needed, for example, for the development of the HIon menu); the 2nd PR is a technical follow-up of the 1st one, adding a unit test and small technical improvements.\r\n\r\nBecause of #39832, this PR requires the backport of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmsdist/pull/8140 to the `12_5_X` branch of `cmsdist`.\r\n\r\nOn top of the backports, there is one more commit (844f35a0edd): I had to change the input file of the unit test to use a `12_5_X` file.\r\n\r\nFYI: @elfontan @mitaylor\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe new unit test passes in local tests.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

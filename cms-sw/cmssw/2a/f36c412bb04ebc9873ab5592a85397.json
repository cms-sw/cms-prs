It only makes the definitions of the nested class/struct public.\nThis has been tested with checkdeps -a and the relval matrix.\n\nIn some cases, the declarations were moved to keep the public and private sections of the class each contiguous.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1382451165", "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1382444596", "deletions": 13, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "visualization-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "caea49154515029256dc77eb15220e581216c651", "merged_at": "1382451165", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_0_0_pre7", "number": 1132, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Root6 cannot create dictionary for nested private structs (yet again)", "updated_at": "1382455375", "user": "wmtan"}

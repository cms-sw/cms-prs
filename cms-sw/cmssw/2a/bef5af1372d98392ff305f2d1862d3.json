In a similar way, the offset with pixel detectors is used to properly display the tomography.\r\n- Updated tests to cope with PR 22264", "branch": "CMSSW_10_1_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1523375429", "comments": 8, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1523351220", "deletions": 117, "labels": ["backport-ok", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_1_X", "number": 22916, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "CTPPS: updated DQM for 2018 data taking; backport of #22447", "updated_at": "1523375430", "user": "nminafra"}

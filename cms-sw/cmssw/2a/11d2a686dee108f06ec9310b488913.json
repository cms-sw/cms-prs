It is caused by using a dangling reference to\nan edm::EventID object to determine the run number. At least with the gcc\nversions in SLC6, this results in an incorrect determination of the current\nIOV. Details are given in this presentation at the tracker-alignment meeting:\n\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/342234/session/0/contribution/8/0/material/slides/0.pdf\n\nThe implementation is the outcome of a discussion of #6515 .\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "changed_files": 12, "closed_at": "1427812033", "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1417456372", "deletions": 40, "labels": ["alca-approved", "comparison-pending", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "a2c11319d29e2eab80ee52f36cb789eb782ab426", "merged_at": "1427812033", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "number": 6728, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Important BUG FIX in parameter assignment of millepede-based tracker alignment", "updated_at": "1427812034", "user": "mschrode"}

Now the model index is directly passed from the DNNHelper evaluator to the caller code, ensuring the consistency in the number of outputs. (Following comment https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/38175#issuecomment-1144888684)\r\n\r\nMoreover the electron model selection is now performed correctly with SuperCluster.eta instead of Electron.eta.\r\n\r\n#### PR Validation: \r\nThe PR has been validated with local tests. \r\n\r\n#### Release notes:\r\nThis is urgently needed for the 12_4_0 release.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 9, "comments": 19, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1655116602", "deletions": 25, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "urgent", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 38356, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "open", "title": "[bugfix] Improved Egamma PFID model selection consistency", "updated_at": "1655212436", "user": "valsdav"}

Now the model index is directly passed from the DNNHelper evaluator to the caller code, ensuring the consistency in the number of outputs. \r\n\r\nMoreover the electron model selection is now performed correctly with SuperCluster.eta instead of Electron.eta.\r\n\r\n#### PR Validation: \r\nThe PR has been validated with local tests. \r\n\r\n#### Release notes:\r\nThis is urgently needed for the 12_4_0 release.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 9, "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1655116602", "deletions": 33, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 38356, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[bugfix] Improved Egamma PFID model selection consistency", "updated_at": "1655117050", "user": "valsdav"}

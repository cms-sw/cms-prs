The information it stores became redundant after the Run2 rewrite of the BlockProducer, only the `dist` member is actually used => the class can just be replaced with a `double`\r\n* __PFBlockAlgo__: adapt to the removal of the PFBlockLink class\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the includes in the PFBlockAlgo/PFBlockProducer were cleaned up. For this, I used the necessary includes found by the include-what-you-use (iwyu) tool [in my old PR](https://github.com/guitargeek/cmssw/blob/c5fe14b2e2453dbafd312dca1c11534ae86d21fc/RecoParticleFlow/PFProducer/plugins/PFBlockProducer.cc) and spread them across the 4 files as appropriate.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles and matrix tests complete.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 21, "closed_at": "1556219899", "comments": 24, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1556047480", "deletions": 601, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "01cf38ac0aa09dd3638465cb6a385b4e46a5a39d", "merged_at": "1556219899", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 26519, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "RecoParticleFlow/PFProducer - some cleanup and modernization", "updated_at": "1556219899", "user": "guitargeek"}

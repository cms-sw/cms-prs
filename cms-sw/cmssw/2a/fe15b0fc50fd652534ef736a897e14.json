The information it stores became redundant after the Run2 rewrite of the BlockProducer, only the `dist` member is actually used => the class can just be replaced with a `double`.\r\n* __PFBlockAlgo__: adapt to the removal of the PFBlockLink class.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles and matrix tests complete.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 21, "comments": 4, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1556047480", "deletions": 601, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 26519, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "RecoParticleFlow/PFProducer - some cleanup and modernization", "updated_at": "1556048245", "user": "guitargeek"}

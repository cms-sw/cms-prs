Similarly, `MuonShowers` are created from \"OR\"-ed combinations of `RegionalMuonShower` in a global muon trigger module. From the class definition `RegionalMuonShower` and `MuonShower` look like bulky objects, but in the trigger they only carry 4 bits of information per BX. Additional documentation in DN-20-033.\r\n\r\nDocumentation now also provided in [DN-15-017](https://gitlab.cern.ch/tdr/notes/DN-15-017/uploads/f08b31205b34ce754317d2cf6d12b25b/DN-15-017_temp.pdf)\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles. The new objects are not yet plugged in to the emulators.

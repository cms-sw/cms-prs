PR to the latter will follow this PR. Installation recipe for tests below,\r\n* Python tool providing updated pat::Tau collection and an example configuration.\r\n\r\nThe new Tau-Ids are not part of any current workflow and primary they are meant to be run within users' workflows. Their integration as a part of NanoAOD or/and MiniAOD will be a subject of separate pull requests when this one is accepted. \r\nBackports to 94X and 102X release series (used for 2016/17 and 2018 datasets) is foreseen when  this one is accepted.\r\n\r\nRecipe for tests (as new modules are not part of standard workflows):\r\n* Checkout needed training files:\r\n```\r\nmkdir -p $CMSSW_BASE/external/$SCRAM_ARCH/data\r\ncd $CMSSW_BASE/external/$SCRAM_ARCH/data\r\ngit clone https://github.com/cms-tau-pog/RecoTauTag-TrainingFiles -b master RecoTauTag/TrainingFiles/data\r\ncd -\r\n```\r\n* Edit and run tests configuration:\r\n```\r\ncmsRun RecoTauTag/RecoTau/test/runDeepTauIDsOnMiniAOD.py\r\n```\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 10, "comments": 49, "commits": 49, "created_at": "1540552401", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_4_X", "number": 25016, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 38, "state": "open", "title": "DNN-based Tau-Id discrimians", "updated_at": "1543581683", "user": "mbluj"}

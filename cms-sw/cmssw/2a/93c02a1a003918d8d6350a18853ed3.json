It was checked that all newly added dependencies are actually required by the package with `git grep`.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 12, "closed_at": "1600798005", "comments": 13, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1600728591", "deletions": 15, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "ce0a5cdbb90d0b4a64908d4be53cbf11246bc473", "merged_at": "1600798005", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 31532, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Clean BuildFiles in IO subsystems", "updated_at": "1600798006", "user": "guitargeek"}

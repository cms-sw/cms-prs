Plan to switch to the new mechanism in a future PR, once the DB is populated with the new payloads.\n\nRelevant Discussion:\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/328166/session/1/contribution/24\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_3_X", "changed_files": 76, "closed_at": "1414220248", "comments": 30, "commits": 12, "created_at": "1412955037", "deletions": 10401, "labels": ["alca-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "178b971d93154727b174268bd8426d45e356471d", "merged_at": "1414220248", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_3_X", "number": 5785, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 12, "state": "closed", "title": "Geometry and configuration of Magnetic Field from DB", "updated_at": "1414687533", "user": "namapane"}

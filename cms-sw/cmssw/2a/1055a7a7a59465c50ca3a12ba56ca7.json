It contains a cms.Sequence configured to produce GsfTracks. \r\n\r\nThis is done with improved performance in the region 0.5 < pT < ~10 GeV with respect to the nominal EGamma chain. \r\n\r\nExisting modules are cloned, a new EDProducer is provided, and new collections are made using existing DataFormats, to provide a fully standalone chain that does not touch the existing EGamma reconstruction. \r\n\r\nThe new LowPtGsfElectronSeedProducer relies on the output of two BDTs, which are provided via this pull request:\r\nhttps://github.com/cms-data/RecoEgamma-ElectronIdentification/pull/10\r\n\r\nAn additional pull request will be made on a short time scale that complete the electron reconstruction chain (adding SuperClusters, GsfElectronCores, GsfElectron, and ID). \r\n\r\nPotential further PRs may be made that define workflows for 1) a skim of the B parked data set, enriched in B->K(*)ll events, and 2) a data control sample of photon conversions to soft electrons. \r\n\r\n@mverzett , @Sam-Harper , @nancymarinelli , and @gkaratha are interested to follow this thread. \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nrob\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 17, "comments": 72, "commits": 15, "created_at": "1544219955", "deletions": 146, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "fastsim-pending", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_5_X", "number": 25455, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 44, "state": "open", "title": "Low pT electrons (up to GsfTracks) ", "updated_at": "1545314773", "user": "bainbrid"}

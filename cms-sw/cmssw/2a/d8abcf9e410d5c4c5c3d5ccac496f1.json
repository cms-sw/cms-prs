It was reported by Htogg people that they faced problems in using 80X regression in 94X (i.e. loading an object that reloads database info and reevaluates information). This was because the EGM regression changed in 9X. So EGMPOG now plans to maintain the previous versions of regression as well. Changes done:\r\n(1) Renamed : RecoEgamma/EgammaTools/plugins/EGExtraInfoModifierFromDB.cc  RecoEgamma/EgammaTools/plugins/EGRegressionModifierV2.cc\r\n(This contains the latest version of corrections)\r\n\r\n(2) Make a new class RecoEgamma/EgammaTools/plugins/EGRegressionModifierV1.cc  This is essentially the class which has 80X regression.\r\n\r\n(3) RecoEgamma/EgammaTools/python/regressionModifier_cfi.py  This now contains a cms.PSet named regressionModifier80X which contains all the parameters set for 80X regression.\r\n\r\nThis setup has been tested on 80X root file in 94X and the reloading of database info and re-evaluating information is running fine now.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nShilpi", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 5, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1519988015", "deletions": 15, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-started"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_1_X", "number": 22417, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Port 80X EGM regression in 10X", "updated_at": "1519988307", "user": "jainshilpi"}

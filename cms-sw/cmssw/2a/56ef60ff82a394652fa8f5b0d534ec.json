This was traced to a missing \"continue\" statement when checking for a null geometry which was an oversight on my part last year. This PR adds that continue statement and is a simple and necessary bug fix.\r\n\r\nAfter discussing with Federico, he informed me that its QEI11 digi not having a valid geometry does happen because laser calibrations etc get mixed into the digi collection. It is harmless to pass them through as they will be killed later on by the hcal reco code. As I hate errors being sent when it is not an error, I adapted the error message not to fire if its a HCAL type which is known not to have a geometry which accounts for the other 26 lines of changes. \r\n\r\nWe request that this simple bug fix be in the next 10_0_X release as it is necessary to control HLT timing with a fully upgraded HE detector. Expect to see a PR for the backport shortly.

Additionally, it fixes the Exception printout message in case \"No XML converter is found...\"\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nCode compiles plus a few local tests using the `discover` function that is updated here.\r\n\r\n#### Backport:\r\nNot a backport, but to be backported all the way back to 13_0_X.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1690384444", "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1690289219", "deletions": 27, "labels": ["fully-signed", "tests-approved", "db-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "626dd622295229b5c5c504b66bab0859fb31b172", "merged_at": "1690384444", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_13_3_X", "number": 42357, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Improve discover method in cond2xml for read-only and patch releases", "updated_at": "1690384444", "user": "francescobrivio"}

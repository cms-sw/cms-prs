These proxies are components that implement the `Storage` API and hold a another `Storage` object. The proxies are implemented as validated plugins, and they are configured bia the `TFileAdaptor` (i.e. `AdaptorConfig` Service).\r\n\r\nThis PR implements two such proxy components\r\n* `StorageTracerProxy` for tracing the operations, including a script to do some analysis on the trace\r\n* `StorageAddLatencyProxy` for adding artificial latency to the operations\r\n\r\nResolves https://github.com/cms-sw/framework-team/issues/1361\r\nResolves https://github.com/cms-sw/framework-team/issues/1391\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe tracer and latency addition code were extensively used when studying https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/47750", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 25, "comments": 14, "commits": 9, "created_at": "1747161095", "deletions": 66, "labels": ["core-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 48073, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "open", "title": "Add storage tracer", "updated_at": "1747241403", "user": "makortel"}

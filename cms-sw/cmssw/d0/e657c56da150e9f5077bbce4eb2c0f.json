AOD will not contain several collections (ecal rechits, hcal rechits) that we were previously using at analysis level to compute photon isolation variables. This information is absolutely essential for all Heavy Ion photon analyses, past and present.\n\nIn this branch I've proposed a straw-man solution, which is to make a new dataformat which inherits from reco::photon and includes new datamembers for Heavy Ion use. The isolation and some spike information is saved in the new dataformat and kept in AOD.\n\nI realize that adding new dataformats is not trivial, so I'm expecting this PR to get shot down, but any advice on a better method would be much appreciated. \n\n@lgray @yetkinyilmaz \n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "changed_files": 13, "closed_at": "1432180377", "comments": 47, "commits": 21, "created_at": "1431437858", "deletions": 20, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "20bae6b0ba97712ee5406b841def42b177375e7e", "merged_at": "1432180377", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_5_X", "number": 9057, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 61, "state": "closed", "title": "New dataformat/producer for Heavy Ion AOD photons", "updated_at": "1432180377", "user": "richard-cms"}

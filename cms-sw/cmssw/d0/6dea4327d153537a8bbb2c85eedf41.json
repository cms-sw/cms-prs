Since 2022, there are two categories of such events:\r\n- events flagged as such because of trigger rules (for example: if a L1Accept happens in BX-3, BX-2/BX-1 are masked, making BX0 unprefirable).  This is the original category, existing since Run 2. \r\n- first bx in trains were made explicitly unprefirable by masking the previous bx, for part of 2022 and 2023 data. \r\n\r\nThis PR adds the second category and split the existing boolean in NANOAOD (`L1_UnprefireableEvent`) in two. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe PR succesfully passed the following test\r\n`runTheMatrix.py -l 2500.4,141.044`\r\n\r\nNote that when reemulating L1, only BX0 is reemulated, and the `L1_UnprefireableEvent_FirstBxInTrain` decision can't be evaluated. \r\nIt was explicitly checked in wf 141.044 that the decision is correct when L1 is not reemulated. \r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nNot a backport. Backports foreseen for all future releases foreseen for reNANO of Run 3 data. (Can you please advise?)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1698663588", "deletions": 14, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "xpog-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_3_X", "number": 43150, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Adding L1 unprefirable bit for 1st bx in train", "updated_at": "1699272723", "user": "lathomas"}

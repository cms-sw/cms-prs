After some checks, it was found that this change in threshold does not have a significant impact in the efficiency of PF electrons while it does degrade the jet resolution by roughly 6%.\r\n\r\n@mandrenguyen @pfs @RSalvatico\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested with workflows 162,162.02,162.03,162.1,162.2,162.3,162.4\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

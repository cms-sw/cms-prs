This change caused failures of EcalLaser_prompt_run3 O2O jobs. This is a workaround changing the URL to  'https://cmsweb-prod.cern.ch/t0wmadatasvc/prod/' which is running the pre-migration version not requiring the certificate. It is only a temporary solution as the pre-migration version is going to be decommissioned after 7 days from the migration which took place on 20.08.2024\r\n\r\nThe EcalLaser_prompt_run3 are using the URL \"CondCore/Utilities/python/tier0.py\". We didn't notice the impact of the other occurrences of this URL changed in this PR.\r\n\r\nThis is not meant to be merged.

The residual dependence of GeometricTimingDet on the DDD class ```DDSolidShape``` is removed through the provided map, and ```cms::DDSolidShape``` is now used. No impact is expected outside of ```Geometry/MTDNumberingBuilder```.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe MTD geometry unit tests are ok, test wf 23234.0 runs smoothly. The full output of the ```MTDNumberingBuilder``` test shows the expected change in shape of polycones:\r\n\r\n```\r\n71c71\r\n<  shape = DDSolidShape index:5, name: Polycone_rz\r\n---\r\n>  shape = DDSolidShape index:7, name: Polycone_rrz\r\n127c127\r\n<  shape = DDSolidShape index:5, name: Polycone_rz\r\n---\r\n>  shape = DDSolidShape index:7, name: Polycone_rrz\r\n183c183\r\n<  shape = DDSolidShape index:5, name: Polycone_rz\r\n---\r\n>  shape = DDSolidShape index:7, name: Polycone_rrz\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich anyway should have no practical effect on the model built in memory and its use.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1595915575", "comments": 24, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1595238958", "deletions": 8, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "a00184133e8cbad79d5120c50706a752fefe2425", "merged_at": "1595915575", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 30834, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "MTD Geometry: updated GeometricTimingDet to remove the residual dependency on DDSolidShape", "updated_at": "1595915576", "user": "fabiocos"}

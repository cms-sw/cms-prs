SoftDrop subjets are derived from AK8 jets).\n- fixes minor inconsistencies in TopTagInfo handling\n\nObserved increase in the event size is at sub-per-mille level (tested on 9k events from /RelValProdTTbar_13/CMSSW_7_4_0_pre8-MCRUN2_74_V7-v1/AODSIM).\n\n@gpetruc @arizzi @rappoccio @dmajumder\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_4_X", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1426929635", "comments": 17, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1426641249", "deletions": 18, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "14f1b03dbfce21900cd904ada405123e228bf4d6", "merged_at": "1426929635", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_4_X", "number": 8370, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "MiniAOD b-tag tweaks", "updated_at": "1426951164", "user": "ferencek"}

This should help reason about the thread-safety of those classes.\n\nAdded our own version of `propagate_const` which is under consideration for `C++17` as is in the `experimental` namespace for gcc and clang. This allows one force pointer like objects to only give `const` access to their pointed to object when using a `const` pointer.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 28, "closed_at": "1450758770", "comments": 13, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1450637926", "deletions": 164, "labels": ["comparison-available", "core-approved", "dqm-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "c034bb3da5e9eba0f5c928dde425321ccc9185e5", "merged_at": "1450758770", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 12836, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Const correct Principal", "updated_at": "1452091816", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

We recently decided to sync the electron and photon regressions and the electron object did not have the 2x5 shower shapes, which are being added. I also added the saturation information that is now added as input for the regression (in both GsfElectron and Photon. This is a smaller big change, because it has to be propagated to miniAOD, which is also done here.", "branch": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "changed_files": 365, "closed_at": "1487029578", "comments": 25, "commits": 117, "created_at": "1485955895", "deletions": 39094, "labels": ["alca-pending", "analysis-pending", "comparison-pending", "core-pending", "db-pending", "dqm-pending", "generators-pending", "l1-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending", "upgrade-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "number": 17370, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "Add 2x5 shower-shape and saturation info for electrons and photons", "updated_at": "1487029579", "user": "rafaellopesdesa"}

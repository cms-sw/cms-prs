This PR fixes this problem. Additional updates on the functionality are done.\r\n\r\n- new implementation of trigger tools using HLTConfigProvider to automatically find last filter of trigger path. This way the filter name has not explicitly specified.\r\n- removing era modifier as they are not needed for current run 3 data taking.\r\n- moving z counting to electrons into a separate plugin. This way the z counting to muons is concise. The plugin for electrons does not function yet but is planned to be updated in the future.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\ncmsDriver.py\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

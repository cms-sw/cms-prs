EM clusters are formed correctly, charged pions look fine, simple jet gun multi-particle response is as before. \nNo changes in energies.\n\nWith DQM the event time in TTBar + 140 PU is at ~5 minutes per event. \nIs this OK for now?\n\nNB: I had to turn off the gsf electron tracking since there's no notion of preselection for the HGC clusters. This was causing the electron seeding and track fitting to run very slowly.\n\n@vandreev11 @pfs @amagnan @bsunanda\n", "branch": "CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "changed_files": 26, "closed_at": "1405960968", "comments": 2, "commits": 12, "created_at": "1405900776", "deletions": 656, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending", "visualization-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "cd2133c02d6ff1b595894954f1b79e5f41f5108f", "merged_at": "1405960968", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_6_2_X_SLHC", "number": 4715, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Massive HGC Clustering speed/memory improvements", "updated_at": "1405960968", "user": "lgray"}

This PR prevents weight duplication by setting `Pythia8ToHepMC::set_store_weights(false)` and keeps the old weight structure the same as in UL by push_back 0th weight manually. Fixes #36705\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested with the workflow `555`,  `556`\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nThis PR is intended for 12_4_X (otherwise the Pythia8 MC will contain duplicated PS weights in the weight containers)\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1652949965", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["generators-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 38012, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Push_back 0th weight manually, prevent duplication of PS weights in P8.30x", "updated_at": "1653262618", "user": "SanghyunKo"}

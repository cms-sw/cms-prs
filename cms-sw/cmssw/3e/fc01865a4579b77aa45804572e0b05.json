In the same way, the `boost::ptr_list<T>` can be replaced by a `std::list<std::unique_ptr<T>>`.\r\n\r\nThe only place in CMSSW where `ptr_vector` and `ptr_list` were still used was the `RecoTauTag/RecoTau` package, so this PR replaces all occurrences of these boost pointer collections in CMSSW. Note that `transfer` method from the boost pointer collections can be replaced with the [`std::move` overload for collection](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/move), which was done in this PR.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCMSSW compiles.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nNo backport intended.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 17, "closed_at": "1634945594", "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1634476603", "deletions": 166, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "ea43e076728bd8385f64f607ddb5b0bfcfbbaa79", "merged_at": "1634945594", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "number": 35708, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Replace `boost::ptr_vector` and `boost::ptr_list` with STL collections in RecoTauTag/RecoTau", "updated_at": "1634945594", "user": "guitargeek"}

With my developments the duplication lead to failures in python. ~~This PR clones the module when adding it in `SwitchProducerCUDA`.~~ This PR moves the definition of what was `pixelTracksCPU` module inside the definition of `pixelTracksSoA` `SwitchProducerCUDA`.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe `PixelTracks_cff` file passes python with my developments.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1649976408", "comments": 24, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1649882830", "deletions": 9, "labels": ["hlt-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved", "heterogeneous-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "810550098ef263e4d920dc0d50f1d2209c85d52f", "merged_at": "1649976408", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 37562, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "Move pixelTracksCPU module definition inside SwitchProducerCUDA", "updated_at": "1649976408", "user": "makortel"}

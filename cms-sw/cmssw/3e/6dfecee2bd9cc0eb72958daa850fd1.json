It is just about relaxing few thresholds in python config with no changes in c++ source code.  A modifier has been added to access the low pt photon reconstruction. Photon and electron efficiency plots and timing with default and modified reconstruction can be found in slides [1] presented in Reconstruction and Analysis Tools meeting. The modified reconstruction has been reviewed by Egamma POG convener @Sam-Harper .\r\n[1]https://indico.cern.ch/event/836517/contributions/3513898/attachments/1887027/3111085/cms_reco_meeting_26thJuly_2019.pdf  \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 17, "closed_at": "1566501991", "comments": 57, "commits": 9, "created_at": "1564410214", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "operations-approved", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "b5741be82263308b5c537b6acfbcfdf72c21afbe", "merged_at": "1566501991", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 27633, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 7, "state": "closed", "title": "Light by light modifier 1100 pre1", "updated_at": "1567404586", "user": "rchudasa"}

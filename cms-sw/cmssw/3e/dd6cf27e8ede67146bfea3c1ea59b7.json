This PR adds:\r\n- the sum operation for the energy expressed in number of MIPs;\r\n- the sum in quadrature of the noise between calibration and surrounding cells.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nValidated with some private tests using the [hgcal-comm](https://gitlab.cern.ch/hgcal-dpg/hgcal-comm) package, ~~as this piece of code isn't currently exercised by any CMSSW workflow~~ (this is not true anymore). In any case, this PR builds on top of PR #47829 and only adds similar, straightforward sum operations.\r\n\r\n@pfs @fabio-mon\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1765788570", "comments": 12, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1765444232", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved", "hgcal-dpg-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "712e925576cdaabfc2bc3abfb2162b38756f09ee", "merged_at": "1765788570", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_16_0_X", "number": 49598, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add MIPs sum and noise quadratic sum to HGCAL calibration cell handler", "updated_at": "1765788571", "user": "RSalvatico"}

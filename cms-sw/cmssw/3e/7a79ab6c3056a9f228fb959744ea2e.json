Summary, the E/gamma energy regression is using the wrong H/E value. \r\n\r\nThis PR makes it use the uncorrected value. This is the correct value for UL Run2 samples and the upcoming 2024 regression. \r\n\r\nThis is the wrong value for current Run3 regression but the current variable is also wrong for the Run3 regression so this is just different wrong. \r\n\r\nThe effect on real electrons, particularly those well measured, should be small. The effect on jets and  missmeasured electrons is higher but the value should be comparible physics wise to the old one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\ntested as part of:\r\nhttps://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/45470", "branch": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1721652859", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "number": 45526, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Use uncorrected H/E for electron energy regressions: 140X", "updated_at": "1721652884", "user": "Sam-Harper"}

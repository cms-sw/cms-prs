None of the test code in `HeterogeneousCore/AlpakaTest` uses `std::move()` in conjunction with `return`, so I think it is good to remove it from the example.\r\n\r\nThis also fixes one link.\r\n\r\nResolves https://github.com/cms-sw/framework-team/issues/1091\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nNone", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1731767386", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1731693372", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved", "heterogeneous-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "f43acb871d242fd9f9b812fbe2dc8c656c9f6dfc", "merged_at": "1731767386", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_14_2_X", "number": 46711, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Minor updates to AlpakaCore README", "updated_at": "1731767387", "user": "makortel"}

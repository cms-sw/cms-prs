As a consequence, `PixelTrackFilter` objects are constructed from EDModule constructos in order to deliver `edm::ConsumesCollector`. In addition, `edm::EventSetup` is always delivered in `PixelTrackFilter::update`, and it is up to the deriving class to use it or not (previously `edm::EventSetup` was delivered in the `PixelTrackFilter` constructor if needed).\n\nConfiguration parameter `useFilterWithES` in `PixelTrackReconstruction` class became obsolete, I added LogInfo message for that.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 20, "closed_at": "1387299500", "comments": 6, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1387268308", "deletions": 79, "labels": ["fastsim-approved", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "198696ebe2f996e0e5c3a80fa24c9c93b96f93f6", "merged_at": "1387299500", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_0_0_pre11", "number": 1847, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Migrate PixelTrackFilter classes to getByToken", "updated_at": "1476951372", "user": "makortel"}

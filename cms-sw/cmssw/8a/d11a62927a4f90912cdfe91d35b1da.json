With old implementation despite isAvailable being true, dereferencing would throw if the fwd pointed was dropped.\n\nSee:\nhttps://hypernews.cern.ch/HyperNews/CMS/get/edmFramework/3282.html\n\nSimilar to PR #3850\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1400610593", "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1400046595", "deletions": 9, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "1eaad779431206edb865b1f85d374f27d2da57bb", "merged_at": "1400610593", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_0_X", "number": 3851, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Bugfix for edm::FwdRef", "updated_at": "1403295401", "user": "arizzi"}

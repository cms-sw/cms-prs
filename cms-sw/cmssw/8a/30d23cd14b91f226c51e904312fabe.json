In number of cases sprintf was used and according to compiler\r\nwe were overflowing the buffer (e.g. writing terminating nul after\r\nbuffer).\r\n\r\nI have also noticed that some files container DOS formatting. Thus converted\r\nfiles to UNIX format. Thus for review I suggest just looking at the first commit.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "changed_files": 12, "closed_at": "1486456219", "comments": 10, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1486382070", "deletions": 1912, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "hlt-approved", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "cd89be2b2b1d13d324f10be249cdced84b41da49", "merged_at": "1486456219", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "number": 17423, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix GCC 7 errors and convert to UNIX format", "updated_at": "1486456219", "user": "davidlt"}

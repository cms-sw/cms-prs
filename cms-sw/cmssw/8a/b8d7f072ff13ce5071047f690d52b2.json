As a part of this, in this branch , the track candidate in the (Track Candidate Producer) is initialized using the seed state info instead of the previously used sim-info. The important part to note is that seed state is defined at the last hit of the seed, whereas a track candidate should be initialized with the state at the first hit, so the seed state is first back propagated to the first hit and then used as  initial state for  the track candidate.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1439529381", "comments": 9, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1439353674", "deletions": 17, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fastsim-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "8d5d4abfa5eadf03bc27b5ab2444f1218c63be4f", "merged_at": "1439529381", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 10707, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "seed state back propagated to first rechit and then instead of sim info, seed state info is used", "updated_at": "1465185437", "user": "akapoorcern"}

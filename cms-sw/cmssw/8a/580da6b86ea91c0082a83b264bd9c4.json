This leads calling the script `testCompareSiStripG2Gains.sh` with time-inverted arguments, which then causes crashes in the calls to the `getPayloadData.py` script.   \r\nI fix this possible pitfall by changing the PCL FCSR to the HLT FCSR which is guaranteed to be >= to any possible upload to the production tag (barring upload mistakes). \r\nI profit of this PR to remove a few unneeded import statements. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n`scram b runtests_test_SiStripG2GainsValidator` run as of Oct 16, 2024 22:30 runs fine.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

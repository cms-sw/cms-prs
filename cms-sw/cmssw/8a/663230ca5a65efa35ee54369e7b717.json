So\nSimWatchers use the global CLHEP engine (which is\nthe same thing the current version of GEANT does).\nThis CLHEP global will be a thread_local as soon\nas planned changes are made to CLHEP.\n\nThe Hector code is different because it has TRandom3\nhard coded in its interface, although it turns out\nthat does not really affect the migration.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "changed_files": 12, "closed_at": "1392415906", "comments": 4, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1392308453", "deletions": 102, "labels": ["fully-signed", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "2bc1332a32e22272ec12d800616898ce0f8280c2", "merged_at": "1392415906", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_1_0_pre5", "number": 2457, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Migrate More to New Random Service Interface", "updated_at": "1398449990", "user": "wddgit"}

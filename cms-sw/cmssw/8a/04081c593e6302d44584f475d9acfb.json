As a prerequisite, Trajectory and TempTrajectory are extended to count also found pixel hits (which may have other uses too). \n\nThe SeedExtensionTrajectoryFilter is also extended to act as \"qualityFilter()\" in addition to \"toBeContinued()\". The point is that if seed extension decides that a propagation of a trajectory should be stopped, the trajectory should also be discarded (in my opinion). This way the assumption is enforced without relying on the value of `minimumNumberOfHits` (alternatively we would need `minimumNumberOfPixelHits`). The easiest way to communicate the \"trajectory was stopped because of seed extension\" from `toBeContinued()` to `qualityFilter()` was to use the existing `StoppingReason` enum, so I added a `SEED_EXTENSION` enumerator there.\n\nI updated the tracking DQM for the new `StoppingReason` (*), also adding a run-time check in case new StoppingReasons are added. (Maybe we should eventually abstract the string representation of StoppingReasons similarly to TrackBase::TrackAlgorithm?)\n\n(*) After the \"qualityFilter()\" change we expect to see zero tracks with `SEED_EXTENSION` stopping reason, so the DQM change serves mainly as a sanity check (seeing something there indicates a bug).\n\nTested in CMSSW_8_1_X_2016-05-01-2300 (rebased on top of ~~CMSSW_8_1_X_2016-05-09-2300~~ CMSSW_8_1_X_2016-05-16-2300), no changes expected in standard workflows (new functionality is added but not enabled; StopReason DQM plots show changes because of added bin).\n\n@rovere @VinInn @mtosi \n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 11, "closed_at": "1464070475", "comments": 38, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1462278084", "deletions": 11, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "hlt-approved", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "05011b753203f7501e2a9c3697eb816398ea58ed", "merged_at": "1464070475", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 14356, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "Add pixel-only seed extension", "updated_at": "1492588065", "user": "makortel"}

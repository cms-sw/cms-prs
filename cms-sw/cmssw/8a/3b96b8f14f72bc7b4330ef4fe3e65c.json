However, cleaning the code a bit could help possible further degugging of the same. This is what this PR is intended to.\r\n\r\n@cms-sw/l1-l2 please only consider this PR if it does not interfere with other updates that you are independently implementing in that code to fix the reported issue. Still you can take these simplifications into account for your own code, if so.\r\n\r\nFurther simplifications and or optimizations are also certainly possible for this code!\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nIt compiles and runs on a few Phase2 workflows\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 9, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1662017421", "deletions": 43, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "l1-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_6_X", "number": 39283, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Simplify L1TPhase2MuonOffline and fix the matching with gen muons in it", "updated_at": "1662036744", "user": "perrotta"}

This may point to different issues:\r\n- recalculation of matrix elements at every generation run instead of pre-computing them (a la gridpack), this looks a questionable structural choice;\r\n- according to @efeyazgan openloops seems here much slower than in association with sherpa. Provided the comparison is on a similar process, this might point to some integration issues;\r\n- according to @davidlange6 checks the code is likely not optimal in terms of performances in several places.\r\nIn agreement with @efeyazgan I revert this PR, as it looks pointless. A follow up should be done in view of possible use of this generator configuration in production (it looks quite inefficient).

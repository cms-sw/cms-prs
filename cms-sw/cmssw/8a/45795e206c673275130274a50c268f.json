This cut is more robust against pileup than the sensor occupancy cut used to flag a cluster as merged. We set the cut to -6000 in the config, where 6000 is a reasonable choice to turn on this selection.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_3_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1421415677", "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1421414470", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-rejected", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_3_X", "number": 7224, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Option to use old CPE error if charge exceeds one MIP - 73X", "updated_at": "1421483373", "user": "perrotta"}

In the long run, these python scripts will probably replace the existing files in macros/.\r\n\r\nThe batch scripts used to submit files to LSF were removed.\r\n\r\nSome additional minor tweaks were done to test/autoSubmitter/autoSubmitter.py (adding the possibility to use shortcuts for mp, hp, sm, and prod when loading conditions) and test/batch/startSkim.py (adding option to limit the number of parallel skims).", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 31, "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1542641951", "deletions": 945, "labels": ["alca-pending", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-notrun", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-rejected"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_4_X", "number": 25287, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Added support for condor instead of LSF for APE tool", "updated_at": "1542734391", "user": "mteroerd"}

In the long run, these python scripts will probably replace the existing files in macros/.\r\n\r\nThe batch scripts used to submit files to LSF were removed.\r\n\r\nSome additional minor tweaks were done to test/autoSubmitter/autoSubmitter.py (adding the possibility to use shortcuts for mp, hp, sm, and prod when loading conditions) and test/batch/startSkim.py (adding option to limit the number of parallel skims).", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 31, "closed_at": "1543231126", "comments": 21, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1542641951", "deletions": 945, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "819a388673b0bb37e5a394363ee21b7c58718809", "merged_at": "1543231126", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_4_X", "number": 25287, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "Added support for condor instead of LSF for APE tool", "updated_at": "1543231127", "user": "mteroerd"}

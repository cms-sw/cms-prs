The main features:\n- Add a new 2-D histogram to show the correlation between TT flags and Et deposited in a given trigger tower.\n  - It is a backport of #16206 in CMSSW_8_1_X.\n- Fix issue in offline DQM where FE Status Flag plots only display stats from last LS\n  - Harvesting step in offline DQM causes LS-based plots to only keep stats from the last LS due to multi-threading, which affects all FE Status Flag plots in offline DQM since the introduction of PR  #15411 (starting `CMSSW 8_0_18` or ~run 279498).\n  - Revert changes introduced in that PR: set `ecalRawDataClient.MEs.QualitySummary` and `ecalRawDataTask.MEs.FEStatus` to be run-based again.\n  - To maintain functionality of GOOD channel reporting introduced in that PR, get RawData info instead from `ecalRawDataTask.MEs.FEStatusErrMapByLumi` (introduced later, in PR #16112) which, by design, is already reset every LS, and is filled independently of the affected MEs above.\n  - Originally in #16304: the new commit https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/16205/commits/13c7189766c368143134af7326c8d73c702e481a is a cherry-pick of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/16304/commits/f306f23eb803a619f46e30f1c1b3131637f0d20c so it can be used online.\n  - It is a backport of #16305 in CMSSW_8_1_X.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 19, "closed_at": "1478019701", "comments": 20, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1476379513", "deletions": 19, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "1c62d5b6fa5fd1d5f8eba610759e9827c3cffd5a", "merged_at": "1478019701", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 16205, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Added 2-D histogram of trigger tower flags vs Et; Revert FEStatus to run based: getting LS reports from FEMap instead.", "updated_at": "1478019702", "user": "tanmaymudholkar"}

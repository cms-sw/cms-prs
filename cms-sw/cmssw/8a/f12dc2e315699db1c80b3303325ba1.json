These plots are necessary for the PPS alignment run (23/06/22).\r\nThe added plots follow a similar implementation to an already existing one, just with different parameters.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nThis PR can be validated by running a DQM playback of Run 354054 (currently ongoing). No additional validation is needed, the implementation is almost identical to code that is already implemented.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\nThis is a backport of PR #38435. The backport is necessary because this update needs to be deployed in the P5 Online DQM for the PPS alignment run (23/06/22).\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1656135556", "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1655888055", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "backport-ok", "ctpps"], "merge_commit_sha": "0f2564c19b86de92cd11c6de186089a1c85e1466", "merged_at": "1656135556", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 38465, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Added plots for 2/3 aligned ROCs per BX, backport of PR #38435 ", "updated_at": "1656135556", "user": "AndreaBellora"}

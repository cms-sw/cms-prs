These plots are necessary for the PPS alignment run (23/06/22).\r\nThe added plots follow a similar implementation to an already existing one, just with different parameters.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nThis PR can be validated by running a DQM playback of Run 354054 (currently ongoing). No additional validation is needed, the implementation is almost identical to code that is already implemented.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\nThis is a backport of PR #38435. The backport is necessary because this update needs to be deployed in the P5 Online DQM for the PPS alignment run (23/06/22).\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 4, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1655888055", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "backport-ok"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_4_X", "number": 38465, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Added plots for 2/3 aligned ROCs per BX, backport of PR #38435 ", "updated_at": "1656045470", "user": "AndreaBellora"}

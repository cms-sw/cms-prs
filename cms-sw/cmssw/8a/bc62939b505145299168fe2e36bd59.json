With this PR, the calculated sum of the pTs of the unclustered particles is stored, and can be accessed with metSumPt(), similar to metSignificance().\r\nThis makes a later calculation, e.g. in nanoAOD as proposed in [this PR](https://github.com/cms-nanoAOD/cmssw/pull/443), redundant.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nAll tests have been run, and were passed.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 9, "closed_at": "1574064748", "comments": 66, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1573295716", "deletions": 23, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "703f4fc1732e0410acad217a4acc70c739a8741e", "merged_at": "1574064748", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 28370, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 5, "state": "closed", "title": "Keeping sumPt from MET Significance calculation", "updated_at": "1586373865", "user": "danbarto"}

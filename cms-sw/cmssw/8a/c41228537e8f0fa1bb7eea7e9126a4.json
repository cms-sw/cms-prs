Further investigation showed that these counters are incremented in `TFile`'s read functions, but our `TStorageFactoryFile` didn't touch those counters. Updating the `TStorageFactoryFile`'s read functions to update ROOT's counters made the `TTreeCache::Print(\"a\")` to show non-zero numbers.\r\n\r\nResolves https://github.com/cms-sw/framework-team/issues/1392\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n`TTreeCache::Print(\"a\")` shows non-zero values in private tests.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 6, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1747244085", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["core-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 48082, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Update ROOT counters in TStorageFactoryFile read functions", "updated_at": "1747251485", "user": "makortel"}

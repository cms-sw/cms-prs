PUPPI jets are clustered based on standard PF candidates together with the value map of weights. A new boolean \"isWeighted\" is added to the reco::Jet interface to indicate whether weights were applied during jet clustering. The packed candidates pick up the value map such that puppi does not need to be re-computed in MiniAOD.\r\n\r\nThe same can be done for the puppiNoLep and PUPPI MET in a separate PR (to keep this one as slim as possible).\r\n\r\nOther changes:\r\n- Removing AK8CHS from RECO\r\n- Removing CMSTopTagger from RECO\r\n- slimmedJetsPuppi: Removing puppi multiplictiy user floats and store the directly in jet specifics rounded to integers (this is enough for jet ID purposes anyways).\r\n- slimmedJetsAK8: Remove all user float related to AK8CHS\r\n- Implement BoostedDoubleSVProducer::fillDescriptions\r\n- Fix HLT configuration of hltBoostedDBSVAK8TagInfosPF in HLT_GRun_cff. This needs to be followed up and fixed everywhere in HLT #29203.\r\n- HOEnergyFraction for PUPPI jets is adapted to account for the PUPPI weight\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nrunTheMatrix -l limited\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nNo backport planned.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 57, "closed_at": "1585073341", "comments": 228, "commits": 57, "created_at": "1581532120", "deletions": 583, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "hlt-approved", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "277cb56baa2e8187367f1897cdc3405c998ec2de", "merged_at": "1585073341", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 28936, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 36, "state": "closed", "title": "PUPPI jets in RECO", "updated_at": "1585226330", "user": "ahinzmann"}

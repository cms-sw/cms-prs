The most important additional change on top #15809 changes ConfigBuilder.py and therefore could have a larger impact on the evaluation of this pull request as opposed to #15809.\n\nThe ConfigBuilder.py change always makes the dqmoffline*_step path be an EndPath. Previously, based on which processing step is being configured the dqmoffline*_step might sometimes be a Path and other times be an EndPath. The reason appeared to be because sometimes the TriggerResults was being requested by some modules using an empty processName and the hope was one would pick up the HLT results. This change has all modules explicitly state what process name to use when getting the TriggerResults. \n\nThis is needed since the next threaded framework change requires that the consumes of a module and its place on a Path or EndPath guarantee that it can get all the data it requests (or will fail since there is no source or module producing the data it wants). Asking for a TriggerResults for the present process from a Path is therefore not allowed (and was not a good idea before either).\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1474030644", "comments": 18, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1473626864", "deletions": 23, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "851461bd79ace5087f390d4f3c5ffb2cc92b555d", "merged_at": "1474030643", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 15810, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix all DQM paths to properly handle TriggerResults", "updated_at": "1476860084", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

It takes the `TrackingRegion` creation, cluster number check, and doublet/triplet/quadruplet generation out of the seed generator, and makes each of them an EDProducer. The regions, decision of the cluster number check, and the hit doublets/triplets are delivered to subsequent components via `edm::Event`.\r\n\r\nThe implementation is fully backwards compatible, i.e. all existing configurations should work out of the box. Instances of `SeedGeneratorFromRegionHitsEDProducer` can be migrated one at a time. Here the offline iterative tracking is fully migrated (including, with minimal effort, knock-on effects in FastSim and HI), but nothing else (e.g. HLT) is not (yet).\r\n### Pros\r\n- Much more flexibility in interfaces (not more constrained by \"common denominator\")\r\n- `fillDescriptions` fully supported\r\n- For `PixelQuadrupletGenerator`, removes repetitive doublet generation of certain layer pairs\r\n- For `CAHit*Generator`\r\n  - Allows fast regional ntuplet finding\r\n    - No need to do everything per region, but fill CA from all doublets and find ntuplets for all regions simultaneously on one go\r\n  - Allows (easily) to put (e.g.) quadruplets and triplets, found simulateneously on one go, to `Event` as separate collections\r\n    - Can be exploited to reduce repetitive hit triplet generation between iterations\r\n- Allows \"medium-grained\" parallelization\r\n- Opens further optimization possibilities\r\n### Cons\r\n- Additional data structures to deliver information between modules\r\n- More modules to manage in configuration\r\n### Subsequent steps\r\n- Do similar transformation to `PixelTrackProducer`\r\n  - Additional complication from adding fillDescriptions support for fitter, filter, and cleaner\r\n- Migrate all seeding and pixel track modules in HLT (in `customizeHLTforCMSSW.py`)\r\n### Expected effect\r\n\r\nTested in CMSSW_8_1_X_2016-10-04-1100 (rebased on top of CMSSW_8_1_X_2016-11-08-2300), no changes expected in monitored quantities. The expected speedup in 10224 (2017 ttbar+PU) seeding is ~2-3 %. The expected memory increase is ~10 MB (based on IgProf LIVE, `SimpleMemoryCheck` on 6 threads gives similar order of magnitude although across-event variations are larger).\r\n\r\n@rovere @VinInn @mtosi @felicepantaleo \r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 137, "closed_at": "1479390010", "comments": 63, "commits": 63, "created_at": "1476351108", "deletions": 1401, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "dqm-pending", "fastsim-pending", "hlt-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 16202, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 56, "state": "closed", "title": "New seeding framework", "updated_at": "1479390010", "user": "makortel"}

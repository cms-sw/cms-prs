This PR does not touch production code.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1623189504", "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1623158418", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "56771686c0cf36e5a1958352df34484fe52b2eba", "merged_at": "1623189504", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "number": 34029, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Reduced excessive number of iterations in test.", "updated_at": "1623189505", "user": "ericcano"}

Bad-quality tracks are discarded later on ( https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/CMSSW_13_1_0_pre2/RecoPixelVertexing/PixelTrackFitting/plugins/PixelTrackProducerFromSoA.cc#L190 )\r\nThis PR sorts by pT only tracks with good quality. \r\nThis should avoid the risk of crash due to sorting tracks with uninitialized parameters.\r\n\r\nAs bad-quality tracks are discarded, this PR should have no effects on physics results.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nAdded a debug printout in `storeTracks(iEvent, tracks, httopo);` and no changes are observed, as expected.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if a backport is necessary. Perhaps it would good to have it for 13_2_X (HIon).\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1690801386", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "tracking"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_3_X", "number": 42428, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "sort by pt only good-quality tracks", "updated_at": "1690801755", "user": "silviodonato"}

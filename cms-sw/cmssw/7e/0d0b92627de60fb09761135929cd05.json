I'm not entirely convinced by the name `Phase2Dev`, if anyone wants it changed please comment here.\n\nPut in on 7_6_X, not sure if it should be 8_0_X only?\n\nCurrently no changes added to either scenario, I thought integration would be easier if that was done in separate pull requests.  Note that this includes #12124 otherwise there would probably be merge conflicts (EDIT - now no longer true; decoupled from #12124).\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1446632956", "comments": 14, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1446123650", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-rejected"], "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 12169, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add Phase1 pixel and Phase2 (2023) eras", "updated_at": "1446745286", "user": "mark-grimes"}

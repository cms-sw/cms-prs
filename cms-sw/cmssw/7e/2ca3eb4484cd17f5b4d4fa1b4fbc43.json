As we (Pixel / Tracker) support 0T conditions for both CRUZET (and eventually 0T collisions data, as it might be foreseeable in the scenario of Run-3 startup [*] in which there is a pilot run in 2021) it is important to not introduce bugs in the 0T data reconstruction, which if untested for long time might hit production workflows.\r\nI introduce in this PR, simulation workflows for comics (`wf 7.24`) and collisions (w/o PU , `wf 11634.24` and w/ PU - std mixing, `wf 11834.24`) in the 2021 scenario.\r\nTo achieve this, a new class `UpgradeWorkflow_0T` is introduced in ` Configuration/PyReleaseValidation/python/upgradeWorkflowComponents.py ` and also several new symbolic global tags (derived from the existing `auto:phase*` keys) supporting the 0T case (via appending of the 0T version of the `RunInfo` payload).\r\nI provide below a comparison of the parmateres for the 0T and 3.8T `RunInfo` payloads: \r\n\r\n| 0T payload | 3.8T payload |\r\n| ------------- | ------------- |\r\n| `RunInfo_0T_v1_mc` | `RunInfo_v1_mc` |\r\n| ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5082376/86472486-8890c600-bd3f-11ea-987a-de35f79bb99a.png) | ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5082376/86472696-de656e00-bd3f-11ea-9791-27a34c9a461a.png) |\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis branch has been tested by running:\r\n```\r\nrunTheMatrix.py -l 7.24,11634.24,11834.24 -t 4 -j 8 --ibeos\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\n\r\n[*] [link](https://indico.cern.ch/event/918265/contributions/3902925/attachments/2055632/3446814/WGM454_SPteam_Status_report.pdf)", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1594099483", "comments": 22, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1593775443", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "pdmv-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "831cb2d257c53aeeaf70df227a11f9ce3d93a22c", "merged_at": "1594099483", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 30527, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 4, "state": "closed", "title": "integrate 0T workflows for Cosmics and Collisions", "updated_at": "1594099483", "user": "mmusich"}

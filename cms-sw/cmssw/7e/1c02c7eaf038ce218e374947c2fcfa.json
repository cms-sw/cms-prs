This PR proposes to define `CMS_USE_AVX2` instead of `CMS_USE_AVX` when `__AVX2__` is available. \r\n\r\nThis change should not have any effects of normal cmssw builds as we build with `-msse3` however this should fix the `SKYLAKEAVX512` IBs which are now build for `sandybridge,haswell,skylake-avx512`\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1616858812", "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1616668830", "deletions": 22, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "057154bee347e68c60419c862895bbde3fe13c04", "merged_at": "1616858812", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 33268, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Use CMS_USE_AVX2 instead of CMS_USE_AVX", "updated_at": "1616858812", "user": "smuzaffar"}

The if statement had an empty body! I cleaned up the source\ncode by removing all references of subdetswitchtotdigiproflson.\nAccording GIT it's not used anywhere in CMSSW (apart that empty if\nstatement).\n\nSigned-off-by: David Abdurachmanov David.Abdurachmanov@cern.ch\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_3_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1411392250", "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1411368646", "deletions": 9, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "cd758415bc0b5ee243bf3045e8382c49850daa21", "merged_at": "1411392250", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_7_3_X", "number": 5462, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "DQM/SiStripMonitorDigi: remove unsued subdetswitchtotdigiproflson", "updated_at": "1411408688", "user": "deguio"}

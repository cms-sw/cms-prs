It adds SoA formats for PFClusters and PFRecHitFractions as well as an Alpaka based producer for them. The module relies on the usage of the PFRecHitProducer introduced in the #42807. Included is an alpaka process modifier to use for cmsDriver commands. `--procModifiers alpaka` will replace the existing HCAL PF clustering with a chain using alpaka modules. We plan an additional follow up to read HCAL thresholds from DB in this module once the changes in #43025 converge.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nWe have performed extensive validation of the PF Clusters and their use in the full PF Validation outlined in `Validation/RecoParticleFlow/`.\r\n\r\nWe observe only minor precision based energy differences in the clusters which have no significant impact to relevant PF outputs. \r\n\r\nValidation plots are linked here: https://hep.baylor.edu/jsamudio/pfClusterProducerAlpakaValidation/\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

To suppress these gamma (they mainly produced by muons and pions in annihilation at rest) an extra tracking cut is added. By default all gamma a with E<100 eV are killed, for neutron background study all gamma below 500 eV are killed.\n\nFor neutron background study all ions with energy below 1 keV are killed as well.\n\nThis should not affect results of mainstream simulation but should protect from very low-energy gamma slow transport. This PR also include PR  4270, which is not yet integrated. \n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1403016521", "comments": 7, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1402993663", "deletions": 7, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "b37c2d5728960b95ae02daaf3f311f7ec5ad7373", "merged_at": "1403016521", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_1_0", "number": 4288, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix for inf loop neutron bgr sim", "updated_at": "1403016521", "user": "civanch"}

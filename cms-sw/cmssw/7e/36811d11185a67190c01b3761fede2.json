This PR switches to using GEM clusters instead of GEM pads in the GEM-CSC local trigger. For now I'm keeping the option to run directly on GEM pads in the code because it may be useful in the optimization of the cluster selection.\r\n\r\nEDIT: I turned the useCluster option off again. While ME1/1 looks good, there is a feature in ME2/1 that I need to investigate further. I do need the C++ code.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI ran matrix test 22034.0. I also tested the efficiency in high pileup simulations (PU200). LCT efficiency shows <1% drop in efficiency due to overflow of the GEM cluster collection.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n@tahuang1991 ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 10, "closed_at": "1579613009", "comments": 27, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1576039079", "deletions": 40, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "322a8a15b319dd20f7ffc192b199148b20083de9", "merged_at": "1579613009", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 28605, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Use GEM clusters in the GEM-CSC local trigger", "updated_at": "1579613009", "user": "dildick"}

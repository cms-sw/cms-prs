The code is inspired to the corresponding functionalities in the ECAL Barrel EBDetId, which is conceptually very similar.\r\n\r\nThe test code in Geometry/MTDCommonData has been updated to as to dump the new information and test the consistency of a BTLDetId built from the hashed index with the original one (verified both for scenario D24 and D25).\r\n\r\nThe code is at present function of a layout parameter that allows it to work for both scenarios. It will be cleaned as soon as the choice of the scenario is finally made.\r\n\r\nNo change is expected on the existing functionalities.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "comments": 33, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1534088490", "deletions": 18, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "geometry-approved", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_3_X", "number": 24271, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 20, "state": "open", "title": "MTD DetId: add methods to BTLDetId (hashed index, phi-eta geometric indexes)", "updated_at": "1535373866", "user": "fabiocos"}

This PR adds the requirement for the `LazyGetter::fill()` to be `const`.\r\n\r\nThe only deriving class (beyond tests) is `ClusterFiller` defined in `RecoLocalTracker/SiStripClusterizer/plugins/ClustersFromRawProducer.cc`. As far as I can tell, the use of `buffers` and `done` is thread safe, so I added the necessary `mutable` type specifiers there. Having the `fill()` function as `const` helps to reason about thread safety, because now nothing else there needs to be understood that well (assuming everything else used by the `fill()` function is `const`-thread-safe) to conclude the function is thread safe.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCode compiles.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

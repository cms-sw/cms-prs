This means that the input file was not loaded and the module would have added only empty objects to the records. This PR changes the module type to a `edm::one::EDAnalyzer<edm::one::WatchRuns>` in order to call the `beginRun()` function. The configuration file, which had been outdated, was updated to send the correct parameters to the module.\r\nIn addition, the config file for readEcalDQMStatus was removed since the EcalDQMStatusReader module it is supposed to configure does not exist in CMSSW.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis module is run manually only and it has been tested by running the `DQM/EcalCommon/data/writeEcalDQMStatus.py` configuration, which is configured to produce an sqlite file with the two records.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1632987892", "comments": 20, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1632897045", "deletions": 77, "labels": ["dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "7a2f691fc4f6475f2832124c97100ec8d7753677", "merged_at": "1632987892", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "number": 35466, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix EcalDQMStatusWriter to watch runs and load the input file", "updated_at": "1632987892", "user": "thomreis"}

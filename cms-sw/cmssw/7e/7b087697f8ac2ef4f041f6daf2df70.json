In case of MC, they do as unpacked data collection is empty.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1494917289", "comments": 24, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1494535621", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-pending", "l1-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "e0c1840ab78ce4bc950f9621f0c3b805744f28f4", "merged_at": "1494917289", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_2_X", "number": 18703, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "Pr92x L1T UnpackerCaloLayer1 & DQMCaloLayer1 Adjust for Non-present FED data in MC", "updated_at": "1494917290", "user": "rekovic"}

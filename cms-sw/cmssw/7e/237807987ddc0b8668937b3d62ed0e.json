The refined collections override the existing values, but the original values are stored in NANO in an [X]_unrefined branch. This is needed for NANO-v15 FastSim production. \r\n\r\nI note that most likely the complementary PR in cms-data, namely https://github.com/cms-data/PhysicsTools-NanoAOD/pull/20, also needs to be backported to some release, but I'm not sure how that pairing is made. Maybe (hopefully) I'm wrong and it doesn't need to be backported. \r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1771594700", "comments": 3, "commits": 12, "created_at": "1770564007", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "xpog-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_0_X", "number": 50070, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Backport fastsim PUPPI Jet refinement to C14_0_X for NANO-v15", "updated_at": "1771594701", "user": "sbein"}

In order to remove this last vestige of boost::shared_ptr,\nusers of EventSetup need to be converted to std::shared_ptr. This PR does this for L1 packages, and the necessary changes to DB that the L1 changes require. Also, std::make_shared is implemented where it makes sense, because it simplifies the code and saves a memory allocation.\nThis PR is totally technical.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 178, "closed_at": "1460107746", "comments": 6, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1459953340", "deletions": 587, "labels": ["alca-pending", "comparison-available", "db-pending", "l1-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-rejected"], "merge_commit_sha": "1f2105553525bb59622ea88bcb45d3e4378dba82", "merged_at": "1460107746", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 13965, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Use std::shared_ptr in EventSetup interface (L1 and DB)", "updated_at": "1464230092", "user": "wmtan"}

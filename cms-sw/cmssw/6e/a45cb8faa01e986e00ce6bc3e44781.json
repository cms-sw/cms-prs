Elsewhere I have changed the strings by hand.\n\nRight now this switch results in very slow CMSSW run times, due to invoking the compiler.\nNo memory improvements seen yet since boost::spirit (and resulting calls to TCling) still hangs around in memory.\n\nAlso, this breaks igprof as it exists right now.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 129, "closed_at": "1442564647", "comments": 38, "commits": 22, "created_at": "1442440144", "deletions": 956, "labels": ["alca-pending", "analysis-pending", "comparison-available", "dqm-pending", "generators-pending", "hlt-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-rejected"], "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 11303, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "Remove boost spirit from StringCutObjectParser", "updated_at": "1442577445", "user": "lgray"}

HcalMitigation for the photon and electron are also enabled by default and the corresponding PF modifier is redefined to allow the mitigation to be turned off.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThese updates were validated through building in CMSSW_11_3_X and by running\r\n``` \r\nrunTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n\r\n@hatakeyamak @rappoccio @bendavid @marksan87 \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 12, "closed_at": "1618844151", "comments": 23, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1618239456", "deletions": 32, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "operations-approved", "orp-approved", "pdmv-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "c0a5824166b7197973043bf66d9a6d64cd8a7c71", "merged_at": "1618844151", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "number": 33413, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Make BadHcalMitigation enabled by default", "updated_at": "1618844152", "user": "laurenhay"}

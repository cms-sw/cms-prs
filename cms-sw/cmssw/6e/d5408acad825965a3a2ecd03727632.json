These are not used in the building of the mustache supercluster, which is the only supercluster algorithm used online at the moment, also for Phase2. Nevertheless, this is still a nasty bug and could cause problems in the future - they are in fact used for example for the DNN supercluster in [PFECALSuperClusterAlgo](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/631818abebaf8c4665619acbadc8ebd9e8a9d80e/RecoEcal/EgammaClusterAlgos/src/PFECALSuperClusterAlgo.cc#L142-L144).\r\n\r\nI have not found offline modules with the same issue - I think they are all created by the fillDescription of the [PFECALSuperClusterProducer](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/631818abebaf8c4665619acbadc8ebd9e8a9d80e/RecoEcal/EgammaClusterProducers/src/PFECALSuperClusterProducer.cc#L383-L384), which is correct.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, note that the modules `hltParticleFlowSuperClusterECALL1Seeded` and `hltParticleFlowSuperClusterECALUnseeded` in ConfDB present the same issue and should be fixed as well.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nAs explained above, I would not expect to see differences.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 4, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1726040051", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["hlt-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_2_X", "number": 45973, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Fix mismatch between EB and EE recHits in Phase2 supercluster producer configs", "updated_at": "1726041516", "user": "RSalvatico"}

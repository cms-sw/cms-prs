It updates the Phase2 Global Tag (`auto:phase2_realistic`) in autoCond to add the Tracker Alignment Records for Phase2 (earlier we had the Phase1 tags. See https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/41072).\r\n\r\nThe new GT has the following tags which are for the default geometry (i.e. T21 currently)\r\n- `TrackerAlignment_Upgrade2026_T21_design_v0` \r\n- `TrackerAlignmentErrorsExtended_Upgrade2026_T21_design_v0` \r\n- `TrackerSurfaceDeformations_Upgrade2026_Zero`\r\n\r\n **The difference with the latest GT is here**:\r\n- https://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/131X_mcRun4_realistic_v1/131X_mcRun4_realistic_v2\r\n\r\n**and the comparison with the GT before the removal of Phase1 TkAl Rcds in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/41072 is** \r\n- https://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/130X_mcRun4_realistic_v3/131X_mcRun4_realistic_v2\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nTested the GT locally with `runTheMatrix.py -l 23234.0 -j10 --ibeos` which consumes `auto:phase2_realistic_T21`\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

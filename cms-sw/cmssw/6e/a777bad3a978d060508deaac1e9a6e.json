This wish came up for machine learning studies targeting per-LS data certification or online monitoring.\r\n\r\nIn prompt reco, we have per-LS DQM output available due to how Tier0 processes only ~1 LS per job, and the per-job DQMIO output files are available. It would be very nice to have the same granularity of data preserved for the UL rereco, which in addition provides the full run2 dataset processed using the same software.\r\n\r\nFor now, I am not sure which sort of behaviour changes this change brings; in theory, harvesting should reconstruct the per-run statistics from the per-lumi snapshots, but we might need to switch some more flags here and there.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nWaiting for a detailed DQM output comparison, to see which types of MEs cause trouble when forced per-lumi. Will need some special attention during relval since the DQMIO output file size will increase.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "comments": 26, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1553186370", "deletions": 62, "labels": ["code-checks-rejected", "comparison-pending", "dqm-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 26232, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[RFC] Save DQM output per lumisection for UL rereco", "updated_at": "1553590610", "user": "schneiml"}

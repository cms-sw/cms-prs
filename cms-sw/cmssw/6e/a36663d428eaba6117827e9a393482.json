This was brought into our attention by TSG colleagues and it was causing unrealistic rates when re-emulating data after 2023A. \r\n\r\nThere might be an underlying reason to why this problem started happening, but for the time being we prefer to remove this option and use `unpackHcal` directly. This is more in line with how ECAL TPs are used. The `unpackLayer1` step was probably an artifact from Run 2, which is not needed anymore.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nValidated that the `L1REPACK:Full` workflows still work after the change and the rates obtained are as expected.\r\n\r\nFYI @missirol @savarghe @caruta @aloeliger @epalencia ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1708008697", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["operations-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 43981, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Remove unpackLayer1 option from L1REPACK:Full", "updated_at": "1708009356", "user": "eyigitba"}

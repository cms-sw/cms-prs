This pixel tracking sequence has been requested to meet physics goals requiring low-pt tracks with a higher purity than what is achievable with full tracks.  The additional pixel tracking modules have been found to have a negligible impact on the total timing.  Storing the extra track collection has been estimated to increase the event content size of AOD by 11%, which is a number the HI PAG is willing to accept.  Details of the pixel tracking performance in MB HI events can be found at [1].\r\n\r\nThe PR can be tested with the normal pp_on_AA_2018 cmsDriver command with the era changed to the 'Run2_2018_pp_on_AA_wPixelTrk'.\r\n\r\n[1] https://indico.cern.ch/event/749011/contributions/3098671/attachments/1698408/2736177/pixelUpdate_20180727.pdf\r\n\r\n@mandrenguyen ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1534963182", "comments": 34, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1533811830", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "operations-pending", "orp-approved", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "707c4234d5067f6a44bf5de907d844045df61e27", "merged_at": "1534963182", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_3_X", "number": 24257, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "Addition of pixel Tracking in HI pp_on_AA_2018 era", "updated_at": "1534963182", "user": "abaty"}

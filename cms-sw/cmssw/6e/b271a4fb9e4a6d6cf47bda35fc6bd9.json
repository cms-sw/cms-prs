The classes are renamed to EcalEBFenix* to follow the package name they are in.\r\n\r\nWhile running the matrix tests for PR #33349 the Phase 2 WF showed differences to the baseline. It was noticed that the Phase 1 EcalFenix headers in `SimCalorimetry/EcalTrigPrimAlgos` and the Phase 2 EcalFenix headers in `SimCalorimetry/EcalEBTrigPrimAlgos` were previously identical, including the include guards.\r\nWith the changes to the Phase 1 TP emulator in PR #33349 the Phase 2 functions were used in some WFs in the Phase 1 code instead of the Phase 1 ones, leading to failing tests for Phase 2 WFs.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nPasses Phase 2 WF 23234.0 matrix test.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 14, "closed_at": "1618296905", "comments": 22, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1618174601", "deletions": 167, "labels": ["bug-fix", "code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved", "urgent"], "merge_commit_sha": "645f53d897db2c83a9235ad8b548e00d8b839db0", "merged_at": "1618296905", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 33403, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 6, "state": "closed", "title": "Ecal Phase 2 TP algo EcalFenix class renames", "updated_at": "1618296905", "user": "thomreis"}

As this distinction is no longer required, the loop is no longer needed - removal will reduce resource usage.\r\nAlso, only the cluster charge is plotted now, as the \"corrected\" charge requires track parameter information and the former ought to be sufficient for validation purposes.\r\n\r\n@fioriNTU, @boudoul and @slava77 will be interested in this.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1507047431", "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1506534762", "deletions": 49, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "575a47c1dc033097d7d5fbda7e2fe14f71ee98b9", "merged_at": "1507047431", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_4_X", "number": 20680, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Phase1 pixel validation cluster loop fix", "updated_at": "1507047431", "user": "davidcarbonis"}

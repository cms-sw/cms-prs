The next step from my side, once this MinBias sample will have been created, will be to make use of the new mixing scheme in a workflow to be used for validation, as agreed during a PPD meeting.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1402835093", "comments": 7, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1402422195", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fastsim-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "ed878dcff4515c5771b7a72fdacf105d9c90b289", "merged_at": "1402835093", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_1_0", "number": 4197, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "New fastsim event content for pileup", "updated_at": "1402835093", "user": "giamman"}

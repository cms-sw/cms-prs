These member functions were originally kept for backwards compatibility with the old `ElectronSeed` class so the new `ElectronSeed` could be quickly integrated without adapting function calls in all of CMSSW. in Probably it's now a good time for removing them.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCMSSW compiles.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\n\r\nNo backport intended.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 12, "closed_at": "1571375700", "comments": 14, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1571308812", "deletions": 128, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "hlt-approved", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "4bcfb1f126ec7bf64e6aa3bae5ea6396b268af08", "merged_at": "1571375700", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 28198, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Clean redundant member functions from ElectronSeed", "updated_at": "1571375701", "user": "guitargeek"}

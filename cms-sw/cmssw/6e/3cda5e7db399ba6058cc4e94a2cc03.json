This leads to a slightly increased fake rate.\n\nI've updated FastSim and Skims where necessary.\n\nOldEG mode is activated by doing:\n`runTheMatrix.py -s --useInput all  --command=\"--customise RecoEgamma/Configuration/customizeOldEGReco.customizeOldEGReco\"`\n\n@slava77 The default mode only runs one version of the of conversion tracking. Please confirm timing improvements. The OldEG mode runs both sets of conversion tracking now.\n@nancymarinelli In default mode, standard reco::Photons no longer have conversion information. \n@franzoni All validation sequences (that I could find) have been updated to point at the new ged products. If there's anything deeper you need please let us know.\n\nMatrix tests on my side:\n- default mode is fine\n- customizeOldEGReco works fine\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_0_X", "changed_files": 117, "closed_at": "1387535064", "comments": 78, "commits": 12, "created_at": "1387216359", "deletions": 612, "labels": ["alca-pending", "dqm-approved", "fastsim-pending", "operations-approved", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "eba2f9cd54b6b279d592c7dc13d8fd44ed2b1ad4", "merged_at": "1387535064", "merged_by": "ktf", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_0_0_pre11", "number": 1834, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "GED EGM RECO as default + customizeOldEGReco", "updated_at": "1403835775", "user": "lgray"}

As it was agree to use the frozen menu V1.5 for that (that was proposed in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/45939),  the earlier version V1.2 (for 2022 pre-EE era) will not be needed in this particular branch, thus it is removed to avoid possible confusions.\r\nIn order to remove the menu from the release and avoid massive relval failures, jointly with the removal commit 72a3bd0149a2dd256c21aa23bc2b34a843be1a36 there is an update of the GlobalTags in `autoCond.py` (commit 610d90883a7f4ef7b856cea8838b3f89cb8d7356) for the following keys:\r\n\r\n   * `run3_hlt_relval` : `124X_dataRun3_HLT_relval_v9`  `124X_dataRun3_HLT_relval_v10` ([diff](https://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/124X_dataRun3_HLT_relval_v10/124X_dataRun3_HLT_relval_v9))\r\n   * `phase1_2022_realistic` : `124X_mcRun3_2022_realistic_v12`  `124X_mcRun3_2022_realistic_v13` ([diff](https://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/124X_mcRun3_2022_realistic_v12/124X_mcRun3_2022_realistic_v13))\r\n   * `phase1_2022_realistic_postEE` : `124X_mcRun3_2022_realistic_postEE_v1`  `124X_mcRun3_2022_realistic_postEE_v3` ([diff](https://cms-conddb.cern.ch/cmsDbBrowser/diff/Prod/gts/124X_mcRun3_2022_realistic_postEE_v1/124X_mcRun3_2022_realistic_postEE_v3))\r\n\r\nThe first two of them contain the L1T menu tag `L1Menu_Collisions2022_v1_2_0_xml` (which is incompatible with the menu 2022 V1.5 that we are targeting to use for tests), while the third is an update requested by AlCa.\r\nThe exact content of the MC GT is still being discussed in this [cmsTalk thread](https://cms-talk.web.cern.ch/t/gt-for-the-hlt-step-of-the-2022-re-mc-production/48005/1), but these are intermediate GlobalTags for these keys that contain instead `L1Menu_Collisions2022_v1_3_0-d1_xml` (compatible with menu V1.5) such that we could (at least techincally) remove v1.2 from this branch.\r\nI am opening this PR in \"Draft mode\" because the update of `autoCond.py` is not complete, the 2023 relvals have the same issue:\r\n```\r\n$ conddb list 124X_mcRun3_2023_realistic_v13 | grep L1TUtm\r\n[2024-09-14 12:03:34,731] INFO: Connecting to pro [frontier://PromptProd/cms_conditions]\r\nL1TUtmTriggerMenuRcd                                    -                                                              L1Menu_Collisions2022_v1_2_0_xml      \r\n```\r\nso at least this one needs to be changed as well. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI performed the following tests:\r\n\r\n   * `addOnTests.py` runs fine.\r\n   * `runTheMatrix.py -l limited --ibeos` \r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

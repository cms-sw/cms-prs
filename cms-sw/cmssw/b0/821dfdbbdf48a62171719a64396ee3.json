The single function that was used from these utilities was also implemented in `EgammaElectronAlgos`. The implementation there has been moved to `EgammaCoreTools` such that it can also be used by the particle flow code without introducing a further package dependence. Maybe another location would be more adequate?\r\n* Removed simple comparator classes in favour of lambda functions, so one does not have to worry about reading an extra file just for the comparison functions\r\n* remove RecoParticleFlow/PFProducer/plugins/EFilter.h(.cc), which has not been used\r\n* all plugins that are template instantiations are now declared in plugins.cc as recommended in the new CMSSW code guidelines.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nCMSSW compiles and local matrix tests pass.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 35, "closed_at": "1553632214", "comments": 32, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1552634425", "deletions": 504, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "a99c7c9b9de211f86f212a6ad206f1672b576e87", "merged_at": "1553632214", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 26190, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 7, "state": "closed", "title": "Some RecoParticleFlow/PFProducer cleanup", "updated_at": "1553632215", "user": "guitargeek"}

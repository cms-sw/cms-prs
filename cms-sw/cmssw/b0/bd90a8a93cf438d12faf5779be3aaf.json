While testing this routine, I found three missing dictionaries for persistent classes. This has not caused a problem, because all three classes are instances of std::vector, and root can usually handle std::vector without a dictionary if it has a dictionary for T. However, such handling is less efficient without a dictionary. This pull request adds the missing dictionaries.\nThis pull request is totally technical, so signatures should be bypassed if not signed in a reasonable amount of time.\nI tested this pull request with the short relval matrix and saw no errors.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_2_ROOT6_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1403544829", "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1403544025", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "db62b3d7f60e59142239ec391fdf801d0b4ddab4", "merged_at": "1403544829", "merged_by": "davidlt", "number": 4362, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add missing dictionaries", "updated_at": "1403641415", "user": "wmtan"}

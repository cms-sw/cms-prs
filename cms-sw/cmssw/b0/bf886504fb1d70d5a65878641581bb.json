Remove `BookingHelper`, which is the wrapper of `IBooker`. Use `GEMDetId` as a key of `MEMap` rather than tuple of int numbers.\r\n  * Create cfi files for comics scenario.\r\n* Exclude `GEMOfflineMonitor` from GEM offline DQM sequence. `GEMOfflineMonitor` creates only `GEMDigi` and `GEMRecHit` occupancy plots but these plots are moved to the online DQM. However, `GEMOfflineMonitor` is not removed because it will make more diverse plots (mainly `GEMSegment`) in the near future.\r\n\r\nHere is a link to [slides](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1010727/contributions/4241619/attachments/2199578/3719850/200226-OfflineDQMUpdate.pdf)\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\nThe offline DQM GUI server is running at the local server. [Link to DQM GUI](http://offlinedqm.sscc.uos.ac.kr:50200/dqm/offline/session/oUsaUn).\r\nPlease check out the manual of GUI at the last page of the [slides](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1010727/contributions/4241619/attachments/2199578/3719850/200226-OfflineDQMUpdate.pdf)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis PR is tested with two workflows:\r\n* For pp, `runTheMatrix.py -w upgrade -l 12411.0`, which is `TenMuExtendedE_0_200+2023`.\r\n* For comics, I used custom [UndergroundCosmicMu_cfi without magnetic field](https://gist.github.com/seungjin-yang/307384bbf301391788abf2ac21c089fb), whose result is shown in GUI.\r\n\r\n@jshlee, @szaleski\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 19, "closed_at": "1614789516", "comments": 19, "commits": 8, "created_at": "1614659309", "deletions": 489, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "f77e926a1e98b3d9f1144caf3b83cb3667e23786", "merged_at": "1614789515", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 33031, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Update GEM Offline DQM", "updated_at": "1614789516", "user": "seungjin-yang"}

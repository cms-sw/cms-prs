However, users will have to manually configure and rerun HBHENoiseFilterResultProducer in case of any Run1 50ns data analysis.\n@abdoulline @igv4321 @mariadalfonso\nAutomatically ported from CMSSW_7_6_X #11789 (original by @dertexaner).\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1445335276", "comments": 9, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1445235028", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "f433fcc06f9aa377d32bf57682746e2b635c9712", "merged_at": "1445335276", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 11912, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Switch default HBHENoiseFilter settings to Run2-25ns configuration V2 - 76X", "updated_at": "1445335276", "user": "cmsbuild"}

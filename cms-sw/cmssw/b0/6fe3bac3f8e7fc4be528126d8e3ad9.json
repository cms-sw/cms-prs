Also, the method names now adhere to the CMS naming rules. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, added unit test functionality and removed the need to add the package Alignment/TrackerAlignment whenever a measurement is to be performed.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI executed the program with an example configuration and made sure it ran as expected. All changes should be transparent.\r\nAlso, a unit test can now be run to validate the PR.\r\n\r\n#### Backport\r\n\r\nBackport of #42012\r\nSlight change since unit tests use a different working folder in this CMSSW release.", "branch": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "changed_files": 12, "closed_at": "1687932916", "comments": 11, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1687758120", "deletions": 208, "labels": ["alca-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "bug-fix", "orp-approved", "backport-ok", "trk"], "merge_commit_sha": "4979f8047055ccd2cbfbb6d27638e06816b6fe64", "merged_at": "1687932916", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_13_0_X", "number": 42085, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "[13_0_X] APE measurement tool: Resolved python3 compatibility issues, added unit test functionality, removed dependency on other package: Backport of #42012", "updated_at": "1687932918", "user": "mteroerd"}

I will look at the L1TCaloLayer1 plugin soon\r\n\r\n### PR validation:\r\n\r\nAll code compiles, passes code-checks, and has had code-formatting applied. In theory this _should_ be a trivial technical fix that again _shouldn't_ be able to mess anything else up.\r\n\r\n### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

However, for both cases the code\nused an std::unique_ptr and attempted to call 'release' in the case\nof non-ownership. The problem was multiple calls to initializeGBRForest\nstill caused the code to delete a GBRForest which was not supposed to be\nowned. The code was changed to use an std::shared_ptr where we use a custom\ndeallocator in the case of non-ownership (the deallocator does nothing).\nThis problem was found in the IB RelVals.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1449552984", "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1449258337", "deletions": 13, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-available", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "af86e6847852733e38babf1689d62d1243cf9059", "merged_at": "1449552984", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 12675, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix ownership problem in TMVAEvaluator", "updated_at": "1449600383", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

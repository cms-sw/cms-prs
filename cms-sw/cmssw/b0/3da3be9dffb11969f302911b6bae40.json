The model is loaded in cmssw and runned on CPU and CUDA. \r\nThe code to generate the model is included in the PR, but cannot be run directly in CMSSW, as we are not including the Python interface to PyTorch in cmsdist for the moment. \r\n\r\n@smuzaffar @makortel @iarspider @wpmccormack \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 11, "comments": 22, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1701446396", "deletions": 9, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "requires-external", "code-checks-pending", "ml-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 43475, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 24, "state": "open", "title": "First PyTorch tests for TorchScript inference CPU/CUDA", "updated_at": "1722233103", "user": "valsdav"}

With this PR, the following features will be integrated:\r\n\r\n- A module to update the puppi weights for `pat::PackedCandidate`.\r\n- Modules to rekey PF candidates of PAT objects and `VertexCompositeCandidate` objects, from the old `packedPFCandidates` collection in the original MiniAOD to the new collection with the updated puppi weights.\r\n- Modules to update `pat::Muon`, `pat::Electron` and `pat::Photon` objects with recomputed PUPPI Isolation variables.\r\n- A customization function to setup the reMiniFromMini workflow by scheduling the necessary modules.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, the reMiniFromMini workflow is not setup to run. The purpose of this PR is to setup the machinery for the reMiniFromMini workflow and to check that the modifications in `jetTools.py` and `puppiJetMETReclusteringTools.py` do not interfere with existing MINI+NANO workflows. Once merged, a subsequent PR will soon follow to fully setup the reMiniFromMini production workflows.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n- passes the usual runTheMatrix test:  `runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all --ibeos` for a majority of the workflows. Those that failed were due to inability read files. The failed workflows are `4.22_RunCosmics2011A,4.53_RunPhoton2012B,8.0_BeamHalo,9.0_Higgs200ChargedTaus,25.0_TTbar,1330.0_ZMM_13,25202.0_TTbar_13,10224.0_TTbar_13+2017P,10224.0_TTbar_13+2017P,10224.0_TTbar_13+2017PU,12434.0_TTbar_14TeV+2023,12834.0_TTbar_14TeV+2024,12846.0_ZEE_14+2024,13034.0_TTbar_14TeV+2024PU,250202.181_TTbar13TeVPUppmx2018`.  \r\n- successfully ran a reMiniFromMini test production with a single TTtoLNu2Q Run3Summer23MiniAODv4 file, using the  `miniAODFromMiniAOD_customizeAllMC()` customization function defined in `miniAODFromMiniAOD_tools.py`.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

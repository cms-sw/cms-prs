The problem was traced to:\nhttps://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/CMSSW_8_1_X/SimCalorimetry/CaloSimAlgos/interface/CaloTDigitizer.h#L130\n\n```\ntheHitResponse->clear();\n```\n\nThe same CaloHitResponse was being used for HF QIE8 and HF QIE10. Using separate CaloHitResponse objects solves the problem. This fix was backported from 81X.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1461046991", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1460744740", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "0b6cca12d9525ca90ef4d0b34630310b35588ba9", "merged_at": "1461046991", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 14103, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "separate CaloHitResponse for QIE10", "updated_at": "1461046992", "user": "kpedro88"}

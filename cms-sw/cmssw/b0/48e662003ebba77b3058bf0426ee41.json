MC studies are ongoing that investigate possibilities to trigger on exotic signatures which produce >2 ALCTs or >2 CLCTs. Such signatures may include long-lived particles that decay to multiple muons.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces an option in the CSC trigger to write out specific ALCT and CLCT collections with the label \"All\" for such exotica studies. These collections are only useful when `MAX_ALCTS_PER_PROCESSOR` and `MAX_CLCTS_PER_PROCESSOR` is greater than 2. By default the option is turned off, so there is no change in the trigger performance.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested it with a 2026 runTheMatrix command.\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR:\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n@tahuang1991 ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1575880691", "comments": 23, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1574699358", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "431e2fdfedec052e73c16e9f06de98ade41ebc56", "merged_at": "1575880691", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 28467, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Option to write out all ALCTs and CLCTs", "updated_at": "1575880692", "user": "dildick"}

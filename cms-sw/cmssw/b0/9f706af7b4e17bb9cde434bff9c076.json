This PR patches different pieces of the existing code on the following aspects\r\n\r\n- Module locator\r\n   - there was a confusion between the module type index (typically 0-54) and module count (typically 1-500 within a FED). We have introduced an explicit method to decouple the two and start using explicitly module count\r\n   - enabled unit tests for module locator which were otherwise ran by hand locally\r\n- Data formats\r\n    - missing the generation of dictionaries for new TPG SoAs, added in this PR\r\n    - add estimated rec hit noise level (from pedestal runs)\r\n- Unpacker\r\n    - missing decompression of 10b to 12b measurement of time-over-threshold energy measurement\r\n- ESProducer\r\n    - use FileInPath starting at cfg level\r\n- RecHit calibration kernels\r\n    - introduce cut as multiple of noise instead of absolute energy\r\n    - corrected application of local e.m. and dE/dx corrections\r\n- \"Workflow 77\" configuration update\r\n    - propagate usage of FileInPath and use selection of hits &gt;5&sigma; \r\n   \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested with test beam data and workflow 77 in `16_0_0_pre1` with:\r\n\r\n```runTheMatrix.py -w standard --ibeos -l 77```\r\n\r\n\r\nFYI @lourda @cramonal @yulunmiao @IzaakWN @stahlleiton ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 21, "comments": 55, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1760362631", "deletions": 96, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "geometry-pending", "alca-approved", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "db-approved", "requires-external", "code-checks-approved", "heterogeneous-pending", "hgcal-dpg-approved", "changes-dataformats"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_0_X", "number": 49148, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 15, "state": "open", "title": "Assorted fixes post HGCAL test beam", "updated_at": "1763279779", "user": "pfs"}

This PR should only affect MC samples that use an upgraded HE.\r\n\r\nThe effect of these changes is quite small as the nonlinearity is important only at high energy. The nonlinearity corrections are only relevant below the L1 saturation E_T of 128 GeV. As multiple depths contribute to each trigger tower, this E_T of < 128 GeV is spread among multiple channels. Consequently, none of the tower constituents have an energy for which nonlinearity is important.\r\n\r\nAt today's L1 trigger primitives meeting, it was demonstrated that [1] this PR:\r\n\r\n- Has a negligible effect on trigger rates\r\n- Has a negligible effect on any L1 quantities\r\n- Improves the agreement between the TP E_T and the Method 2 reconstruction\r\n\r\nThe last point, from slide 6 of [1], most clearly demonstrates the effect of this PR and is reproduced below.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"700\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-11-07 at 12 26 23 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6534323/32510720-22046434-c3b7-11e7-870b-f2374eba26a5.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] https://indico.cern.ch/event/678785/contributions/2780378/attachments/1553502/2442798/07NOV2017_cawest.pdf", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1512050314", "comments": 15, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1510075746", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "a7cc5e55c9d91ab023b95f5b94712f878e164d7e", "merged_at": "1512050314", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_0_X", "number": 21204, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Implement HCAL SiPM nonlinearity in LUTs", "updated_at": "1512050314", "user": "christopheralanwest"}

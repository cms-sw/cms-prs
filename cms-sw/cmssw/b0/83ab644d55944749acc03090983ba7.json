This follow-up PR adds interfacing with the conditions database. Filter weights can be obtained from `HcalTPChannelParameter` object. By default, nothing changes compared to historic behavior. Two python configuration \"switches\" `useDBweightsAndFilterHE_` and `useDBweightsAndFilterHB_` have been added to the `hcaltpdigi_cfi.py` and `hcaltpdigi_cff.py` files. Activating these switches will configure to use a specific filter and obtain the weights from the conditions database.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nIn the default configuration, with the new python switches set to false, no changes are observed in HCAL TP properties.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 12, "closed_at": "1616627524", "comments": 56, "commits": 16, "created_at": "1611335848", "deletions": 17, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "geometry-approved", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "94706ff3403704194e63068cada722625ff9d133", "merged_at": "1616627524", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 32717, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 2, "state": "closed", "title": "Access Conditions DB for HCAL Pulse Filtering Weights", "updated_at": "1616627525", "user": "JHiltbrand"}

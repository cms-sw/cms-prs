As discussed with @gennai, this PR adds an additional level of printout when the algorithm fails to find a valid beamspot from the `BeamSpotTransientObjectsRcd` and falls back to the DB-stored PCL value, in the case that the input errors are not valid (should never be the case, but since it got logged (see https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/45555) it would be good to explicitly verify when it happens.\r\nI profit of the PR to remove a couple of magic numbers for the beamspot covariance matrix size. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\n`cmssw` compiles\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

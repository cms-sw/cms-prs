The following warning appears many times while building the package I'm working on, which pollutes the logs.\r\n\r\n```\r\n/cvmfs/cms.cern.ch/el8_amd64_gcc12/cms/cmssw/CMSSW_14_1_0_pre3/src/HeterogeneousCore/AlpakaInterface/interface/getDeviceCachingAllocator.h: In lambda function:\r\n/cvmfs/cms.cern.ch/el8_amd64_gcc12/cms/cmssw/CMSSW_14_1_0_pre3/src/HeterogeneousCore/AlpakaInterface/interface/getDeviceCachingAllocator.h:62:34: warning: declaration of 'ptr' shadows a previous local [-Wshadow]\r\n   62 |       auto deleter = [size](Allocator* ptr) {\r\n      |                       ~~~~~~~~~~~^~~\r\n/cvmfs/cms.cern.ch/el8_amd64_gcc12/cms/cmssw/CMSSW_14_1_0_pre3/src/HeterogeneousCore/AlpakaInterface/interface/getDeviceCachingAllocator.h:27:6: note: shadowed declaration is here\r\n   27 |       auto ptr = std::allocator<Allocator>().allocate(size);\r\n      |      ^~~\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe change is small enough to be validated just by looking at it, but I did test it to make sure that it resolved the warning and didn't break anything.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 6, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1719248966", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved", "heterogeneous-rejected"], "milestone": "CMSSW_14_1_X", "number": 45292, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Fix shadowed declaration warning in HeterogeneousCore/AlpakaInterface", "updated_at": "1719250205", "user": "ariostas"}

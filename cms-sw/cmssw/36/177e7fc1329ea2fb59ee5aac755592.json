The header defines extra system types:\r\n\r\n    float<BITS>x<ELEM_NUM>_t\r\n\r\nLet's add `cms_` prefix to our types to avoid conflicts with system\r\ntypes, which lead to compilation errors.\r\n\r\nNOTE: these types are not directly used within CMSSW.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: David Abdurachmanov <David.Abdurachmanov@cern.ch>", "branch": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1480058705", "comments": 15, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1479976162", "deletions": 11, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "d0fb898e27d79437adfa9d9089f3e6e2fecfec6a", "merged_at": "1480058704", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_0_X", "number": 16748, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add cms_ prefix to float<BITS>x<ELEM_NUM>_t typedefs", "updated_at": "1480058705", "user": "davidlt"}

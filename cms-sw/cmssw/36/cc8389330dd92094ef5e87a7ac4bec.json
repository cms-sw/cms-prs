I added resolution and efficiency plots for the L1 tracks. Since these include MC information, I have added a new package, Validation/OuterTrackerL1V, to contain these. I modified the DQMOffline/Configuration and Validation/Configuration packages slightly, to include the running of these packages in runTheMatrix.py. Here are links to a RelMon comparison for 6600 ttbar no PU events, so that you can see all the plots for the DQM package (1) and the Validation package (2). The comparisons in these webpages are meaningless, since they are comparing one sample to itself, but the webpages allow you to look through the plots I propose be added. \r\n\r\n1: http://www-hep.colorado.edu/~emacdonald16/FinalDQM/Phase2OuterTracker.html\r\n2: http://www-hep.colorado.edu/~emacdonald16/FinalDQM/Phase2OuterTrackerV.html\r\n\r\nI will also be monitoring these plots once they are included in the sequence.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 25, "comments": 2, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1521560447", "deletions": 439, "labels": ["code-checks-pending", "comparison-pending", "dqm-pending", "new-package-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_1_X", "number": 22682, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "DQM OuterTrackerL1 plots for TTStubs, TTClusters, and TTTracks for release validation", "updated_at": "1521560596", "user": "emacdonald16"}

In data, based on muon detector alignment we use a different version of PC LUT, but in MC we always use ideal aligment. This PR fixes this assignment for MC for all future PC LUTs.\r\n\r\nThis is a backport of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/41954\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with a description of the feature proposed or problem addressed, specifying:\r\n  - what changes are expected in the output if any, \r\n  - what other PRs or externals it depends upon if any,\r\n  - link to any additional material useful to provide a documentation for this PR (slides, JIRA tickets, related pull requestes, hypernews, TWiki or Indico pages)  -->\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested with `addOnTests.py` and the new GT `131X_mcRun3_2023_realistic_v6`.

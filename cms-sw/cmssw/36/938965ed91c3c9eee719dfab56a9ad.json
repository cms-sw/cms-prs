This avoids a ChiSquared test with zero degrees of freedom. The counting of filled bins was fixed for two-dimensional histograms.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with a description of the feature proposed or problem addressed, specifying:\r\n  - what changes are expected in the output if any, \r\n  - what other PRs or externals it depends upon if any,\r\n  - link to any additional material useful to provide documentation for this PR (slides, JIRA tickets, related pull requests, hypernews, TWiki or Indico pages)  -->\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe fixes were validated with [DQM_V0001_R000000001__RelValDisplacedSUSY_14TeV__CMSSW_14_1_0_pre5-PU_140X_mcRun3_2024_realistic_v11_STD_2024_PU-v1__DQMIO.root](https://cmsweb.cern.ch/dqm/relval/data/browse/ROOT/RelVal/CMSSW_14_1_x/DQM_V0001_R000000001__RelValDisplacedSUSY_14TeV__CMSSW_14_1_0_pre5-PU_140X_mcRun3_2024_realistic_v11_STD_2024_PU-v1__DQMIO.root) comparing it against itself. The file was provided by @AdrianoDee. There are still issues with histograms created using TH1::Divide for which the check between weighted and unweighted histograms fails. In these cases an unweighted test is applied to weighted histograms, leading to a rounding down of all bin contents (to zero).\r\nThis is a list of all failing histograms:\r\n[failing_list.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18674880/failing_list.txt)\r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with a description of which tests have been performed to verify the correctness of the PR, including the eventual addition of new code for testing like unit tests, test configurations, additions, or updates to the runTheMatrix test workflows -->\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

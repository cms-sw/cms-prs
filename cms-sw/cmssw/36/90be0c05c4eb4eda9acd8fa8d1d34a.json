Extending an interface to deal with the new dimension, and using the old interface for the original 3D algorithms. \n\nThe physics performance of the 3D algorithms (i.e. present LHC vertex reco) should be (and from local tests is) unaffected by this change. There may be minor performance drawbacks due to the way the backwards compatibility is kept. Alternative recommendations are welcome.\n\nThe timing is integrated directly into the phase 2 tracking reconstruction era. The overhead is fairly small.\n\n@bendavid @kpedro88\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 64, "closed_at": "1474439451", "comments": 122, "commits": 5, "created_at": "1472833637", "deletions": 264, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "comparison-available", "core-approved", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "simulation-pending", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "64b8eb362167a10d7454c17a04428cf5dfb1b0ec", "merged_at": "1474439451", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 15710, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 65, "state": "closed", "title": "Vertex Reconstruction with Timing 810", "updated_at": "1474473224", "user": "lgray"}

There is one change to a boost/bind header, which I made following the advice given with the warning. The other warnings required the removal of variables used only within LogTrace messages. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI've run CSCDigiProducer with full LogTrace active to verify the fixes work.While doing that I need to make a couple of minor changes to LogTrace statements. I plan to update the test configs used for this and other CSCDigitizer tests in a separate PR.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1627453951", "comments": 8, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1627404046", "deletions": 10, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "952cd31c3e1ded35cc75d5e0c6ab0a269b246b59", "merged_at": "1627453951", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_0_X", "number": 34652, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Fix static warnings in CSCDigitizer", "updated_at": "1627453952", "user": "ptcox"}

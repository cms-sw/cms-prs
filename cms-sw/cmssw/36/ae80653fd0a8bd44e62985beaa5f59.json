We want to merge it in 76X only if the corresponding 75X pull request ( #11484) can be merged in that queue, so that the menus dumped in the 75X and 76X queues can remain synchronized: see the description of that 75X PR for the details. Otherwise we will close this PR.\nBased on CMSSW_7_6_X_2015-09-24-2300\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 14, "closed_at": "1443540744", "comments": 14, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1443162028", "deletions": 2936, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "hlt-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "e6462e2c5e547db4090bbd62aeb21f77c4e866bd", "merged_at": "1443540744", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 11485, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "76X hlt25ns round5 plus updated frozenv4", "updated_at": "1447584478", "user": "perrotta"}

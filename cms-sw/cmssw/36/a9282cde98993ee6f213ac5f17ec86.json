In (the relevant steps of) those wfs, the appropriate GT is `auto:run*_data` afaik.\r\n\r\nThis change is expected to solve the issue discussed in #19802 for wfs involving the `PAT` step. For further details, please see https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/19802#issuecomment-1378692945.\r\n\r\nSome (not all) harvesting and skimming steps are also updated depending on whether or not they belong to `reHLT` wfs (maybe updating some of these steps with `--hltProcess reHLT` is not strictly needed, but it is arguably clearer).\r\n\r\nAs a bi-product of this PR, support for the option \"hltProcess\" is added to the SKIM step.\r\n\r\nThe wfs touched directly by this PR are the following:\r\n```sh\r\n4.17,4.23,4.24,4.25,4.26,4.27,4.28,4.29,4.34,4.36,4.37,\\\r\n4.4,4.41,4.42,4.43,4.44,\\\r\n4.45,4.51,4.52,4.53,4.54,4.55,4.57,4.58,\\\r\n4.61,4.62,4.63,4.64,4.65,4.67,4.68,\\\r\n4.71,4.72,4.73,4.74,4.75,4.77,4.78,\\\r\n136.72411,136.72412,136.7611,136.76111,136.7721,136.77211,\\\r\n136.8311,136.83111,136.88811,138.3,139.001,139.002,139.003,139.004,\\\r\n140.104,140.105,140.106,140.107,140.109,140.11,140.111,140.112,140.113,\\\r\n140.114,140.115,140.116,140.117,1010.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nNext to none.\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport, please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

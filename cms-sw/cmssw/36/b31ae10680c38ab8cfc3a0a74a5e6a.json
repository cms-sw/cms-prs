Given that the ability to run SubProcess has already been removed, this should not affect the output of anything.\r\n\r\nThere was also a minor bug in the limit when removing vertex entries corresponding to deleted modules. The limit should have been 0 instead of 1, although the likelihood of the first entry needing to be erased is small (not sure what the consequence would be even if it was not erased, maybe nothing significant.\r\n\r\nAlso checked the header includes and made some additions and subtractions.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRelies on existing tests. This does not add new functionality. Most just deletions of dead code.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1746470149", "comments": 21, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1746042683", "deletions": 71, "labels": ["core-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "768fece88286a15ea8afff5bdbf750c50bb554f3", "merged_at": "1746470149", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 47996, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "Remove SubProcess related code from the DependencyGraph service", "updated_at": "1746470151", "user": "wddgit"}

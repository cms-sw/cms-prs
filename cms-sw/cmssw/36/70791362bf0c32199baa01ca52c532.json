The modifications that have been made is limited to five files in \n- RecoTauTag/Configuration (definition of even content)\n- RecoTauTag/RecoTau (main sequence)\n- Validation/RecoTau (validation configuration) \n- PhysicsTools/PatAlgos (high level analysis configuration)\n  We've checked that the pat configuration runs in unscheduled mode with all RecoTauTagRECO in the outputCommands, i.e. all discriminators have been build and made persostent starting from relval RECO. The limited set of matrix tests (runTheMatrix.py -l limited -i all) passed w/o failures. The usual validation plot that we checked show unsuspicious behaviour (checked by TauPOg ynd ID conveners). We would like this request still to go into CMSSW_8_0_0_pre6 to be built from Monday on if possible. \n  Thanx a lot!\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 7, "closed_at": "1455783877", "comments": 26, "commits": 16, "created_at": "1455358464", "deletions": 1012, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "863ec50e80fac67c9e72a50b4754f24cc55aecb4", "merged_at": "1455783877", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 13272, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 4, "state": "closed", "title": "clean up of old tau discriminators and integration of new ones", "updated_at": "1455783878", "user": "roger-wolf"}

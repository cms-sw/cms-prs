This PR is brought in by @mbluj. It was discussed in the xPOG meeting of 05.09.2017 and detailed comparisons where shown there. All changes that are being applied set in only when using the \"run2_miniAOD_80XLegacy\" era. The default reconstruction in 93X is unaffected. I'm posting Michal's comments below for reference (*)\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nRoger\r\n\r\n(*)\r\nThis pull requests adds tau re-reconstruction to MiniAOD step for legacy re-reco of 2016 data and MC produced with CMSSW_80X. The re-reconstruction is added to MiniAOD setup (PhysicsTools/PatAlgos/python/slimming/miniAOD_tools.py) when the run2_miniAOD_80XLegacy Era is requested.\r\n\r\nExpected effect of the PR is was discussed in the xPOG on 5 September 2017 [1].\r\n\r\nNote 1: During the xPOG meeting it was agreed that the PR (when sent to official CMSSW repo) will be scrutinized, but its integration will be hold until Tau POG conveners give their final green light. The (unusual) procedure is to speedup the integration process.\r\n\r\nNote 2: The PR consists of purely technical modification of PhysicsTools/PatAlgos/python/producersLayer1/tauProducer_cff.py file: it is a cleaning which avoids re-reco of cut-based tau discriminants which in not necessary.\r\n\r\n[1] \r\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/663315/contributions/2708403/attachments/1518558/2371260/mbluj_TauId_80XLegacyMiniAOD_5Sep2017.pdf\r\n", "branch": "CMSSW_9_3_X", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1505130099", "comments": 4, "commits": 9, "created_at": "1505127530", "deletions": 117, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-pending", "tests-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_9_3_X", "number": 20453, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Adding the possibility to re-run the complete tau reconstruction on miniAOD, when using the run2_miniAOD_80XLegacy era, meant for 80X legacy sample production", "updated_at": "1505130211", "user": "roger-wolf"}

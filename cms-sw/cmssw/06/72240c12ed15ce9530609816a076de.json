The EDModule that causes the synchronization is `HitEff` that is a legacy `edm::EDAnalyzer`. The real fix would be to change that to a one of the thread-efficient module types, so the change of this PR is more like a workaround until that is done (since the intention looks like the configuration should support concurrent lumis).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested on top of #35326 that the unit test succeeds.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1632497739", "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1632496971", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["alca-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "tests-started", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "number": 35409, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Explicitly set numberOfConcurrentLuminosityBlocks to 1 in testProduceCalibrationTree_cfg.py ", "updated_at": "1632497739", "user": "makortel"}

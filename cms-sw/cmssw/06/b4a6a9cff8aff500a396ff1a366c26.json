When starting all skims simultaneously, too much CPU time was used on lxplus, resulting in some skims being killed. Therefore, submission to condor is now possible. There is also an option to submit to the CAF queue. Skimming-related scripts were moved from /test/batch to /test/SkimProducer and old, unused bash scripts were removed.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, some additional code was added so that GEN-SIM-RECO samples can be skimmed out of the box in case that should be needed again.\r\n\r\nAlso, support for the phase 0 geometry was added to the plotting tools for compatibility.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 12, "closed_at": "1578646456", "comments": 20, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1576592352", "deletions": 372, "labels": ["alca-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "0e0affe61a49c5ef38c33c4655a54ed52e8d896a", "merged_at": "1578646456", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 28638, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 3, "state": "closed", "title": "APE estimation tool: Enable submission of skims to condor, rearrange skimming tool, add phase 0 geometry support for plotting tools.", "updated_at": "1578646457", "user": "mteroerd"}

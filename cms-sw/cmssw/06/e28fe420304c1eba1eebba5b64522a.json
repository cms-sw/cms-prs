Tests *will fail* with current ROOT; needs to go in in sync with https://github.com/cms-sw/cmsdist/pull/4852 .\r\n\r\nI hope I got all the versions correct, there might have been more in other commits, but I don't know how to manually test things with cmsdist changes.\r\n\r\nBased on the numbers in commit 94610d9fbca67feb8 in the root repo.\r\n\r\nSee also https://github.com/cms-sw/cmsdist/pull/4882 for the matching DQMGUI change. Also, now we'll finally need to update `fastHadd`, once we use a > 10_6 release in online/MWGR.\r\n\r\nOn a side note: commit https://github.com/root-project/root/commit/94610d9fbca67feb898b67d97d8092eaaa960db7 indicates that our patched ROOT (we had the equivalent of https://github.com/root-project/root/commit/8c9c1a3fbe3a1c5704635f8941abeb9596104c77 since beginning of last year) had sort-of incorrect schema evolution on TH1-derived classes for quite a while. Not sure what the implications  on DQMGUI are (@rovere ?).\r\n\r\nFYI @mrodozov .\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nNone. \r\n\r\nThis only affects the schema migration test, which is mostly a reminder for us to update DQMGUI if needed. If the tests pass, it is good and has no impact on other parts of CMSSW.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 12, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1555396079", "deletions": 16, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "dqm-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "requires-external", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 26464, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Bump TObject versions for ROOT 6.14.", "updated_at": "1555524570", "user": "schneiml"}

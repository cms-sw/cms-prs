There was some discussion on there about changing era names, but then it was merged so I assume everything is okay.  If not please comment here.\n\n**The description for #12023 copied here for completeness:**\nThis adds a `Run2_2016` era that uses the stage 2 trigger. The `stage2L1Trigger` sub-era component of it is currently empty, but I'm expecting trigger experts to apply the correct commands.\n\nA `Run1` era is also added. This is foreseen as a no-operation era to help with scripting cmsDriver commands (e.g. `--era=$MY_ERA`). However, it also adds the flexibility to add customisation changes at a later date.\n\nBoth of these additions were discussed in the 20/Oct/2015 release planning meeting.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1446016588", "comments": 6, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1445944826", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["comparison-available", "fully-signed", "operations-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "f6436f46339d44430fa8c0a649656067096e663f", "merged_at": "1446016588", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 12117, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add eras for 2016 and Run 1 (76X)", "updated_at": "1446634267", "user": "mark-grimes"}

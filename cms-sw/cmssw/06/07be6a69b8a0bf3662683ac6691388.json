If a track is matched to a tracking particle of a given SIM vertex, two weights (named wos and wnt) are evaluated for that vertex, exploiting the weight with which the track has contributed to the vertex-fit. The RECO vertex is then matched with the SIM that has the highest wos. If the wos-matching leaves a SIM vertex unmatched, the algorithm tries to perform the matching using wnt weight. \r\n\r\n-Vertices and tracks plots are filled; resolution plots and pulls for tracks are filled in different categories of pT and MTD MVA.\r\n-An optional set of plots for dedicated studies has also been implemented, which can be switched on using the appropriate flag.\r\n\r\n[1] https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/Validation/RecoVertex/src/PrimaryVertexAnalyzer4PUSlimmed.cc\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe new plugin has been tested in the CMSSW_12_1_0_pre3. \r\n\r\nThe new plots adds:\r\n23.47 KiB MTD/Vertices\r\nto the previous size of all the MTD plots:\r\n1135.12 KiB MTD/ETL\r\n241.82 KiB MTD/BTL\r\n17.45 KiB MTD/Tracks\r\n\r\nThe following plots of time resolution for matched tracks and vertices have been obtained with 10 TTbar events with 200PU (WF 34834.0).\r\n\r\n![vres](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39314729/135423392-39290bd2-9cfb-4fbf-9d24-2049e224cdaa.png)\r\n![trackres-highMVA](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39314729/135423396-92cf0334-3f26-48a0-89cd-992aa59c292f.png)\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 0, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1632986355", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["simulation-pending", "dqm-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "code-checks-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "number": 35482, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "New DQM plugin for monitoring the association of vertices and tracks", "updated_at": "1632986443", "user": "gsorrentino18"}

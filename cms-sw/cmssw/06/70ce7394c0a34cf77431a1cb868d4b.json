This templated class is similar to HadronizerFilter except it is thread-safe and can run the Hadronizer concurrently for different events.\r\n\r\nThe only hadronizer that has been instantiated is Pythia8 using a dummy decayer class, ConcurrentExternalDecayDriver. \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe code was tested using a production workflow snippet where the Pythia8Hadronizer was replaced with the ConcurrentPythia8Hadronizer. In the snippet, no external decayer was begin specified.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1582097890", "comments": 23, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1581361150", "deletions": 3, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "generators-approved", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "cd9d8d7965adc4c0e9c885e3d64e9c48e9571382", "merged_at": "1582097890", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 28913, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "ConcurrentHadronizerFilter", "updated_at": "1582097890", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

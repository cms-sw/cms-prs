It also changes pLS xyz to floats instead of ints (they should be floats), and addresses a compiler warning for signed int instead of size_t.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI ran this code locally and it works fine.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1761890663", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1761760398", "deletions": 6, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "code-checks-approved", "tracking"], "merge_commit_sha": "607f03189e8d91fe2084a3b078705b08a991ac81", "merged_at": "1761890663", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_16_0_X", "number": 49258, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add pixel charge and deltaphi to LST ntuple", "updated_at": "1761890664", "user": "alexandertuna"}

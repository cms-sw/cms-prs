This is achieved by hard coding the grand summary (as it should always be there) and removing it from the python configuration file. This also removes the checks for \"Grand\" later in the code.\r\n2) Adding in a float ME 'reportSummary' to the EventInfo directory. This contains the mean of the non-negative bins in the reportSummaryMap.\r\n3) Moved ROC counting trend plots from the EventInfo directory to the PixelPhase1/ directory so they can actually be found.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1497858051", "comments": 9, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1497442295", "deletions": 22, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "ffecb3bb41645ddccc435a1138ef11f2f0646821", "merged_at": "1497858050", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_2_X", "number": 19219, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Summary map hotfixes", "updated_at": "1497858051", "user": "leggat"}

For the moment, they are a copy of what we run currently for 2025 with the idea that once 2026 parameters (conditions, HLT menu) come, we will need to fill the dummy ones (keeping them in sync with each other). For the moment: \r\n\r\n- `@relval2026` is pointing to`GRun` (@cms-sw/hlt-l2, let me know if you prefer something different there);\r\n- `auto:phase1_2026_*` symbolic GTs are copies of `2025` ones (@cms-sw/alca-l2 let me know what you think about this, I'll updated them following your suggestion);\r\n\r\nThe era is `Era_2026` that, for now, is just a copy of `Era_2025` (the same for FastSim, just fyi @cms-sw/simulation-l2). TTbar 2026 noPU/PU wfs are added to the limited matrix to be tested with PRs. The standard PU input for 2026 wfs is the same as 2025 for now. I took the chance to update also the GPU workflows to 2026 (@cms-sw/heterogeneous-l2) so that we avoid running them with the fake menu when 2025 wfs will be switching to that (as happened last year). \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nNew wfs run.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 13, "comments": 31, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1763552418", "deletions": 50, "labels": ["hlt-pending", "alca-pending", "operations-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_16_0_X", "number": 49419, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 4, "state": "open", "title": "2026 RelVal Workflows", "updated_at": "1763715816", "user": "AdrianoDee"}

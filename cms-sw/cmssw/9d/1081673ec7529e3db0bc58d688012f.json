Among other things,\nthese changes prevent unnecessary runtime use of the llvm/clang compiler to get the std::type_info\nfrom the typename when constructing a TypeWithDict from a type name.  For type names that are classes,\nthe use of the compiler is avoided entirely.  For type names that are not classes (e.g. typedefs, built ins, C-style arrays, enums, pointers, references), the compiler is used once per type, and the result  cached.\n\nThis pull request is functionally independent of the ROOT6 patch above, so they do not need to be picked up\nin the same IB.  However, the performance improvement depends on both this pull request and the new patch.\nPlease merge promptly unless there are issues.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_ROOT6_X", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1395942646", "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1395941446", "deletions": 22, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "core-pending", "db-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "afdd73ef410df19fb0468fd14c73ae0b2aff9395", "merged_at": "1395942646", "merged_by": "davidlt", "number": 3058, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Major performance improvement", "updated_at": "1396026726", "user": "wmtan"}

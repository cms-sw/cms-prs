This model tags seededcone 4 jets into 8 different classes uds, g, b, c, tau+, tau-, e, mu and regresses a pT correction for the jet. \r\n\r\nThis PR also includes changes to the jet data format to include the additional tag scores.\r\nThere are minor changes to the PF datatypes to add proper functionality for dxy \r\n\r\nThe model training is documented [here](https://github.com/CMS-L1T-Jet-Tagging/TrainTagger)\r\nThis model is specifically from [this](https://github.com/CMS-L1T-Jet-Tagging/TrainTagger/releases/tag/v0.0.0) release of the code\r\n\r\nThis model's training artefacts; firmware, model file and performance plots are located [here](https://cms-l1t-jet-tagger.web.cern.ch/TrainTagger/tags/v0.0.0/)\r\nThe cms-hls4ml model file tagged v0.0.0 is found [here](https://github.com/cms-hls4ml/L1TSC4NGJetModel/releases/tag/v0.0.0)\r\nThe _in progress_ DPS note is found [here](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1485645/contributions/6261878/attachments/2987822/5262533/l1t_jettag_dps.pdf)\r\n\r\nThis PR relies on an addition to the cms-dist externals, with the open PR https://github.com/cms-sw/cmsdist/pull/9778\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTesting of the code happens automatically as part of the model training CI, artefacts of this are found [here](https://cms-l1t-jet-tagger.web.cern.ch/TrainTagger/tags/v0.0.0/plots/emulation/)\r\n\r\nStandard code style checks have been performed as has a phase-2 Level-1 trigger cmsDriver test as documented [here](https://cmsl1tofflinesw.docs.cern.ch/Phase2/phase2recipe/)\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 13, "comments": 19, "commits": 21, "created_at": "1744036746", "deletions": 25, "labels": ["l1-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "upgrade-pending", "requires-external", "code-checks-approved", "changes-dataformats"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 47798, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[L1T] L1TSC4NGJetModel (Phase 2)", "updated_at": "1744125319", "user": "Chriisbrown"}

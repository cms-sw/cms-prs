This PR includes new anti-electron discriminators with updated MVA training (MVA6) from Fabio as well as updated MVA training for new ID discriminators from Arun. There are also some minor fixes (additional keep statements in RecoTauTag/Configuration/python/RecoTauTag_EventContent_cff.py that were causing matrix tests to throw missing module exceptions). This PR is for taus only.\n\nComparison plots can be found here:\nhttps://ytakahas.web.cern.ch/ytakahas/validation_20151201/\n\nNote: this is now working in 8_0_0_pre4. We expect the compilation issues we ran into as well as those we ran into with poison libraries were not due to issues with tau code but with the 8_0_X version used.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 12, "closed_at": "1453750696", "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1453588453", "deletions": 1697, "labels": ["analysis-pending", "comparison-available", "dqm-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "reconstruction-rejected", "tests-rejected"], "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 13042, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "80x re-miniAOD", "updated_at": "1453750696", "user": "andrewj314"}

This PR is similar to [PR#37509](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/37509), which added a skim over delayed jets using a set of HLT paths, except this skim uses a cut on MET rather than on HT. It does this using the producer/filter for delayed jets in CMSSW and skimming over the HLT path \"HLT_PFMET120_PFMHT120_IDTight_v*\".\r\n\r\nTested with high-Pt QCD samples /store/relval/CMSSW_12_3_0_pre6/RelValQCD_Pt_1800_2400_14/GEN-SIM-RECO/123X_mcRun3_2021_realistic_v11-v2/, the skimmed AOD file size was 25MB (68 events) and the unskimmed AOD file size was 1.9GB (9000 events).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRan with CMSSW_12_4_0_pre1 and used the config file \"test_DelayedJetMET_cfg.py\" which is included in this PR.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "comments": 6, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1651704398", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "pdmv-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_12_5_X", "number": 37808, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Skim for Delayed Jets, MET cut instead of HT", "updated_at": "1654847287", "user": "rtschmitz"}

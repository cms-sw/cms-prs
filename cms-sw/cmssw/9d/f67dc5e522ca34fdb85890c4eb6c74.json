A simple fix has been applied to the BTagCalibration framework (for both the CMSSW and Standalone versions) that adds an additional protection against negative eta values for taggers whose SF values are stored as a function of abs(eta).\r\n\r\nThe NanoAOD production tests have been run after performing this fix and the new SF values for jets with -ve eta values have been seen to be as expected.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1553548105", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-pending", "db-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_6_X", "number": 26248, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "BTagCalibration: Added protection against -ve eta values for SFs calculated on abs(eta)", "updated_at": "1553612901", "user": "mondalspandan"}

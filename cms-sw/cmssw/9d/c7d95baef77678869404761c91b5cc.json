Remove support for older HGCAL geometries that are no longer supported. Clean and simplify the code.\r\n\r\nCoupled with the restructuring of the code there's also a fix from @adas1994 (af8481d36e655f95f259b0646bcc1194f859f395) to the premixing workflow.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nUsual `Phase2` workflows, including `HFNose` ones. No regression expected, but for the premixing workflows that should be fixed by this PR.\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 18, "closed_at": "1608131027", "comments": 21, "commits": 10, "created_at": "1607333599", "deletions": 534, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "19088c273cfbdd3bb684a5a79c4bd7689a41846b", "merged_at": "1608131026", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_3_X", "number": 32397, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "closed", "title": "Clean HGCAL digitization.

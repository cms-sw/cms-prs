It logs payloads with invalid values of beta star and crossing angle as well as missing records in the PPS DB.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/42629\r\n\r\n#### Backporting\r\n\r\nBackport of https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/42629", "branch": "CMSSW_13_2_X", "changed_files": 6, "comments": 6, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1695737394", "deletions": 62, "labels": ["db-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "backport-ok"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_2_X", "number": 42875, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "[13_2_X] Fix LHCInfoPerLS PopCon incorrectly matching LS between OMS and PPS db", "updated_at": "1695801983", "user": "JanChyczynski"}

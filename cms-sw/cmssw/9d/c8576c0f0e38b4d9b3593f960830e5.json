Because the process name for the re-emulation was TEST, the following customization is needed:\n\nfrom HLTrigger.Configuration.CustomConfigs import MassReplaceInputTag\nprocess = MassReplaceInputTag(process,cms.InputTag(\"TriggerResults\",\"\",\"HLT\"),cms.InputTag(\"TriggerResults\",\"\",\"TEST\"))\n\nThe size of each of these RAW+RECO skims will be ~100 GB \nI do not see any reason to make this PR in 81X.\n\n@kfjack @kkrajczar \n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1477909406", "comments": 14, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1477291795", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["comparison-available", "operations-pending", "orp-pending", "pdmv-approved", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "351d97a82b352c14d3b8c294e69351870f7daaff", "merged_at": "1477909406", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_8_0_X", "number": 16325, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Central skims for pA", "updated_at": "1477909406", "user": "mandrenguyen"}

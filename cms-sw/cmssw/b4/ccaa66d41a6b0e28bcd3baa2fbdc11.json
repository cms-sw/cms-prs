One of the other errors (seen in relval 25.0) is related to this fix However, this fix still needs to be merged, as 25.0 now fails much earlier in its execution.  So, this is progress in ROOT6 land.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_1_ROOT6_X", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1392183086", "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1392160038", "deletions": 13, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "dc1745b7cfad65cafe4e16dde0742a9c6d2fdc13", "merged_at": "1392183086", "merged_by": "davidlt", "number": 2415, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Avoid ROOT6 limitation by replaceing LinkDef files with xml specs.", "updated_at": "1469448053", "user": "wmtan"}

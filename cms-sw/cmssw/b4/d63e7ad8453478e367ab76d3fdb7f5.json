It is still not final, but we are pushing it into the release so that others could actively start developing the HGCAL reconstruction using it. Currently, it has no link with the official upgrade reconstruction sequence, but a python snippet with 2 customization functions has been added in the test directory of the newly created `RecoHGCal/TICL` to be able to plug it in. The 2 customisation function will add the TICL-sequence either replacing the full reconstruction sequence or simply adding TICL on top of that. This, we believe, gives enough flexibility to the end users.\r\n\r\nThis PR is based, once again, on another PR #26194 since TICL needs the CLUE algorithm in order to properly work. I'll rebase once that PR will be integrated, but code review can start in the meantime.\r\n\r\nCurrently, TICL has 2 iterations: one for reconstructing MIP like object within HGCAL and another for generic clusters. No PID, nor energy regression nor linking has been implemented, yet.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nValidated using code-checks and the standard runTheMatrix tests, even if those tests will not cover any of the TICL code.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 31, "closed_at": "1558895948", "comments": 115, "commits": 44, "created_at": "1553848721", "deletions": 13, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "b0b9d9833fc249f8a0368c4a627b42eb1811b3a3", "merged_at": "1558895948", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_0_X", "number": 26295, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 95, "state": "closed", "title": "HGCal TICL Framework", "updated_at": "1558895948", "user": "rovere"}

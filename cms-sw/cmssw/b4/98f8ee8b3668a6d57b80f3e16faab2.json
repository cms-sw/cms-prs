As part of the conversion, a fillDescriptions method was also added.\r\n\r\nTo avoid unnecessary coupling of two modules, the static methods in the EDAnalyzer ECalSRCondTools were removed from the module and placed in a namespace.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThe code compiles and a simple test running the DIGI+HLT steps succeeded.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 9, "comments": 5, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1684348306", "deletions": 709, "labels": ["simulation-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "orp-pending", "code-checks-approved"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_2_X", "number": 41712, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "open", "title": "Convert EcalSelectiveReadoutProducer to stream module", "updated_at": "1684569937", "user": "Dr15Jones"}

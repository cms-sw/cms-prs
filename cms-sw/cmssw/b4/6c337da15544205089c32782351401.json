This simplifications, among other things, allowed pinpointing the issue described in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/31783 (which is **not** addressed here, waiting for the input from the muon pog)\r\n\r\nMoreover, also a few simplifications in the code are implemented, like avoiding repeated computations of the same quantities or reducing the loop iterations when possible. This is not expected to provide significant improvements in the timing, but it shouldn't hurt too.\r\n\r\nThe updates in the MuonIdProducer are meant to simplify and speed up the algo in a few points, and fix the name of a method which is only used internally to that producer (and therefore does not need to be propagated elsewhere).\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nI just checked that the code runs without errors in a typical Run2 workflow.\r\nNo change is expected in output: therefore, if any shows up from the automatic comparisons it may suggest some bug/typo in this implementation\r\n\r\n@trocino @ArnabPurohit FYI\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1603363356", "comments": 56, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1602682534", "deletions": 246, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "325b07c115011b85d4809b8d437e406d3551db82", "merged_at": "1603363356", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_2_X", "number": 31789, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 13, "state": "closed", "title": "Some clean up on reco muon classes", "updated_at": "1603363357", "user": "perrotta"}

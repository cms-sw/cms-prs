The list of TICL iterations to run upon is based on the process modifier.\r\nIn order to cope with the fact that at HLT not all the events have all the collections produced, several producer needed to be patched in order to be protected against missing input.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nRun the following set of workflows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrunTheMatrix.py --what upgrade -l 29634.0,29634.75,29634.752,29634.77\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

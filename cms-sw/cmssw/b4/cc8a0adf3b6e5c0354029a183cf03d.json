This can be generalized by casting the specific layer into the mother class ```ForwardDetLayer``` which is enough to get the ```BoundDisk```, and I expect this update should address the problem (to be verified).\r\n\r\nI took the opportunity to remove a few apparently unnecessary headers included.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTest wf 34634.0 does not show any difference in its DQM output.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1630232241", "comments": 8, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1630163295", "deletions": 4, "labels": ["reconstruction-approved", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "orp-approved", "upgrade-approved", "code-checks-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "2ab544dda10390d6d3629aed320cfd42d14725b1", "merged_at": "1630232241", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_12_1_X", "number": 35062, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "MTD reconstruction: replace specific forward layer with the general mother class", "updated_at": "1630232241", "user": "fabiocos"}

The data in OutputModule containing parentage information is currently incompatible with a \"global\" thread safe module. Fortunately, this data and the corresponding functions are needed only by one output module, namely PoolOutputModule. This PR moves this information from the base class into the only derived class that needs it. The thread safety of the derived class will be addressed later.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1440138449", "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1440082374", "deletions": 110, "labels": ["comparison-pending", "core-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-pending", "tests-rejected"], "merge_commit_sha": "f3bff4a3be3e710caebe4d3445adc46a0fe8e3b9", "merged_at": "1440138449", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "CMSSW_7_6_X", "number": 10889, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Move parentage code out of the OutputModule base class", "updated_at": "1440441177", "user": "wmtan"}

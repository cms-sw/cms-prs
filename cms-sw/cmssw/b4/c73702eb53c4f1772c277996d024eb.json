Detailed analysis of such a situation can be found at\r\n[https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/CMS/OnlineBeamSpot#23_Aug_2017_audio_alarm_in_run_3](url)\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the beamspot moves a lot in z direction during this 10 LS-long operation (4 mins), and it is difficult to reconstruct tracks with the present cylinder of origin setting (optimized for stable beams and normal conditions).\r\n\r\nIt seems that there is no software-signal which could tell us that LHC does an emittance scan.\r\n\r\nSince this issue persists, the only way is to increase the \"limit of the number of consecutive LSs without beamspot\" from 10 to 15. This disables the false alarms (an emittance scan usually lasts for just about 10 LSs, 4 minutes).", "branch": "CMSSW_9_2_X", "changed_files": 1, "closed_at": "1504619510", "comments": 23, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1504116951", "deletions": 2, "labels": ["comparison-available", "dqm-approved", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "fb52dcd221d11ea5e1145a22b958f3bd448cf55d", "merged_at": "1504619509", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_9_2_X", "number": 20326, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "increase beamspot alarmon thr", "updated_at": "1504621872", "user": "sikler"}

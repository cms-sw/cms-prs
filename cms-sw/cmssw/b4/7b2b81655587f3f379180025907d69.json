An alternative solution would be to copy these constants in the trigger code if these constants shouldn't be public.\r\n\r\nThe HGCAL trigger sequence has been put back in the `phase2_hgcalV9` era.\r\n\r\nDepends on external cms-data/L1Trigger-L1THGCal#9", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 19, "closed_at": "1535473985", "comments": 42, "commits": 29, "created_at": "1533811632", "deletions": 17, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "orp-approved", "simulation-approved", "tests-approved", "upgrade-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "ec7f3db06482d277dbf4e3647268cf81e77ef7e8", "merged_at": "1535473985", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_10_3_X", "number": 24256, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 32, "state": "closed", "title": "[HGCAL trigger] make code compatible with V9 geometry", "updated_at": "1535473985", "user": "jbsauvan"}

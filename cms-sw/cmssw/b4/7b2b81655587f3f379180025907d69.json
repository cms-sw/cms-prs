An alternative solution would be to copy these constants in the trigger code if these constants shouldn't be public.\r\n\r\nThe HGCAL trigger sequence has been put back in the `phase2_hgcalV9` era.\r\n\r\nDepends on external cms-data/L1Trigger-L1THGCal#9", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 19, "comments": 27, "commits": 28, "created_at": "1533811632", "deletions": 17, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "l1-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "simulation-pending", "tests-approved", "upgrade-pending"], "milestone": "CMSSW_10_3_X", "number": 24256, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 28, "state": "open", "title": "[HGCAL trigger] make code compatible with V9 geometry", "updated_at": "1534419918", "user": "jbsauvan"}

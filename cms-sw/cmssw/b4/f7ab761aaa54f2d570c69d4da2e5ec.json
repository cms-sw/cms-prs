For those charged particles:\r\n1. Fall-back to vertex association by dz is disabled in |eta|<2.4.\r\n2. Charged particles with pT>20 are protected to never be rejected.\r\n\r\nAlso update customizer function for PUPPI tune V14 for backport to 10_6 for JME-extended-NanoAODs for UL.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nValidation of the new tune is in the following presentations:\r\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/905128/#35-update-on-puppi-v14\r\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/901254/#3-ul17-puppi-v14-mc-jec\r\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/913808/#4-updates-on-ul-17-mc-jec-for\r\n\r\n#### if this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR:\r\n\r\nBackport to 10_6 to include into UL-reminiAOD.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "closed_at": "1589433796", "comments": 22, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1588242773", "deletions": 13, "labels": ["analysis-approved", "code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "a1a39aaffe224ad770b3a2f98f9cdf14edf9d7d5", "merged_at": "1589433796", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 29600, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "PUPPI tune v14 (phase-2 excluded)", "updated_at": "1589452400", "user": "ahinzmann"}

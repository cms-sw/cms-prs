When invoking `cmsRun config_file.py ...`, inside the Python config file, the contents of `sys.argv` are `[\"config_file.py\",...]` (consistent with the result of `python3 config_file.py ...`). Previously, when using `cmsRun`, the contents of `sys.argv` would be `[\"cmsRun\",\"config_file.py\",...]`.\r\n2. No need to include the `--` separator when calling `cmsRun config_file.py [args]` to pass `args` to Python.\r\n\r\nAmong other things, these changes allow removing various kludgey ways of handling the previous non-standard approach to passing arguments to Python. They also mean that index-based access to `sys.argv` shifts by 1.\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nUnit tests that were previously failing (https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/42650#issuecomment-1721644905) now pass.\r\n\r\n(Non-unit tested scripts are fixed on a best effort basis.)\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR. If this PR will be backported please specify to which release cycle the backport is meant for:\r\n\r\nUnlikely to be backported, see discussion at #42650.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 83, "comments": 23, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1695119214", "deletions": 281, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "simulation-pending", "dqm-pending", "l1-pending", "hlt-pending", "core-pending", "alca-pending", "daq-pending", "db-pending", "generators-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "hold", "tests-started", "upgrade-pending", "requires-external", "code-checks-approved", "tracking", "trk"], "milestone": "CMSSW_13_3_X", "number": 42823, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Fix usage of sys.argv in cmsRun configs", "updated_at": "1696441052", "user": "kpedro88"}

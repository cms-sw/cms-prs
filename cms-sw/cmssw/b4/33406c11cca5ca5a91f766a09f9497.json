In order to remove this last vestige of boost::shared_ptr,\nusers of EventSetup need to be converted to std::shared_ptr. This PR does this for Calibration packages.\nAlso, std::make_shared is implemented where it makes sense, because it simplifies the code and saves a memory allocation.\nThis PR is totally technical.\n", "branch": "CMSSW_8_1_X", "changed_files": 69, "closed_at": "1459859351", "comments": 6, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1459603198", "deletions": 111, "labels": ["alca-approved", "comparison-available", "l1-pending", "orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "f37cb4cf74263b247cec546abbce41f87df6667a", "merged_at": "1459859351", "merged_by": "davidlange6", "milestone": "Next CMSSW_8_1_X", "number": 13895, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "use std::shared_ptr and std::make_shared (EventSetup in Calibration)", "updated_at": "1464230173", "user": "wmtan"}

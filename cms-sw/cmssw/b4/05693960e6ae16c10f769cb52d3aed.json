The HGCalRecHit data formats were used in test beam workflows while HGCalReco formats are used by the TICL reconstruction.\r\n\r\nThis PR adapts the HGCalSoARecHits format to support the processing of testbeam data (modifying accordingly the HGCalRecHitCalibrationAlgorithms and HGCalRecHitProducers to use HGCalReco formats instead of the HGCalRecHit formats) and allows to run offline reconstruction (up to layer clusters at the moment). Thus, the HGCalRecHit data formats becomes obsolete by this PR.\r\n\r\nIn addition it sets up a new relval using as input 2024 HGCal test beam data, which requires the following cms-data PRs: https://github.com/cms-data/Geometry-HGCalMapping/pull/4 and https://github.com/cms-data/RecoLocalCalo-HGCalRecProducers/pull/1\r\n\r\n@pfs @IzaakWN \r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nThis PR can be tested using relval 77 with cms-data PRs https://github.com/cms-data/Geometry-HGCalMapping/pull/4 and https://github.com/cms-data/RecoLocalCalo-HGCalRecProducers/pull/1\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 32, "comments": 10, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1753189917", "deletions": 276, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "alca-pending", "db-pending", "geometry-pending", "pending-signatures", "orp-pending", "pdmv-pending", "tests-started", "upgrade-pending", "code-checks-approved", "changes-dataformats"], "milestone": "CMSSW_15_1_X", "number": 48606, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Adapt HGCal rechit producer for HGCal testbeam data", "updated_at": "1753194101", "user": "stahlleiton"}

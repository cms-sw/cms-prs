The HGCalRecHit data formats were used in test beam workflows while HGCalReco formats are used by the TICL reconstruction.\r\n\r\nThis PR adapts the HGCalSoARecHits format to support the processing of testbeam data (modifying accordingly the HGCalRecHitCalibrationAlgorithms and HGCalRecHitProducers to use HGCalReco formats instead of the HGCalRecHit formats) and allows to run offline reconstruction (up to layer clusters at the moment). Thus, the HGCalRecHit data formats becomes obsolete by this PR.\r\n\r\nMoreover this PR now apply energy loss and thickness corrections to the RecHits to convert charge (in fC) to energy (in GeV).

The index for the for loop does not match the if/else statements, hence causing an empty GEM/RPC TP to be created which then causes the crash when we try to create detID.\r\n\r\nThis should be backported to 12_4_X and 12_5_X to fix the same ug in those releases. \r\n\r\n<!-- Please replace this text with a description of the feature proposed or problem addressed, specifying:\r\n  - what changes are expected in the output if any, \r\n  - what other PRs or externals it depends upon if any,\r\n  - link to any additional material useful to provide a documentation for this PR (slides, JIRA tickets, related pull requestes, hypernews, TWiki or Indico pages)  -->\r\n\r\n#### PR validation:\r\n\r\nTested with running the unpacker on the data files mentioned in https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/issues/39456. Unpacker runs and assigns the correct values to GEM/RPC TPs.\r\n\r\nFile used: `/eos/cms/store/t0streamer/Data/Express/000/359/045/run359045_ls0144_streamExpress_StorageManager.dat`\r\n\r\n#### If this PR is a backport please specify the original PR and why you need to backport that PR.

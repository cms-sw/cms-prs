For the last re-reco of 2017, run2_miniAOD_94XFall17 is used\r\n(3) Small change to PhotonEnergyCalibrator/ElectronEnergyCalibrator have been done to avoid problems at the boundary. \r\n\r\nThe related txt files can be found here: https://github.com/jainshilpi/EgammaAnalysis-ElectronTools/tree/UL2017SSV2/ScalesSmearings (*24Feb*)\r\n\r\nrunMatrix passed all the tests. \r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1589045897", "comments": 48, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1587408724", "deletions": 8, "labels": ["code-checks-approved", "comparison-available", "fully-signed", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "c90a8c41f33cc289c25d9412896ae8632df08404", "merged_at": "1589045897", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "milestone": "CMSSW_11_1_X", "number": 29526, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 7, "state": "closed", "title": "[RecoEgamma/EgammaTools] Updates to EnergyScaleCorrection class for scales and smearings in UL", "updated_at": "1589045897", "user": "jainshilpi"}

The main optimization we applied was enabling ONNX Runtime graph optimizations, which automatically fuse operations such as Conv + LeakyReLU. This provided the largest speed improvement.\r\nWe also removed unnecessary transpose operations, so the model now expects the input data directly in the correct format.\r\nThe physics performance should remain exactly the same, no differences are expected. The model should simply run faster.\r\nThis still needs to be tested within the current PR that makes TICLv5 the default : https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/49932\r\n\r\nFYI @felicepantaleo ", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 2, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1771435607", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["reconstruction-pending", "orp-pending", "externals-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "number": 12, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Optimize pid onnx model for linking and clu3d", "updated_at": "1771435631", "user": "Moanwar"}

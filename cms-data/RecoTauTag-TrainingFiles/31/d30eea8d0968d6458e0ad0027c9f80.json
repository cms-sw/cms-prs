This type of disagreement is present also for older tauIDs, namely DeepTau v2p1 and old BDT-based MVA-iso.\r\n\r\nFull set of results of performance study on Run-2 and Run-3 samples can be found under the following link: https://indico.cern.ch/event/1164900/contributions/4891675/attachments/2450061/4204746/FinalModel.pdf, while result of a study of base models performance (used as a starting point) here: https://indico.cern.ch/event/1164900/contributions/4891675/attachments/2450061/4205013/deeptauv2p5_run2_run3_sample_comparison.pdf.\r\n\r\nThe new files are added on top of development branch removing old tauID models as in PR https://github.com/cms-data/RecoTauTag-TrainingFiles/pull/9, so the removal is also seen here as https://github.com/cms-data/RecoTauTag-TrainingFiles/pull/9 is not merged, yet.\r\n\r\nThis PR is intended to be propagated to cms-data for both master and 12_4_X.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "comments": 12, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1654071280", "deletions": 1286, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "externals-pending", "orp-pending", "reconstruction-approved"], "number": 10, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "New DeepTauID v2p5 model", "updated_at": "1654664490", "user": "mbluj"}

EMTF will be loading new PC LUTs reflecting the real CMS geometry, and thus new LUTs and modifications to the emulator are needed to preserve data-emulator agreement.\r\n\r\nThe emulator changes are being PR-ed separately here: cms-sw/cmssw#24617\r\n\r\nThis update is urgently needed for the DQM.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nAndrew for the EMTF team\r\n\r\n[1] https://indico.cern.ch/event/758694/contributions/3146645/subcontributions/263903/attachments/1719883/2776101/2018_09_20_EMTF_alignment.pdf", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 6, "closed_at": "1537860075", "comments": 9, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1537518860", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["externals-approved", "fully-signed", "l1-approved", "tests-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "29a8863fecaee9fc692a54f2c8fea3fb0a312d56", "merged_at": "1537860075", "merged_by": "mrodozov", "number": 16, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "EMTF new LCT coordinate conversion LUTs", "updated_at": "1537860075", "user": "abrinke1"}

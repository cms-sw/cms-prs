However, due to very low fragmentation fraction of Omega_c0 in Pythia, the filter efficiency for Omega_c0 production is < 10^-4, which would lead to Computing problems. \r\n\r\nIn order to solve it, we want to use Xi_c0 particle as a proxy for Omega_c0 by changing mass and lifetime of Xic0 to be the same as Omega_c0 has. The Xi_c0 has much bigger production, and filter efficiency would be acceptable for the central production. This is a common approach for BPH analyses with baryons, we have done it several times w/o any problems. \r\n\r\nWhile creating a new .pdl file with modified Xi_c0, we have noticed that lifetime of Charm baryons in baseline evt_2020.pdl is a bit outdated w.r.t PDG, especially for Omega_c0 lifetime (there are new results from LHCb & Belle 2, which measured Omega_c0 lifetime to be four times bigger than previous [PDG average](https://pdglive.lbl.gov/DataBlock.action?node=S047T&home=BXXX040)). \r\n\r\nThus, with this PR we have two changes: \r\n1) Updated evt_2020.pdl with recent lifetimes of charm baryons (Lambda_c+, Xi_c0, Xi_c+, Omega_c0). Changes are clearly visible in the commit \r\n2) Created a copy of updated evt_2020.pdl and changed there mass and lifetime of Xi_c0 (4132) to be the same as Omega_c0. \r\n\r\nPlease also find below the output of the `diff evt_2020.pdl evt_2020_XiC0_is_OmegaC0.pdl` command: \r\n\r\n```\r\n20a21,22\r\n> * 21/11/2024 Updated by K.

The samples of interest will use using new custom evt_2020_XiC0_is_OmegaC0.pdl file, while all other MC samples using evt_2020.pdl file could benefit from the more correct (new) lifetimes of charm baryons in general. \r\n\r\nTo access the new .pdl file, after merging this PR the backports would be needed for 10_6_X (2018 UL), 12_4_X (Run3Summer22), 13_0_X (Run3Summer23) and 14_0_X (Run3Summer24). \r\n\r\nIf you need any additional info to approve and merge this PR, please ask and we will be happy to address it.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nKirill for the BPH\r\n\r\nFYI @spolikar", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 14, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1732209416", "deletions": 8, "labels": ["orp-pending", "fully-signed", "tests-approved", "externals-approved", "generators-approved"], "number": 26, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "BPH new pdl file with XiC0 modified to be OmegaC0 and update all Charm baryons lifetime", "updated_at": "1733226250", "user": "Kiarendil"}

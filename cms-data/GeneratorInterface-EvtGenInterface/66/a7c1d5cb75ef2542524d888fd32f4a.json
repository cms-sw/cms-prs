Hence, the lifetime was reduced by 0.1 factor. This is a common practice for BPH analyses. Please find below the diff between `evt_2020.pdl` and the updated file `evt_0.1KLlifetime.pdl`. \r\n\r\n```\r\n117c117\r\n< add  p Particle  K_L0                             130  4.9761100e-01  0.0000000e+00  0.0000000e+00     0     0  1.5337382e+04        130\r\n---\r\n> add  p Particle  K_L0                             130  4.9761100e-01  0.0000000e+00  0.0000000e+00     0     0  1.5337382e+03        130\r\n```\r\n\r\nNo other CMSSW changes are needed for the central production of the needed MC samples.

It is needed for the central production of Run-3 MC samples with D0 > pi+ pi- > mu+ mu- and K0s > pi+ pi- > mu+ mu- decays. \r\nThe only change of the new pdl file is reducing the pion lifetime to make it 50 times smaller. \r\nThis is needed in order to increase filter efficiency, since we require in our filter for the pions to decay within tracker volume.\r\nW/o this change the filter efficiency is too low for the central production due to computing limitations (pions decay very far away from the tracker). \r\nNo other changes in CMSSW are required, only addition of this new file. Local checks with the usage of this file as `particle_property_file = cms.FileInPath('./evt_2020_0.02_pi_lifetime.pdl')` were successful and increase filter eff by about two orders of magnitude.\r\nSome details are discussed in the [CMSBPHMC-45](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSBPHMC-45) and [CMSBPHMC-26](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/CMSBPHMC-26). \r\n\r\nPlease also find below the output of the `diff evt_2020.pdl evt_2020_0.02_pi_lifetime.pdl` command:\r\n\r\n```\r\n20a21,22\r\n> * 27/09/2023 Updated by K.

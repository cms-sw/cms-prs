We are adding a SONIC producer for DeepMET to CMSSW to do some production tests.   Nominally SONIC is designed to enable easy use of co-processors in CMS workflows, but it can also start up CPU-based inference servers within jobs.  This PR does not affect any workflow in CMS in any way unless called specifically (the SONIC producer is independent of the general DeepMET one).  The SONIC framework requires the model files and a specifically formatted config file for the Triton server, and these are contained in this PR in the structure required by NVIDIA Triton.  Please refer to these slides for more information about SONIC and our use of NVIDIA Triton: https://indico.cern.ch/event/1143469/contributions/4799423/attachments/2416540/4135308/March_28_JetMET_SONIC.pdf", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 12, "comments": 22, "commits": 7, "created_at": "1652708611", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-rejected", "externals-pending", "reconstruction-approved"], "number": 6, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Adding DeepMET files in structure needed for SONIC", "updated_at": "1654859836", "user": "wpmccormack"}

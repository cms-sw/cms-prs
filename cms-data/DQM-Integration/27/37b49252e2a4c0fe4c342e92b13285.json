In order to properly test updates in the scouting DQM collections now, new streamer file containing this collection is needed. In this PR, I update the streamer files and json specifically for that stream and updated the documentation to include this new event content.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n", "branch": "main", "changed_files": 5, "closed_at": "1755068060", "comments": 18, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1754404864", "deletions": 19, "labels": ["tests-approved", "orp-approved", "requires-external", "externals-pending", "pending-signatures", "dqm-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "58a327c89067fd91fd43be422296caa5f8a86f4f", "merged_at": "1755068060", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "number": 12, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Changing streamer files of streamerDQMOnlineScouting for Run392642", "updated_at": "1755068061", "user": "jprendi"}

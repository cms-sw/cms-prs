A model that is aware of the different expected pT and eta spectrum of electrons from B decays and of their different displacement.\r\n2. A model where the background sample is reweighted to remove any discriminating power of pt and eta. Displacement is not provided.\r\n\r\nThe performance of these two models is compared to the current seeding approach (blue star) and an hypothetical seeding approach same selection as the current but with no minimal pT threshold. The triangle marker show the performance of the OR of the two trained models applying a cut that induces the same mistag rate (respectively 1, 3, and 10 times the mistag rate of the current seeding).\r\n![iterm2 sccpsn log_bdt_comparison](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2329596/49657364-cfbdb480-fa3f-11e8-9baf-011eb88de303.png)\r\n\r\nThe performance of the same models have been tested applying a posteriori a 0.5 GeV pT cut on the track, showing the same performance in the interested phase space. It is therefore safe to apply such a cut before computing the BDT outputs to save time.\r\n![iterm2 dnihlh log_bdt_comparison](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2329596/49657546-39d65980-fa40-11e8-87a0-655897634104.png)\r\n\r\n@bainbrid is also interested in following this thread.\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "closed_at": "1544442728", "comments": 9, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1544194307", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["externals-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "number": 10, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "BDT models for low pT electron seeds", "updated_at": "1544442728", "user": "mverzett"}

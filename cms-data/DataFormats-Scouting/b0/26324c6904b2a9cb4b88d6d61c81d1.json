These will be read by future releases to verify backward compatibility.\r\n\r\nNote the real test for this is in the unit test added to CMSSW. I will reference this PR from that PR (it will be submitted soon). After they are both approved, it would probably be better for this data PR to be merged first to avoid potential problems with the data files not being included in the CMSSW IB used for IB or PR tests. Then maybe wait a couple days to merge the CMSSW PR.\r\n", "branch": "main", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1685552094", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["tests-approved", "orp-pending", "core-pending", "externals-pending", "pending-signatures"], "number": 1, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 1, "state": "open", "title": "Add initial data files", "updated_at": "1685632589", "user": "wddgit"}

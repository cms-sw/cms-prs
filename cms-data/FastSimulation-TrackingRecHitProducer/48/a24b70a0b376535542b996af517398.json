I'll be making a separate PR later today or tomorrow to cmssw for this change. However, this config will be \"off\" by default because UL FastSim production has already begun. These data files should nonetheless be preserved here and there will be an ability to turn them \"on\" in the cmssw block of code for future studies or private production.\r\n\r\nAmong the ROOT files, I've also included a txt file that explain the numerical codes at the end of each file name. This information explains to what part of the detector the file maps (year/detector layer) and from which PIXELAV template files the resolution were generated (\"Files\").\r\n\r\n@pmaksim1 @ozamram @tvami", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 23, "comments": 3, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1628083427", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "externals-pending", "fastsim-pending"], "number": 4, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Add UL pixel resolution histograms for all years", "updated_at": "1628107331", "user": "lcorcodilos"}

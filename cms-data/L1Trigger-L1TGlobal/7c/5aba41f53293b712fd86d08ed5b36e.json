Two different issues were found out:\r\n- format of the PS table (some documentation and a recipe can be found [here](https://github.com/cms-l1-dpg/L1MenuRun3/tree/master/development/L1Menu_Collisions2022_v1_0_0/PrescaleTable));\r\n- usage of the fractional PS (https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/37046).\r\n\r\nOnce that these new files are available here, we will follow-up with the PR to update the [PrescalesVetosFract_cff.py](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/L1Trigger/L1TGlobal/python/PrescalesVetosFract_cff.py) file: https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/37453.\r\n\r\n[1]\r\nhttps://github.com/cms-l1-dpg/L1MenuRun3/tree/master/development/L1Menu_Collisions2022_v1_0_0", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "comments": 7, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1648996623", "deletions": 3842, "labels": ["orp-pending", "tests-approved", "fully-signed", "externals-approved", "l1-approved"], "number": 9, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Updated files for the v1_0_0 menu for Run 3 ", "updated_at": "1649251155", "user": "elfontan"}

For now, the PS table is pretty much the copy of the last 2018 PS table. The update of these files is needed in order to provide a structure of the PS and masks tables fully compatible with the updated menu, so that it is usable for development purposes. \r\n\r\nA minor update of the files from the previous PR https://github.com/cms-data/L1Trigger-L1TGlobal/pull/9) is also included.\r\n\r\nIn the context of the trigger studies for the preparation of the Run 3 menu (L1+HLT), we faced an issue related to the emulation of the L1 prescales. Two different issues were found out:\r\n- format of the PS table (some documentation and a recipe can be found [here](https://github.com/cms-l1-dpg/L1MenuRun3/tree/master/development/L1Menu_Collisions2022_v1_1_0/PrescaleTable));\r\n- usage of the fractional PS (https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/37046).\r\n\r\nOnce that these new files are available here, we will follow-up with the PR to update the [PrescalesVetosFract_cff.py](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/L1Trigger/L1TGlobal/python/PrescalesVetosFract_cff.py) file.\r\n\r\n[1]\r\nhttps://github.com/cms-l1-dpg/L1MenuRun3/tree/master/development/L1Menu_Collisions2022_v1_1_0", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 8, "comments": 4, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1654439505", "deletions": 19, "labels": ["orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "externals-pending", "tests-pending", "l1-pending"], "number": 11, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Updated files for the v1_1_0 menu for Run 3 (and minor fix for v1_0_0)", "updated_at": "1654675986", "user": "elfontan"}

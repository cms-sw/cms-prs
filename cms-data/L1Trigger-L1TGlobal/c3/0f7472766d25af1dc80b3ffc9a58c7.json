The current version of the updated L1 Menu can be found in [1]: _L1Menu_Collisions2022_v0_1_5_.\r\nIn the context of the trigger studies for the preparation of the Run 3 menu (L1+HLT), we recently faced an issue related to the emulation of the L1 prescales. Two different issues were found out:\r\n- format of the PS table (some documentation and a recipe can be found [here](https://github.com/cms-l1-dpg/L1MenuRun3/tree/master/preliminary/L1Menu_Collisions2022_v0_1_5/PrescaleTable));\r\n- usage of the fractional PS ([PR#37046](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/37046)).\r\n\r\nOnce that these new files are available here, a PR to update the [PrescalesVetosFract_cff.py](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/blob/master/L1Trigger/L1TGlobal/python/PrescalesVetosFract_cff.py) file will be prepared.\r\n\r\n[1]\r\nhttps://github.com/cms-l1-dpg/L1MenuRun3/tree/master/preliminary/L1Menu_Collisions2022_v0_1_5\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 5, "comments": 8, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1646084278", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-approved", "externals-pending", "l1-approved"], "number": 8, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Inclusion of a new set of xml files compatible with the updated L1 menu for Run 3", "updated_at": "1646745262", "user": "elfontan"}

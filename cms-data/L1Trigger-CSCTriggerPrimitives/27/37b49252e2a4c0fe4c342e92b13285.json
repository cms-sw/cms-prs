In the current form, there are 5 patterns (0 through 4) and 2048 comparator codes. LUTs are also available with floating point values (for reference). A third set of LUTs convert the Run-1/2 patterns to Run-3 patterns.\r\n\r\nThe firmware dataword for each pattern and comparator code is 9 bits long:\r\n   - [3:0] is slope value\r\n   - [4] is slope sign\r\n   - [8:5] is position offset\r\n\r\n\r\n@tahuang1991", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 31, "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1629920671", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["l1-pending", "orp-pending", "externals-pending", "pending-signatures", "tests-pending"], "number": 12, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Lookup tables for CCLUTv2", "updated_at": "1629920694", "user": "dildick"}

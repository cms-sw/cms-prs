That can either be a position offset or a slope. In the current form, there are 5 patterns (0 through 4) and 4096 comparator codes. For the position offset, there is an ideal case and a realistic case. The ideal case does not take into account a global offset from alignment effects, while the realistic case does. In future versions, the values in the look-up-tables will be translated from floating point to unsigned int.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 16, "closed_at": "1594204433", "comments": 25, "commits": 6, "created_at": "1584379502", "deletions": 1, "labels": ["comparison-available", "externals-approved", "l1-pending", "orp-approved", "pending-signatures", "requires-external", "tests-approved"], "merge_commit_sha": "175d8557397f4fd7443076bfb0d64464d20e034a", "merged_at": "1594204432", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "number": 1, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add LUTs for CSC stub position offset and bending value.", "updated_at": "1594204433", "user": "dildick"}

Adding required model structure and configuration files for SONIC implementation of ParticleNet (PN) from MiniAOD for Ak4 and Ak8 jets.  Also including the Higgs Interaction network, as that is run through the same producer as PN.  Structure of additions and use of symbolic links for model files was previous approved and used here: https://github.com/cms-data/RecoBTag-Combined/pull/48.\r\n\r\nTagging @kpedro88 @yongbinfeng @violatingcp", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 33, "comments": 3, "commits": 3, "created_at": "1698428938", "deletions": 8, "labels": ["orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "externals-pending", "tests-pending", "reconstruction-pending"], "number": 53, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Adding SONIC structure for new ParticleNet and Higgs IN models + ONNX model update", "updated_at": "1698772629", "user": "wpmccormack"}

The network for AK4 jets performs jet flavor classification, tau ID and reconstruction, and jet pT regression, while the network for AK8 jets performs both jet classification and resonance mass regression, including for the first time resonance decays to hadronic taus. More details are available in the included README files.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 12, "comments": 2, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1676029826", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "externals-pending", "tests-pending", "reconstruction-pending"], "number": 50, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "add ParticleNetFromMiniAOD models", "updated_at": "1676555007", "user": "scooperstein"}

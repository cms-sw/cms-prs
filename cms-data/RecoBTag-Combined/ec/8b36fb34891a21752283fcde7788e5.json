This network will perform an inclusive tagging combining b/c/tau/lep jet identification and jet energy regression (both the regression and the resolution estimation via quantile regression). The model is trained with a specific robust training combining adversarial training and domain adaptation for reducing the impact of the data/MC disagreement on the final performance. The output nodes of the domains are also kept for exploring the possibility of efficiency mapping and their impact later.\r\n\r\nPlease note: a last training is ongoing trying to improve the current performance via an enriched dataset. A modification of the final model could occur.

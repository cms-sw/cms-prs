This model is validated and results are shown in the above mentioned presentation.\r\n\r\n**This PR includes:**\r\n\r\n- The fixed DeepJet onnx model with Softmax layer included.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 1, "comments": 5, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1749139796", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "externals-pending", "tests-pending", "reconstruction-pending"], "number": 69, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "fix:Phase2 onnx model with added Softmax layer", "updated_at": "1749204658", "user": "uttiyasarkar"}

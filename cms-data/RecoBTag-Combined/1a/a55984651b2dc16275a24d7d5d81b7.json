In case we want to evaluate the nominal model instead, this is included as a fallback option, not to be used for official productions. This is why in total, three files are added.\r\n\r\nAll models included here have been trained on 122X samples with PUPPI jets, prepared via DeepNTuples -> DeepJetCore -> PyTorch -> ONNX.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 3, "closed_at": "1683205642", "comments": 5, "commits": 4, "created_at": "1680608005", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "externals-pending", "tests-pending", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-pending"], "merge_commit_sha": "f2d044d90e80566e6f9084f8504d1b5840f232b1", "merged_at": "1683205641", "merged_by": "cmsbuild", "number": 51, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "closed", "title": "Add 122X trainings of DeepJet and ParTAK4", "updated_at": "1683205642", "user": "AnnikaStein"}

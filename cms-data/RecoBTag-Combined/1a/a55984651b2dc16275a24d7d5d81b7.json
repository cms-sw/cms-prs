We will likely tweak the ParTAK4.onnx file one more time.\r\n\r\nBoth models included here have been trained on 122X samples with PUPPI jets, prepared via DeepNTuples -> DeepJetCore -> PyTorch -> ONNX.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 1, "commits": 2, "created_at": "1680608005", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "externals-pending", "tests-pending", "reconstruction-pending"], "number": 51, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Add 122X trainings of DeepJet and ParTAK4 (WIP)", "updated_at": "1680608028", "user": "AnnikaStein"}

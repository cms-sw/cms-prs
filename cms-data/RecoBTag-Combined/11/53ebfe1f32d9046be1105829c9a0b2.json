The topic has been discussed on Monday's JMAR meeting [[slides]](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1438225/contributions/6053213/attachments/2915795/5117048/24.08.26_JMAR_Status%20of%20GloParT%20for%20AK8%20jets%20(v2024.08).pdf).\r\n\r\nThe current ONNX model serves as a placeholder for incorporating the PR into CMSSW. As discussed in the meeting, the CMSSW PR will be finalized this week, while we have approximately three additional weeks to finalize the GloParT 3 model.\r\n\r\nFor context, during our development history, GloParT 2 has already been validated to function properly within CMSSW (using this branch: https://github.com/colizz/cmssw/tree/dev-130X-glopart), although it has not been integrated. We are now in the final stages of upgrading from version 2 to version 3, and the GloParT 3 model will be uploaded within 2-3 weeks.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 2, "comments": 2, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1724875913", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "externals-pending", "tests-pending", "reconstruction-pending"], "number": 61, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Add GloParT model (a placeholder)", "updated_at": "1724875937", "user": "colizz"}

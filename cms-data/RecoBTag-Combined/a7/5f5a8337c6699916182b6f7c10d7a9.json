However as this PR is in combination with another to CMSSW adding a custom Run 3 PFScouting NanoAOD (https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/40438), we would like to include these first versions of the models already now.", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 9, "comments": 5, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1673008273", "deletions": 0, "labels": ["pending-signatures", "externals-pending", "tests-pending", "orp-approved", "reconstruction-approved"], "number": 49, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "Add PartcileNet ONNX models for Run 3 PFScouting", "updated_at": "1696852517", "user": "alintulu"}

This network is meant to be included in a set of trigger paths for the 2023 data-taking V2 menu. Since taus are now included by default, there is no longer a separate network included without taus. Merging this pull request will enable the deployment of the new 2023 4j2b trigger paths.\r\n\r\nHiggs trigger contacts: @mstamenk @portalesHEP\r\nBTV@HLT conveners: @NiclasEich\r\n\r\n", "branch": "master", "changed_files": 4, "comments": 1, "commits": 1, "created_at": "1681297742", "deletions": 426, "labels": ["orp-pending", "pending-signatures", "externals-pending", "tests-pending", "reconstruction-pending"], "number": 52, "release-notes": [], "review_comments": 0, "state": "open", "title": "update ParticleNetAK4@HLT trainings for 2023 data-taking", "updated_at": "1681297770", "user": "scooperstein"}
